    "body": "@ctiller: this issue is about making our Windows workers compatible with our scripts' becoming source-compatible-with-both-versions even if we choose to keep our own test infrastructure 2.7-only.\r\n\r\nAs to the separate question of whether our scripts should be source-compatible-with-both-versions: only to the extent that we want to make contributing to the codebase smooth for developers who are working in a Python-3-only or Python-3-first environment (so my answer is an emphatic \"yes!\", because there are more and more such developers and environments every day). It's already the case that developers can _use_ gRPC Python with Python 3; I think it's worth the little work it would take to make it the case for developers to fix, modify, and extend gRPC with Python 3.\r\n\r\nNow as to the also-separate question of whether or not we should _drop_ our use of 2.7 in our testing infrastructure: [the clock is only ticking](https://pythonclock.org/) and the maintainers have pushed back on all but the most high-priority security fixes. Our Jenkins installation is nearly two years old; what are the odds that it will still be around after another three years?"
