    "body": "@yang-g : this PR escalated quickly. So making `ByteBuffer` a first class citizen in the `.grpc.pb.h` files meant that `SerializationTraits<ByteBuffer>` would get pulled in by files in the `codegen` directory. As a result, `ByteBuffer::operator=` had to get moved out of `src` and into `codegen`. Additionally, we had to change to using from `Status::OK` to `core_codegen->ok()`. So far no problems, IMO, since we're already using `core_codegen` features in the implementation of `ByteBuffer`.\r\n\r\nThen there was still a hole in the microbenchmarks. The `Library` instantiator there didn't actually initialize the library, so there was nothing that was bringing alive the `core_codegen` now needed by `ByteBuffer` for the `ByteBuffer` microbenchmarks. So, this needs to get another review, IMO.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n"
