    "body": "This requires:\n- A private temporary repo with a specific directory structure to put our podspecs in. When we are public, we'll just move them to the public Cocoapods repo.\n- If we can't have an extra repo, it _might_ work in the grpc/grpc repo, if we create the needed Specs top level directory. Not pretty, but again, it's temporary.\n\nAs this doesn't block development (only becoming public), it'll wait for @jayantkolhe to get more info about private repos availability.\n"
