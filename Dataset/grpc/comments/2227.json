JavaScript uses standard (IEEE 754 double precision) floating point numbers, the same type that most major languages call `double`. That type cannot precisely represent all numbers, and what you are seeing is just an artifact of that.\n\nIf you need to communicate a precise decimal number, your best bet is to represent it as a string.\n"

This is stuff above my paygrade, so I didn't know if it was possible to use https://github.com/dtrebbien/BigDecimal.js behind the scenes or something.\n\nVery interesting sidenote: my buddy convinced me to try it with `double` instead of `float` and I was like 100% sure it was on the JS side and wouldn't make a difference since JS doesn't distinguish between those types.\n\n...but lo and behold, using the same exact code above, but using `double` instead of `float`, the assertion passes!\n"

    "body": "Upon re-reading your code, I realize that using `double` should work, but not because it actually represents the number precisely. When you `encode`, you convert the number to a `float`, which is a narrowing conversion (because floats are only 32 bits long, and doubles are 64 bits long), and than changes the value. On the other hand, when you use `double`, it's using the same representation throughout. Basically, you're confirming that when you take the `double` representation of `11.11`, convert it to a `double`, then convert it back to a `double`, you end up with the same number.\n"
