    "body": "Thanks for pointing this out. For this particular issue I'll try it out. For reachability, we are not doing any preflight (or I do not think that is preflight). We only care about network transition. The reason why we proactively destroy channels are because the BSD sockets that Apple provides does not error out during some cases of the network transition activities. Destroying channels is a mitigation of this problem to initiate channel destroy from the top in these cases. Once we integrates CFStream it is likely we can get rid of this part of code."
