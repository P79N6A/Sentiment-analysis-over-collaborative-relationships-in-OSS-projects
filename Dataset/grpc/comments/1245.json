I wonder if we need to export some symbols, e.g. `grpc_rb_cEvent`.\n\nThese variables need to be exported only if:\n- you need to refer the variable in another compilation unit in your extension library; or\n- you want other extension libraries to directly access to your implementation details for some reasons, e.g. performance.\n\nI guess this is not the case for these symbols in this extension.  If so, you can keep them in static storage and I'm happy to write another pull request.\nWhat do you think?\n"
