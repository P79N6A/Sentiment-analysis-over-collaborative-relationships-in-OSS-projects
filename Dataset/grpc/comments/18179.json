    "body": "The problem with your suggesting is that Grpc.Tools is meant to be a build-only dependency (it is only needed for code generation locally in your project, projects depending on project using Grpc.Tools should know nothing about Grpc.Tools being used).\r\n\r\nSo adding a Google.Protobuf dependency (which should propagate transitively) to Grpc.Tools actually leads to wrong usage pattern.\r\nAlso see \"PrivateAssets=\"All\" in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/csharp/BUILD-INTEGRATION.md for details.\r\n\r\nWe might have a metapackage in the future that will include Grpc + Protobuf as one bundle.\r\n\r\n"
