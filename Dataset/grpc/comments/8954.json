    "body": "This seems like a reasonable request. But it also looks like an API breakage, and I really want to avoid API breakages if at all possible. And there's no indication in the Stream API documentation that `error` and `end` are supposed to be mutually exclusive, so I don't think I can reasonably call the current behavior a bug.\r\n\r\nIf you know of some documentation that indicates that custom streams should behave as you describe, that would help."

    "body": "I posed this question in [a tweet](https://twitter.com/stephenplusplus/status/806565478806290432).\r\n\r\n> readable emit 'end', writable emit 'finish'. in case of errors no official guarantees (some emit close, others, error)\r\n> [end-of-stream](https://github.com/mafintosh/end-of-stream) handles most cases for you (non-trivial)\r\n> \\- @mafintosh\r\n\r\nI understand the concern about breaking the API. And based on that feedback, it doesn't appear to be a bug. It is inconvenient for users, however. While they will have separate success and error handlers, they will still need to check to see if the other handler executed.\r\n\r\nWith things the way they are currently, it is very difficult to implement a retry strategy. For reference, [this is the code](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-node/pull/1872/files) we put together to handle the issue in GCN.\r\n\r\n@jmuk -- was this a problem for you when implementing a retry strategy in GAX? Have you run into this before and maybe have a clever way to handle it?"
