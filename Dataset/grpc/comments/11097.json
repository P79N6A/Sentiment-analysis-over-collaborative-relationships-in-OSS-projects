    "body": "@jtattermusch The build seems to be red partly because this PR is broken and partly due to flaky tests. I am about to upload a fix for the PR brokenness. Here is my understanding of how it's broken and an appropriate way to fix it:\r\n\r\nThis PR currently breaks the `tools/run_tests/sanity/check_sources_and_headers.py` check: The `grpc++_base` filegroup (or target, as this script calls it in its error output) has files that `#include` stuff from the `grpc_base` filegroup.\r\n\r\nI tried to fix this by just adding a `deps` dependency from the `grpc++_base` filegroup to the `grpc` lib. This works for the `libgrpc++.a` target, but that pulls in ssl stuff into the `grpc++_unsecure` target and breaks it with duplicate symbols.\r\n\r\nI tried to fix that by changing the added `deps` dependency from `grpc` to `grpc_base`, but that is not valid because `grpc_base` is not a `lib`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo: The `check_sources_and_headers.py` script requires that `grpc++_base` has a `uses` or a `deps` dependency to `grpc_base`. Because of the reasons outlined in the initial PR comment, it can't be a `uses` dependency. Because `grpc_base` is a filegroup and not a lib, it can't be a `deps` dependency either. A `deps` dependency could point to `grpc` instead, which makes the `grpc++` target work but it breaks the `grpc++_unsecure` target.\r\n\r\nI think a good way to fix this is to make `grpc_base` a lib instead of a filegroup. That way, both secure and `*_unsecure` targets can depend on it, and the `grpc++`/`grpc++_unsecure` targets can depend on it without pulling in all the `gprc_base` .o files in their static library outputs, which causes duplicate symbol errors. Furthermore, this change makes the build more similar to how the Bazel `BUILD` file is structured, where everything is a lib.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnother note: The `grpc++_cronet` target is broken in master too, because of essentially the same reasons as `grpc++`. The new commits that I'm just pushing fixes `grpc++_cronet` too."

These\nlibraries are basically different flavors or the gRPC C core library.\n\nI agree that for others (specifically the C++ libraries) this is\nquestionable.

What I have found is:\n>\n>    - The build.yaml file has a \"filegroup\" concept that is a little bit\n>    like a library in that it is a group of files with dependencies, but it\n>    does not correspond to an actual build target.\n>    - The BUILD file does not have \"filegroups\"; most of the build.yaml\n>    filegroups are declared as grpc_cc_library()s.\n>    - It seems like the intention is that programs using C++ gRPC should\n>    need to link against SSL, Protobuf and gpr separately.\n>    - I can't tell if the intention is that programs using C++ gRPC should\n>    need to link against both libgrpc++.a and libgrpc.a or only libgrpc++.a\n>\n> I think programs that are using gRPC C++ should link against both\nlibgrpc++ and libgrpc.\n\n\n>\n> Based on this, I have concluded that I believe that it is not against what\n> the authors of this system intended to make it so that programs using C++\n> gRPC should need to link against both libgrpc++.a and libgrpc.a.\n>\n> Given that belief, I think the line in build.yaml that states that the\n> grpc++_base filegroup should use (aka include) grpc_base is wrong. It is\n> sufficient that the lib entries in that file say that the things that have\n> the grpc++_base filegroup depend (as in target_link_libraries in CMake)\n> on grpc.\n>\n> Removing that one line from build.yaml makes the generated CMakeLists.txt\n> file have far fewer duplicates, and (more importantly) makes it possible\n> for my CMake based application to use gRPC.\n>\n\nI think you are right in terms of removing grpc_base from shouldn't be part\nof grpc++_base - so removing the 'uses' is correct. I am less convinced\nabout other changes being done in this PR (what does it fix to change\ngrpc_base from a filegroup to a library?) AFAIK, grpc_base is defined as a\nfilegroup to avoid having grpc_base library generated by the makefile.\n\n\n> ------------------------------\n> You can view, comment on, or merge this pull request online at:\n>\n>   https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11097\n> Commit Summary\n>\n>    - Remove wrong \"uses\" clause of grpc_base in grpc++_base\n>    - Regenerate projects using generate_projects.sh\n>\n> File Changes\n>\n>    - *M* CMakeLists.txt\n>    <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11097/files#diff-0> (329)\n>    - *M* Makefile <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11097/files#diff-1>\n>    (338)\n>    - *M* build.yaml <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11097/files#diff-2>\n>    (1)\n>    - *M* tools/doxygen/Doxyfile.c++\n>    <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11097/files#diff-3> (12)\n>    - *M* tools/doxygen/Doxyfile.c++.internal\n>    <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11097/files#diff-4> (249)\n>    - *M* tools/run_tests/generated/sources_and_headers.json\n>    <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11097/files#diff-5> (3)\n>    - *M* vsprojects/grpc.sln\n>    <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11097/files#diff-6> (1)\n>    - *M* vsprojects/vcxproj/grpc++/grpc++.vcxproj\n>    <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11097/files#diff-7> (378)\n>    - *M* vsprojects/vcxproj/grpc++/grpc++.vcxproj.filters\n>    <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11097/files#diff-8> (780)\n>    - *M* vsprojects/vcxproj/grpc++_unsecure/grpc++_unsecure.vcxproj\n>    <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11097/files#diff-9> (375)\n>    - *M* vsprojects/vcxproj/grpc++_unsecure/grpc++_unsecure.\n>    vcxproj.filters <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11097/files#diff-10>\n>    (780)\n>\n> Patch Links:\n>\n>    - https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11097.patch\n>    - https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11097.diff\n>\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11097>, or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AJeq5IxNYQz1aIjKow_W9K9Q1NC7e_3vks5r43x4gaJpZM4NYkrN>\n> .\n>\n"

For my purposes, since CMake keeps track of these dependencies, it doesn't matter but I totally understand if you don't want it.\r\n\r\nThe reason I did the additional changes is that the `tools/run_tests/sanity/check_sources_and_headers.py` script, which is run as part of your CI tests, breaks if only the `uses` line is removed, because the `grpc++_base` filegroup has dependencies to files in `grpc_base` and without the `uses` line, they become undeclared dependencies, which that script prohibits.\r\n\r\nMaking `grpc_base` a library was the way I could come up with that silences that error. Do you have any other suggestions for how this can be fixed?\r\n\r\nIdea: I could make a `grpc_base_headers` filegroup, and add it to `uses` of grpc_base and `grpc++_base`. I think that could silence the errors. What do you think?\r\n\r\nI'll rebase once I know what to do."
