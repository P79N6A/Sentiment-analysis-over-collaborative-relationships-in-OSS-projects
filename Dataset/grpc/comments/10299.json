The good news is this we made it on time for the v1.17.x branch cut so the fix is going to be available in the v1.17.0 release (coming in about two weeks).\r\n\r\nSorry it took so long, we are trying our best to review things on time, but this time we really screwed up by failing to address 3 separate PRs for the same issue. I think partially the problem was coming from the fact that we are maintaining multiple build systems and each one is pretty complex (and requires a specific knowledge set that not everyone on the team has), so engineers on the team are careful in accepting build system changes (that have the potential to break lots of things and aren't always easy to test). We are thinking of how we can improve the process so things like this don't happen again."
