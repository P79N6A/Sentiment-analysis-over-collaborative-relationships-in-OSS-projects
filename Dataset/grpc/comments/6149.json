    "body": "The hybrid end2end tests failed. The tests will have to be rewritten . The following is the issue:\n\nThe problem here is that the sync server uses a `ServerCompletionQueue` (lets call it `cq1` ) and ensures that an internal thread always calls `grpc_completion_queue_next()` on `cq1`. (Note that even if the application registers more completion queues with the server, the Sync server does not call `grpc_completion_queue_next()` on those completion queues)\n\nNow, when using the hybrid model, the async part of the server implementation (which is owned by the application implementing the async server) will have to create a new completion queue (lets call it `cq2`) and register with the server. To handle Async methods, it will have to do `grpc_completion_queue_next()` on `cq2` [note: It has to create a new completion queue since it cannot access the Sync server's completion queue `cq1` - i.e there is no API that exposes that server completion queue] \n\nWhen the server starts:\n-- The C++ sync server part ensures that `grpc_completion_queue_next()` is called on `cq1` on thread `T1`\n-- The application calls `grpc_completion_queue_next()` on `cq2` on thread `T2`\n\nA client creates a channel to this server. Both `T1` and `T2` wake up. If we assume that thread `T2` is the one that actually `accepts` the channel , then as per this PR, the channel is affinitized to `cq2` (i.e the new `fd` for the channel is added to the pollset corresponding to `cq2`).\n\nNow all calls on that channel will only be processed if `grpc_completion_queue_next()` is called regularly on `cq2`. If not, the calls would stall (from client's perspective). This is what was happening in the hybrid tests.\n"

    "body": "Added the option to mark a server completion queue as 'non listening'.  A non listening completion queue is not added to server's cq list (and hence does not get any listening fd in its pollset). \n\nI am using the term \"is_frequently_polled\" at the C++ layer (and \"non_listening\" at the core layer). I felt that the term `is_frequently_polled` would clearer than `is_non_listening` to the user calling `ServerBuilder::AddCompletionQueue(bool is_frequently_polled = true)`  API\n"
