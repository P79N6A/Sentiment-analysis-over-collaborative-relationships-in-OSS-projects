    "body": "Preemption: the reason why there was indirection to begin with was to be able to intercept the `distutils` C compiler version s.t. we could ensure that special compiler flags (e.g. `pthreads`) would always be sent to _exactly_ the right compiler (i.e. whichever `distutils` was about to use), as opposed to choosing compiler flags based on platform (i.e. running on the assumption that every platform follows some ideal w.r.t. compiler environments 100% of the time). That it was going through `Cython` instead of through `setuptools` was a mistake (with no documentation support advising one way or the other to the best of my knowledge).\n"
