    "body": "Thanks @nicolasnoble , it looks like that you are right but this is the first gem that I see with this problem so I don't think that you can blame ruby only, you must be doing something non-conventional that result into this.\r\n\r\nAnd this breaks some automatic Debian packaging system because it is unable to find the required x86-64 libraries on the i386 system where the gem is installed... which is what triggered us to file this bug.\r\n\r\nAt the very least you could possibly add some work-around rule in the build system that would remove the undesired file after build, no? Thanks for considering."

That's... how it works. You wouldn't see this otherwise, indeed.\r\n\r\nWhat I am saying is that it's a single external command that builds all of the .so files for all the versions, drops that \"default\" one here, and then packages everything. We haven't done anything that would do that otherwise, and I have no idea how we could add any level of workaround into a single-command black-box build system."
