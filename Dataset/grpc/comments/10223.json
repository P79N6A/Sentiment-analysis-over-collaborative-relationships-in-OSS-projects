    "body": "Are you able to deliver signals to your server ? If so, your server can start its own graceful shutdown in the signal handler.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is up to specific services if they want to just have an API method called Shutdown (or Quit ) that simply call the gRPC Server's Shutdown() method. However this would have to be a service-owner decision and we will not want to standardize something like this because this will need careful auth checks on public servers."
