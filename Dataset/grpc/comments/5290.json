    "body": "We could avoid separate client implementation by using Moq for example\n\n`var mock = new Mock<IMathClient>()` and then you don't need to manually implement. I didn't use Moq here because: 1. I wasn't sure if I wanna take that dependency yet   2. Moq is somewhat clumsy when working with generic types, so perhaps there is a better solution (different library or us providing a better support).\n"
