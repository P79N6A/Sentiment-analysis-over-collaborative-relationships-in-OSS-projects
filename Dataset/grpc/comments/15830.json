    "body": "Hi Mehrdad. Separating the extensions into multiple packages is a valid idea, many Python library does that. With proper documentation and examples, developers are fine using those big or small extensions. For example, in `Flask` they have 68 different extension packages [Extension List](http://flask.pocoo.org/extensions/), and it is the same for `Sphinx`, `Requests`, etc.."

    "body": "The problem that you will face is interdependencies across these especially when status comes into play. I strongly discourage you from going this route. I don't think the other packages are a good metaphor here at all, since these things are supposed to be part of main gRPC package and the only reason they are not is that we do not want to add an additional protobuf dependency. However, the examples you mentioned are all third party projects that have completely unrelated things. What users really want is a package that brings in all the bells and whistles necessary to utilize a convention-conforming protobuf service.\r\n\r\nBut it's ultimately your call whether to cargo culting the existing poor design or use the opportunity to fix it."
