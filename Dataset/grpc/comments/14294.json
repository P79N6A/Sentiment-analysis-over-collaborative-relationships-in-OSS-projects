I tried making the appropriate changes today, but I haven't been successful in getting to build them successfully using [`task_runner.py`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/tools/run_tests/task_runner.py).\r\n\r\nIt's internally using the Dockerfile [`grpc_artifact_python_manylinux_x64`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/tools/dockerfile/grpc_artifact_python_manylinux_x64/Dockerfile), but keeps failing at `RUN yum update -y` with:\r\n(EDIT: Added incorrect output before)\r\n```\r\nThe command '/bin/sh -c yum update -y returned a non-zero code: 139\r\n```\r\n\r\nAm I missing something?\r\n\r\nEDIT: The problem was Arch Linux specific. The Arch Kernel seems to have disabled _vsyscalls_ sometime back, which are required by certain programs in containers (such as apt-get). Enabled it and the above problem was fixed."
