    "body": "the 1.8.3 gem was just published. I believe that the relevant bug fix for ruby in that release is https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/13882\r\n\r\n> How are rubygems published?\r\n> I am assuming it is manual, could it be automated as part of a pipeline?\r\n\r\nPackage builds are automated but we still manually push the gems. I don't think there are any plans to change this since it's less error-prone if the decision to push a package is manual.\r\n\r\n> Is there a known delay between releasing and publishing to rubygems?\r\n\r\nThey should be available as soon as we publish them\r\n\r\n> Is there a release policy? (I couldn't find anything)\r\n\r\nIn general, we release a new minor version ~every 6 weeks, and this minor version release is done across all languages. Once the minor version is released, e.g., 1.8.0, there might be some bug fixes that will be applied on top of it and get published as patch releases. Where things might get a little weird is some bug fixes might only apply to e.g. one language, and in that case we increase the patch number for the whole repo, release the patch for that language, but then usually don't release the patch for other languages (so you can wind up with e.g., ruby-1.8.3 and c#-1.8.0). In this case, the 1.8.3 ruby package should have been released, but there was just a delay.\r\n\r\n"
