    "body": "Current update:\n\nI believe the cause is that we don't properly handle the case where the client disconnects at the same time the transport detects an error. The client_channel.c code handles GRPC_CHANNEL_DISCONNECT by sending down grpc_client_channel_destroy() and then synthesizing a GRPC_TRANSPORT_CLOSED message up the stack (which will ultimately release a refcount in channel.c, which will likely asynchronously destroy_channel()).\n\nMeanwhile, the transport layer detects an error and tries to report a GRPC_TRANSPORT_CLOSED, but the channel may have already gone away.\n"
