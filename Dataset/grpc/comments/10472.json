    "body": "If everything goes well, the plan is to push the 1.3 release on Apr 26.\r\n\r\nI should point out the `grpc_reflection` pip package depends on the `protobuf` package, which uses a different code base for its `manylinux` architecture vs. other architectures (the `manylinux` build uses a Python extension written in C++ whereas other architectures use a pure python implementation) and the pure python implementation has a bug that prevents `grpc_reflection` to work correctly, so please keep that in mind. The fix for that is coming in `protobuf` 3.3, but if you use the `manylinux` build of `protobuf` package or compile the C++ extension from source and install it, you should be fine using `grpc_reflection` even now. We have a skipped test in `_reflection_servicer_test.py` that manifests this `protobuf` bug if unskipped."
