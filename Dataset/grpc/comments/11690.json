    "body": "dbg+opt in parallel is only 1 hour right? Why can't we shard that?\n\nRegarding reducing the number of tests:\n1. which tests can we eliminate without reducing signal that something is\nbroken? (we should be able to determine that now, but it's actually a hard\nproblem that someone needs to spend some time on)\n2. failing that, we're already randomly sampling to keep tests within one\nhour (so your point 3 is kind of moot): how low can that number go without\nlosing signal? (again a research problem that we'll need to spend quite\nsome time on - I'd say reduce by 10%, wait a month, measure average failure\nrate, repeat)\nI'd posit that either of these are going to take more time from more folks\nthan simply sharding out on Jenkins\n\nRegardng running tests more efficiently:\n1. we currently try to bin-pack jobs such that there's enough cpu for their\naverage runtime - that's currently hand edited, and I see\njson_run_localhost variants requesting 1024 cores currently. Doing so will\nstarve out all other processes until they're done. We can either manually\nupdate that (although I've done it enough times that really... someone\nelses turn), or do similar to what we just did with the deflaking: perform\na bigquery to see average CPU usage for each test over the past XX days,\nand patch tests.json data as we're loading it with updated values.

    "body": "Ok, if you mean the total time from pushing a change (the bug doesn't say that and we been discussing the runtime of the tests themselves until now), there's currently 3 sources:\r\n1. Kokoro polling interval is currently 15mins because of github quota issues. This should change once kokoro switches to github webhook notifications (than the notifications should be basically instantaneous). Before that happens, we have no way of influencing this. ETA is end of sept.\r\n2. Wait time in the queue - not sure if the wait time in the queue is queryable, but from looking at last ~30 builds, the avg in peak hours seems to be ~20min. Is that what you are seeing? We can bump the max number of available Kokoro workers. I'll try to see if we can collect some metrics to get some success metric.\r\n3. The runtime of the tests themselves - who from C core team can help with that? I don't feel like I have enough cycles to handle that on my own."

E.g. in https://kokoro.corp.google.com/job/grpc/job/ubuntu/job/pull_request/job/grpc_basictests_c_cpp_dbg/ in the last 30 builds I don't see any infrastructure failure - all the red builds are actual flakes in our code. The right thing to do is fix them (btw, we enabled the autoflake flagging on kokoro recently so flakes we are seeing either have high percentage of failure or things are too random to reliably capture all of them on master so they get autoflagged). \r\n\r\nWith Jenkins we don't have a way to scale the number or workers easily and we are hoping we will be fully on kokoro in a month or so, so getting the latency down on Jenkins would be a lot of frustrating manual work with questionable effect.\r\n\r\nWe can discuss in more detail in the meeting."
