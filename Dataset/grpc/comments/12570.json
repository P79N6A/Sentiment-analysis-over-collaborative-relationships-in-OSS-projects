Or just not support this scenario, potentially. (Ultimately, the support for native libraries in NuGet packages leaves something to be desired, but we need to work around that as best we can.)"

    "body": "@sdg002: For most applications you shouldn't normally run into this problem (this issue is specific to ASP.NET Web Site projects), but there can be a transitive dependency issue. If you just add a direct reference to `Grpc.Core` in either of your projects, I'd expect that to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nIf it doesn't, could you create a new issue with a small example so I can reproduce it? Feel free to add that in the [google-cloud-dotnet](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-dotnet) repo or here - but if it's here please tag me (just include @jskeet in the description) so I can see be notified."
