    "body": "Yeah... I think the next big step is to put call_data.state under a per call mutex... It'll drastically reduce the number of server wide locks we need. \n\nAnd then it's on to the hard thing of providing some more concurrency for matching incoming and requested calls.\n\nI did think about putting those into lists with per call/request mutexes guarding the next pointers (so you'd need to crab walk across it)... Might be worth trying... Would decouple insertion from matching allowing each to proceed independently. Further segmenting by target completion queue still needs to be on the table.\n\nI don't think there's a lock free algorithm that covers all the cases that need to be handled here.\n\nThe right design is still unclear but I think we're moving towards it.\n"
