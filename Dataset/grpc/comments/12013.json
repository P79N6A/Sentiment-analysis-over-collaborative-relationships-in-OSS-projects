    "body": "@apolcyn , there are two reasons for not doing full source compilation \r\n\r\n1. When tried, it could not find openssl because debian already use openssl 1.1 whereas grpc still supports only openssl 1.0. \r\n\r\n2. The already built libgrpc.a or libgrpc.so (since both are available, .so is preferred) is patched to support openssl 1.1. So we really don't need to build it twice (debian already provides libgrpc C and C++ libraries, using them makes it easier to maintain, as we don't have to apply patches twice for example like adding support for openssl 1.1).\r\n\r\n3. In debian, we should build every binary from source code as per debian policy, so pre-built binary cannot be used.\r\n\r\nThe ruby version is also 1.3.2 since I want to use libgrpc.so built from 1.3.2.\r\n\r\nI managed to make it work with this patch https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-ruby-extras/ruby-grpc.git/tree/debian/patches/no-make-in-extconf.patch but it would be nice if it was supported with a conditional like ENV['EMBED_GRPC'] = 'false'. It also requires a change in LDFLAGS when building libgrpc.so (https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=867541#89)."
