    "body": "I think that tagging this issue is a bit of a red herring. Namely, I don't think we ever see a test run where the quit failure/timeout is the only problem. Rather, it always follows some other timeout/failure. Those timeouts and failures are concentrated on Node (for which there are other issues) or C++ with resource quotas (for which there are other issues posted). I think it's worth looking at this, but have we ever seen a quit failure as the only problem in a test? If so, what language?"
