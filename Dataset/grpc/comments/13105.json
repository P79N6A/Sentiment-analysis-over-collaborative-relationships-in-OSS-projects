We appreciate the pull request and should've given it attention when you created it.\r\n\r\nI tried to update BoringSSL back in September with #12700, but at that time, there were some conflicts that stopped us from proceding, which we brought up with BoringSSL. I just recently was able to update BoringSSL with #13948 and #14256, so I hope this resolves any issue you may have had. "
