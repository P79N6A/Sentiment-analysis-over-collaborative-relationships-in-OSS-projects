    "body": "@Disturbing Yeah, by \"locking\" I meant it more generally than the `lock` statement. I am most worried about the additional complexity.  Let me think about it a bit more, but I don't think a mere dictionary alone will cut it, since I care about order of interceptors being invoked. I think if we end up doing it, it will effectively look like that `MultiplexerInterceptor` I just described, but shipped in the `Grpc.Core` assembly. I'll focus on the core functionality in this PR; we can add that later."

    "body": "@JordyLangen There's value in consistency across implementations, and C# implementation is arguably more similar to Go, Ruby, and upcoming Python designs, leaving Java as the odd duck here. I think the differences in existing APIs are partially the cause for differences. I would say the updated C# server interceptors are more similar to Java style. On the client side, Java's implementation is very much tied to the `Channel`, whereas in C# we had the nice `CallInvoker` abstraction already existing. One design goal was to interfere in the core RPC machinery as little as possible, so as to (1) not potentially hinder the performance of the non-intercepted RPCs. (2) be able to short-circuit the whole thing. (I also think part of the root cause for some things can be traced back to differences in generics in C# and Java.)\r\nThis design (C#), basically gives control to the interceptor to do anything it wants right when a call is made. It is easy to build an interceptor on top of this that raises event notifications as headers get sent, messages get sent, etc. more similar to the Java ones."
