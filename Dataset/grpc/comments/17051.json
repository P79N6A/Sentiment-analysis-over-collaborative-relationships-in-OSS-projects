    "body": "Ok I finally managed to reproduce the bug using a Linux container and Mono. So it seems to only show up when running the test in Mono, and what is happening is that the `VerifyPeerHandler` callback is invoked by the managed code, but the object itself seem to have been garbage collected despite the `gcHandle` (probably the CLR forcibly collects it when shutting down), so a `NullReferenceException` is thrown when calling `this.gcHandle.Free()`.\r\n\r\nI think the issue can be solved in two ways:\r\n* Put a try catch around the `this.gcHandle.Free()` and just ignore if it throws an exception. I put this solution on a [separate branch](https://github.com/tlg-bf/grpc/tree/2-provide-access-to-client-certificate-quick-fix), and it looks like this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tlg-bf/grpc/blob/57acf5eabaf0cbcf6b0b21b10e22bb9b55c00669/src/csharp/Grpc.Core/ChannelCredentials.cs#L215-L231\r\n\r\n* Use a finalizer to make sure that the object is not disposed until the unmanaged code has invoked the callback with the `isDestroy` true. Relevant pieces of codes for [this branch](https://github.com/tlg-bf/grpc/tree/2-provide-access-to-client-certificate-finalize) are:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tlg-bf/grpc/blob/693da6ae8be81b415161fe41a017fcc76a32b393/src/csharp/Grpc.Core/ChannelCredentials.cs#L173-L183\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tlg-bf/grpc/blob/693da6ae8be81b415161fe41a017fcc76a32b393/src/csharp/Grpc.Core/ChannelCredentials.cs#L186-L196\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tlg-bf/grpc/blob/693da6ae8be81b415161fe41a017fcc76a32b393/src/csharp/Grpc.Core/ChannelCredentials.cs#L232-L239\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think is the best way or if you have a better solution."

At the same time, I'm hoping the newly added code would solve https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/18178 and https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/17587. Please stay tuned."

In the meantime, I was working on integration with NativeCallbackDispatcher myself. The resulting code is similar (I started off of your changes), but I did some extra cleanup and rewrote the tests (they weren't setup in a very readable way IMHO). Also your PR still has some bugs I believe. Let's review https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/18591 instead and close this PR as superseded. "
