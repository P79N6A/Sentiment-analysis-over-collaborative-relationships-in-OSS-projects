    "body": "@coryan   as I understand it, this is a problem when trying to link grpc/grpc++ statically (dynamic linking works as demonstrated by https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/test/distrib/cpp/run_distrib_test_routeguide.sh) - can you provide an example of such build? Ideally I'd like to set up a test so we don't run into this again."

    "body": "I created a little test that links things statically, you may need to adapt it to your needs. The [attached tarball](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/files/2290878/test.tar.gz) has a simple `Makefile`, and a `Dockerfile` to reproduce all the build steps.\r\n\r\nThere is some good news (maybe), the `libgrpc++.a` library seems to include the contents of the `libaddress_sorting.a` library. If that was intentional, then you would not need to add `libaddress_sorting` to any pkg-config files.\r\n\r\nDo not hesitate to contact me if you have more questions (I am a Googler btw, so you should be able to find me inside Google too).\r\n\r\n"
