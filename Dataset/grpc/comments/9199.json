    "body": "The application where I'm using a grpc stub was initially set up using the beta api, and we hadn't updated under the (I think mistaken?) belief that we'd also have to update the server which isn't under our control.  \r\n\r\nFrom some initial testing however, it looks like updating the client doesn't actually change the wire protocol, so I assume that means it's safe to switch to the stable client api without any server changes.  If that's the case, then I think this issue can be closed, since just doing `stub = SomeStub(channel)` produces a stub that has all its methods as instance attributes, which means the default `__dir__` implementation does the right thing."

Since you've done the work here... well it's not covered by tests... and it's in code that we want to die at _some_ point hopefully as soon as possible... but if you asked for this to be merged, I'd happily merge it.

    "body": "@nathanielmanistaatgoogle I'm fine with having better completion be a carrot for folks to migrate to more stable APIs.  Speaking of which, I ported over our grpc client code today to use the GA API.  It generally went swimmingly, but one issue I'm running into is that it looks like the exceptions raised by various RPC calls have changed?  Previously our retry/error handling code was catching and handling `AbortionError`, whereas now we seem to be seeing subclasses of `RpcError`.  I assume that's expected behavior?  Are there any other gotchas I should be aware of while upgrading?"
