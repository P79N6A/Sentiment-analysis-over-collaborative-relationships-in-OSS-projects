    "body": "I wanted to followup on this separately. The registration should not be automatic, IMO, because we don't know if this RPC will still be desired. I like to think of registration as establishing a credit system. For example, in the qps server, you'll see that there are 100 Requests made ahead of time for later use. More get added later because this server needs a lot, but that wouldn't always be the case.\n"
