    "body": "dlsym seems to be used to load either getenv or its secure version in [env_linux.c](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/core/lib/support/env_linux.c#L49). But This seems be done because the we can gracefully degrade the requirements in that case (secure_getenv to getenv). Note that directly beneath this is a glibc version check just like that. In this case, there are no gracefully degraded alternatives. We simply return 0. So I don't think it makes sense to dlsym sched_info when we have already implemented the version check that is also present in env_linux.c"

Is there any advantage to doing that that I'm missing?\r\n\r\n(I'm happy to make the changes if that's the direction we want to go in.  I'm just wondering if there's a reason that would make it worth supporting the extra complexity of doing that)"
