    "body": "If your pure C file can't find grpc.h, then something went wrong in the environment; either the grpc install didn't include the headers+libs for core or somehow your env-vars are otherwise broken.\n\nIn the absence of a working environment, you need to specify both include flags (`-I`) and linker directory flags (`-L`) for everything to build successfully. Try adding the lib directory for grpc as a linker directory flag.\n\nI promise that this will not be problem come next minor release. We'll be keeping the core and the Python package in lockstep from then on, and Mac OS will have wheels.\n\nIf you already have `enum34` and `futures` `pip install`ed, there's a [staged Mac OS wheel on TestPyPI](https://testpypi.python.org/pypi/grpcio/0.12.0b6) that we'd like to hear feedback on!\n"
