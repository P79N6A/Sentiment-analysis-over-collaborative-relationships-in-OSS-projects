    "body": "Interesting... I actually reimaged a Mac with the latest (Apple vanilla) macOS last night and am pretty sure I did not need to install `gflags` (to make the default target at least). I believe [we bundle it in `third_party`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/third_party). Did you have all the dependencies the first time you invoked `make`? Since I have encountered difficulties trying to run `make` after installing dependencies with `brew` if it had once failed before and had to restart from scratch. Did you have submodules initialized before running `make` for the first time?"

    "body": "Yes, that was the surprising part for me since we definitely have this as a submodule (though despite that we still require gflags to be apt-get in Linux, so there's that). I had submodules updated properly before running make. My exact sequence of instructions very closely followed the `INSTALL.md` file:\r\n\r\n1. git clone...\r\n2. xcode-select --install\r\n3. (get brew as instructed on brew.sh)\r\n4. brew install autoconf automake libtool shtool\r\n5. cd grpc\r\n6. git submodule update --init\r\n7. make buildtests\r\n[ Lots of failures looking for gflags/gflags.h ] \r\n8. brew install gflags\r\n9. make buildtests\r\n10. Profit!"

    "body": "Oh, I see, we're talking over each other. You're probably right about the default target. I was trying to build tests because the Linux instructions say \"If you plan to build from source and run tests, install the following as well\" . I guess we just need a separate category for that in Mac just as in Linux. I'll edit this PR accordingly. Indeed, all the `gflags/gflags.h` failures were for specific files in `test/cpp`\r\n"
