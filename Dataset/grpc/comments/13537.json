    "body": "Thanks for checking in. I can’t confirm if the issue is resolved because I haven’t tried it a little after opening this issue. I tried starting from scratch. I might have had faces this  because, earlier I was using the latest version of only the protobuf. Later we decided to use grpc on top of it to manage services. I started seeing this issue when I installed grpc after having a working protobuf already installed (the versions of grpc makefile and protobuf matched). After seeing these errors I removed everything, grpc as well as installed protobuf and reinstalled grpc from scratch along with protobuf shipped with grpc as described in grpc doc. I saw the same issue multiple times and finally gave up (moved on). \n\nI believe you can close this for now. \n\n> On May 15, 2018, at 7:43 PM, Yash Tibrewal <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> are you still seeing this?\n> \n> —\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n> \n"
