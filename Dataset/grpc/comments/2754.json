    "body": "@DavidPhillipOster : This is the first change I've got pending. My teammate Michael did a pass right before going on vacation.\n\nIt's made of the following commits. Going commit by commit is slower, but more manageable. The first 3 are just refactoring preparing for the 4th one, which is the interesting one. Clicking on their link will show each's diff:\n1. [Move `_channel` from `GRPCCall` into `GRPCWrappedCall`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/commit/3a5253eb129fa712f6962d0b8dc2b680b4e616c3): Refactoring. There's a 1:1 relationship between `GRPCCall` objects and `GRPCWrappedCall` objects; so this just encapsulates the `_channel` ivar.\n2. [Encapsulate `grpc_call` creation inside `GRPCChannel`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/commit/bd993df3f6eeaea7b032b272703c5fc41beeebef): (Suggest to start with [this file](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/commit/bd993df3f6eeaea7b032b272703c5fc41beeebef#diff-5ff587c4d9f035952ed750e7ef97d8cf).) We want the `host` passed to `grpc_channel_create_call` to be overriden on a per-channel basis (so that I can connect to a test server in localhost and have the Host header of my RPC be \"mytestserver\" instead of \"localhost\"). So this moves the `grpc_channel_create_call` into `GRPCChannel`, wherein that argument can be later overriden (the `GRPCSecureChannel` subclass will).\n3. [Remove `GRPCChannel-initWithHost` to simplify implementation](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/commit/148403af988522e61f4e71dc1bbd00b9f0d51a42): Refactoring. `GRPCChannel` is a class cluster. It has a convenience constructor that returns an object from a subclass (basically, secure or insecure channel). The constructor was doing that by allocating the base class and calling an initializer that then created and returned another object. This removes that unnecessary complexity.\n4. [Let register SSL config per-host](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/commit/e8543b071502fe0609d0c1657cfaf39d1a04c25d): This is the meat of this change. The commit has a detailed description, but the purpose is to let the user do something like this on their initialization:\n\n``` objective-c\n#import <GRPCClient/GRPCCall+Tests.h>\n...\nNSBundle *bundle = [NSBundle bundleForClass:self.class];\nNSString *certsPath = [bundle pathForResource:@\"TestCertificates.bundle/test-certificates\"\n                                       ofType:@\"pem\"];\n[GRPCCall useTestCertsPath:certsPath testName:@\"foo.test.google.fr\" forHost:kLocalSSLHost];\n```\n\nAnd from then on, all RPCs to that host will use SSL with the provided test parameters.\n\nFinally, there's these 4 trivial fixes: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/commit/000fa388b8d7c99601092976b5b1d93a9705e34d, https://github.com/grpc/grpc/commit/e21b467dc59b8d0ddc6f64bde65df07e121a0132, https://github.com/grpc/grpc/commit/56c6574652ce261370582fec7decd4a8e6ce1cb3, https://github.com/grpc/grpc/commit/7d261ee5b6bf69378787600971de0361d2c76081.\n"
