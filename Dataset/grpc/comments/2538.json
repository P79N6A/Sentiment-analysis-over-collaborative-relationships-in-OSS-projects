    "body": "> we should make sure we're not running the tests that hit the grpc-testing backend\n\nThat's totally what this script does. Just what we did manually before, only now automated. I agree that this is _not_ what we should do in Jenkins. For that we'll have to separate the interop tests into a different scheme. Until then, the script simplifies our manual testing.\n\n> some of the tests require a running local server, so we should either run that or skip those tests\n\nThe scheme is currently set to skip them, until we decide on a suitable server, adjust the tests accordingly (those tests were written for the route_guide server in grpc-common), and add the command to run the server.\n\nWe'll want a server that can do both cleartext and SSL, and #2429 fixed to test against the local SSL server.\n"
