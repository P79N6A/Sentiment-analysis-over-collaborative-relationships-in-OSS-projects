    "body": "Hi guys,\n\nas of PR #7313, if you write your proto-file podspecs [like this](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/objective-c/README.md#cocoapods) (or like in [this example app](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/examples/objective-c/helloworld/HelloWorld.podspec)), the versions of `protoc`, of the gRPC plugin, and of the gRPC runtime will always be resolved by Cocoapods to be compatible.\n\nSpecifically, the 0.15 branch lacked some of the fixes of the 0.14 branch for Objective-C, creating this mess. With the new way to use `protoc` via Cocoapods these things won't be a problem ever again.\n\nPlease give it a try, forget about 0.15 for Objective-C (our next release after 0.14 will be 1.0, which already had [its branch](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/v1.0.x) cut), and let me know if it works for you!\n"
