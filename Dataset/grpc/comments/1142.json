You need to fix that.\n\nBut the ~823 added files are definitely too much, and it looks quite bad:\n- it effectively duplicates all of the grpc header files and source code - src/objective-c/examples/Sample/Pods/gRPC/ is a full copy\n- it includes pre-compiled libraries - src/objective-c/examples/Sample/Pods/OpenSSL/lib\n- it includes files that we can't have in there for licensing reason, namely the OpenSSL header files in src/objective-c/examples/Sample/Pods/OpenSSL/opensslIncludes/openssl\n\nDoes the example _have_ to live in there ? Can't it go in grpc-common like all the other examples ? Distribution of the whole duplication of the source code nonwithstanding, that is. Or isn't there a way to acquire / generate these Cocoapods dependencies, akin to a `pip install` or a `gem install` ? Something that the endusers would run in order to generate that themselves.\n"

    "body": "End users _can_ generate the dependencies by running `pod install`. Even so, the recommended practice (and what I'd prefer) is to check in source control the generated files, because:\n- It makes builds possible even if/when some dependency's server, or the Cocoapods specs repo, becomes inaccessible.\n- It makes builds hermetic and hence always reproducible.\n- The (relatively fast) evolution of the cocoapods binary could otherwise break the build for users cloning this.\n- It's much better experience for users if a sample app works as is when cloned. Without the generated code checked in, the app doesn't build. If after that the user is still interested, he might Google the problem, and find on StackOverflow that (as our documentation tells) he needs to install Cocoapods before and run some command.\n- Not everybody will want to install Cocoapods.\n\nThe example can go on grpc-common, it doesn't need to be here. _Some_ app will need to be here for development and tests, though, so the problem won't go away with that.\n\nThe generated files aren't a perfect copy of the sources of the dependencies. For the C library, it modifies occurrences of `time.h` and `string.h` with `grpc_time.h` and `grpc_string.h` so the library can build. For OpenSSL, the generated files are the headers and precompiled binaries (which a lot of people put into source control because compiling it takes ages).\n\nWhat specifically prevents us from including the OpenSSL headers in this repo? Among the generated files is a copy of their license, FWIW.\n"

    "body": "I'm not convinced a midway solution would help more than hinder. I also want to understand what we are trying to _prevent_ by not checking in these generated files. So far we have:\n1. The automatically modified (not duplicated) gRPC core would deviate over time and would need to be regenerated constantly.\n2. X number of auto-generated files are too many.\n3. Checking in precompiled binaries is bad.\n4. OpenSSL's license doesn't let us copy its headers here.\n\nThe first one is fine with me, and the others I don't understand yet:\n1. They are regenerated if necessary when I do `pod install` to test changes in the Objective-C code, which already is constantly.\n2. What's this limit?\n3. Not only it's common practice to have a precompiled OpenSSL checked in, we want to distribute the whole Objective-C library as a framework for people that don't use Cocoapods. A framework is just a specially-organized folder with the headers and precompiled binaries (including dependencies) inside. What's the reason _not_ to check in a precompiled binary? Repo size?\n4. Obviously IANAL, but I would expect us to be able to distribute it along with its license.\n\nWhen we agree to the downsides of checking the files in, then we can balance them with the downsides of not checking them in:\n1. Building this would depend on the OpenSSL and RubyGems servers being always reachable, making tests unnecessarily flaky.\n2. Builds wouldn't be hermetic, but I don't think this will be a problem for the moment.\n3. Recompiling the same OpenSSL unnecessarily adds XX minutes to start working on each new branch, and would add them to each run of Travis tests. It kills the development workflow (for me and anyone who would want to contribute).\n4. It presents users with an app that's broken. But we can add big red warnings that point users to an example in grpc-common that has the generated files checked in, and that point developers to instructions to install and run Cocoapods.\n\nWe can decide to live with 1 and 2. I don't think we can afford 4 until we have more than zero users. And 3 is why this might hinder more than help.\n"

    "body": "1. The main difference between the currently generated files, and the one you are proposing, is that we only have to regenerate the project files when people add or remove files to the project. We don't need to regenerate them for every single change in the project. Regenerating the examples on every commit to keep everything in sync would be excessive, and the alternative is to allow drifting, which is unacceptable. See #1124 by the way, which aims at adding a test against drifting for the currently generated files.\n2. We don't have an actual number for the limit we're imposing. The only limit we have is \"reasonable\" - meaning that we'll only accept a reasonable amount of generated files in there. Every single file of grpc C core being duplicated is not a reasonable amount in my opinion.\n3. I really, really don't want to have OpenSSL embedded in the project. I don't really care about what other projects are doing on that matter, but this won't be acceptable here. Several reasons:\n   - This is a security maintenance and responsibility burden. We don't want that burden.\n   - This would mean gRPC becomes a project that explicitly contains cryptography code. Under US laws, that isn't exportable outside US to certain countries, and we have to put a legal disclaimer for that. We don't want that.\n   - The OpenSSL license means if we distribute it, we have to change our own license to include the disclaimer that we are shipping with OpenSSL. \n\nThat said, we are currently building OpenSSL regularly when doing our own tests. In fact, Travis currently does build OpenSSL 8 times for doing the tests, for every pull request, and every commit we're merging. We're also giving a batch script for the Windows users to build their own OpenSSL easily out of the third_party folder. But we still don't distribute OpenSSL ourselves.\n\nAll of that being said, I have absolutely no objection in switching to Bazel - in fact, I would be in favor of that.\n"
