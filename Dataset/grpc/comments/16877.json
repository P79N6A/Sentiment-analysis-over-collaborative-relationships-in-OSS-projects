    "body": "This is a missing comment in our API. ClientContext must be alive for the duration of the RPC, not just for starting the RPC. The reason is that any trailing metadata from the server are delivered to the ClientContext when the RPC gets it status. So, this behavior is expected, but we should document the fact that ClientContext must continue to exist for the duration of the RPC."
