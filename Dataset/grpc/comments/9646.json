Although note that we will still have some subsequent work to do to get the c-ares resolver working on Windows and libuv."

    "body": "I'm not quite clear on which two callbacks are racing each other here.  I gather from the original description that one of them was `on_lb_policy_state_changed()`, although I don't know which other one was the issue.\r\n\r\nHowever, since this issue was filed, the client_channel code has been changed to use a combiner lock, and `on_lb_policy_state_changed()` is now running in the combiner (renamed to `on_lb_policy_state_changed_locked()`).  Given that, is there still a race here, or has this been fixed?"
