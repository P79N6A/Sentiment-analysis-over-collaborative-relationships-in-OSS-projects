    "body": "My 2Â¢: it isn't really a 'poller', though, from the user code perspective. One polls it rather than it doing any polling. What we're popping off the queue are events (and not necessarily completion events, either - they're events associated with just about every GRPC core structure). I believe the name should reflect the direction of action between the user code and the API, and would thus prefer that at least `queue` somehow be kept in the name with the `completion_` part perhaps changing to something more general.\n"
