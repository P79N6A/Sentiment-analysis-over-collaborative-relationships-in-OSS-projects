    "body": "As I mentioned offline, I suggest taking a look at the relevant internal Google classes this design is based on: the names you're looking for are ServerStatusImpl and ServerStatusDescriptorDatabase.\n\nThere are two problems with returning proto-ified descriptors, rather than FileDescriptorProtos. Firstly there's no API to consume this information right now. (I'll happily consider a new design if this changes!) The second problem is that it requires too many round trips -- in practice any such API is going to need to make a bunch of blocking RPCs as it parses each piece of a proto.\n"
