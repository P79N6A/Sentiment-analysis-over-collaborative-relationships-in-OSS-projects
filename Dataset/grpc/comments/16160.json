    "body": "Can you clarify the following  ?\r\n>By the time delete is called on the object. I have shut down the stream with Finish( or the client context with TryCancel() and completion queue with Shutdown()\r\n\r\nI am assuming you finished the bidi stream (from client side) by calling `Finish()`,  called `Shutdown()` on the completion queue and `TryCancel()` on the `ClientContext` object . Is that correct?\r\n\r\n- Did the `ClientAsyncReaderWriter::Finish(Status* status, void *tag)` operation complete ? (i.e did the `tag` you passed return out of the completion queue? also, what is the returned `status` value ?) . \r\n- After you called `CompletionQueue::Shutdown()`, did you wait until `CompletionQueue::Next()` returned `false`? (to make sure that the queue was actually shutdown?)\r\n- Approximately how many seconds is it taking for the `ClientContext` destruction to fully complete?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI do agree that It is a bit strange that it is taking several seconds but from the traces you posted, it seems like this is also calling `grpc_shutdown` (i.e you no longer have any active grpc calls or channels open. Hence the grpc library is 'shutting down') and this can sometimes take a few seconds to do a clean-shutdown.\r\n\r\nIn addition to doing `export GRPC_VERBOSITY=DEBUG`, if you also turn on tracing as mentioned [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/environment_variables.md)  \r\nPerhaps `export GRPC_TRACE=all,-tcp`  (all traces except `tcp` which tend to be very verbose)\r\n"
