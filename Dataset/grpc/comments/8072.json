    "body": "As for showing more info in what's returned to the client, thinking we could fill in the \"details\" of the status just with the \"message\" contents of the ruby exception that's thrown in the callback. I'm guessing we wouldn't want the full backtrace too, though it looks like that's also an option.\n\nFor the status code that gets returned when an exception is thrown by the callback, it looks to me like the issue is knowing whether it was thrown for permissions reasons by the callback. \n\nIn case it is a real permissions error though, I think we still would want to return a status indicating that? It would change the API, but maybe we could change the default exception to unavailable, but do something like check the exception type thrown in the callback, and use the status code from that if it's a `BadStatus` exception, for example.\n"
