    "body": "Overall, the new RPCs and related changes look good, but I do have a question. This applies to the pre-existing setup as well. Is there anything in place to prevent a worker from servicing more than 1 of its important RPC classes simultaneously? For example, in the C++ code there is a lock protecting each of the methods in WorkerServiceImpl so that you can only do 1 of RunClient, RunServer, or QuitWorker at any time (CoreCount can be done without the lock). I didn't see anything equivalent in the C# but maybe I'm wrong? It would be helpful to make sure that we don't accidentally fire off 2 sets of work at the same worker, or quit while it's still trying to operate.\n"
