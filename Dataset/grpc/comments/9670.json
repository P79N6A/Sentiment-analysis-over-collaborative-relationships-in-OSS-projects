    "body": "So I'm not doing any explicit closing of channels at all, I'm just creating clients using the `<ClientType>.Create()` static members.  In my application, when I saw this behavior, I had created a single PublisherClient and a single SubscriberClient from the 1.0.0-beta006 and onwards versions of the Google.Cloud.PubSub.V1 nuget packages, which as I understand it creates a single GRPC channel for each of those clients.  These clients were then passed as parameters to functions that would run potentially concurrently sending and receiving messages.  The problem always seemed to be on the Subscriber Client after one successful message receipt."
