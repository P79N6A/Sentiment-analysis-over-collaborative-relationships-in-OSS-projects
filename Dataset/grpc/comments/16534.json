It makes sense (IMO) to have ownership for tools like Dockerfile where a problem would break our ability to test changes. It doesn't make sense to have ownership for things that are testable.

The goal of code ownership is actually to make sure that all changes are reviewed by someone who (a) has a good understanding of the code being changed and (b) is directly responsible for the code functioning properly.  That's why we have code owners for every directory internally; if test coverage were enough to avoid that, then we wouldn't need owners.\r\n\r\nI understand that you're not picking on this directory specifically, but as the primary owner of this component, I feel strongly that all changes should be reviewed by one of the people who is responsible for the code.  We generally review simple cleanup changes fairly quickly, and I don't think avoiding minor delays on those changes is worth the risk of not requiring a knowledgeable reviewer on more complex changes."

    "body": "One last argument before I put this one to bed, and I speculate that recognition of this argument is why one co-owner approved this PR. The analogy given above to internal owners is flawed; a key difference between Github owners and internal owners is that internally, an owner can assign a review to anybody but a non-owner must assign a review to an owner. In Github, an owner must do the review regardless of whether an owner or non-owner wrote the code. Most contributions (in any world) are by owners, so the effect of having subowners on this directory is making sure that this part of the code is only written and reviewed by owners. This defeats the earlier request by @a11r that reviews should be spread throughout the team so as to avoid bus-factor problems and ease ramp-up. (Yes, you can technically assign multiple reviewers to the same PR, but the reality is that \"there isn't anybody who has time for that.\")"

Just because an owner has approved doesn't mean that they've actually done the detailed code review.\r\n\r\nI agree that it's a misfeature of github that requires another owner to approve when the PR author is an owner.  But that actually doesn't affect anyone but those of us who are owners, and we're willing to deal with it.\r\n\r\nI have actually had cases where I've sent out a PR for the client_channel code where I've marked a non-owner as a reviewer.
