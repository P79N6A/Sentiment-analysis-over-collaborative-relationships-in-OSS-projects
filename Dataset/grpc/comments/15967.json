    "body": "Sorry for the wait on this. As you've described the server-side interceptors indeed do not appear to follow the examples in the [initial proposal](As you've described the server-side interceptors indeed do not appear to follow the guidelin). But with another look, I think that the one problem with the server-side interceptor API that you're pointing out here is slightly beyond request/response calls? If fixing request/response calls to have access to the \"response\", it would also make sense to fix the three other types of RPC handlers: \"client streaming\", \"server streaming\", and \"bidi streaming\". \r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, what's your intended use of being able to access the \"response\" in server interceptors? Note that the response is not mutable at that point, because after an interceptor yields, the call has been effectively finished and terminated, complete with a status having already been sent (looks like another problem with the gRFC examples is that those examples appear to make the response object look mutable)."
