I am pretty certain that the Ruby unconstrained QPS=0 is because of choking under the current values of wide and deep - we can always get that in later. Thanks for putting that comment in on the Ruby line. Are there equivalent comments for the other TODO lines that explain the current problems with them? Or perhaps you could just mention it in reply to this comment. I am ok with merging this as is as long as there's some kind of explanation about what's currently not working with the TODO scenarios.\n"
