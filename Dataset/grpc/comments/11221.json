That would sacrifice some code reuse (but the generator is rather small), but the separation would be better and the flatbuffers plugin could be supported as part of grpc-ecosystem (we're moving the grift support there), rather than being part of grpc repository itself (where it doesn't really belong).\r\nBtw, code generators for other serialization formats are not necessarily written in C++, so the reuse of such refactoring seems to be limited."
