    "body": "<cc/ @jtattermusch who is most familiar with this code>\n\n@ctiller , unfortunately looks like this still didn't fix the issue. I noticed that the new field is inside 'clientStats' column group (i.e which is a column in the \"middle of the schema\") and as per the documentation here: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tables#updateschema, new columns can only be added at the end of the table.\n\nFor now to unblock the tests, I suggest you delete the key i.e `del stats['requestResults']` inside the loop at: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/tools/run_tests/performance/bq_upload_result.py#L119\nWe will figure out a way to add these to the schema later.\n"
