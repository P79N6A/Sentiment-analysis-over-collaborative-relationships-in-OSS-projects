    "body": "This isn't actually related to pick_first; the same problem would exist with round_robin.  I think the right place to fix this is in the sockaddr resolver, which can use `grpc_lb_targets_info_create_channel_arg()` to add a target map to the channel args it returns.  (We should probably also rename `grpc_lb_targets_info_create_channel_arg()` and `grpc_lb_targets_info_find_in_args()`, since they will no longer be specific to grpclb.)\r\n\r\nI think that using an IP address instead of a hostname in the SSL certificate is a bit of an odd setup, so I doubt this is affecting too many people.  As such, I'm not sure how quickly we'll get to this, but I'd be happy to review a pull request if you want to take a stab at fixing it."

Usually we use an IP list to configure the client.\r\nAlthough it is possible to create a DNS name for the cluster, it is usually not as reliable as the fixed IP list, and our DNS system depends on the etcd cluster.\r\nCurrently we are overriding the SSL target name for a workaround. I will try to fix it if I have time, but not now."
