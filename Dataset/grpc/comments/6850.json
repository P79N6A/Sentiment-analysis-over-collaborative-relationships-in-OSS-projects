    "body": "I was able to build gRPC on Alpine using `edge`, which has musl libc 1.15.0 implementing `sched_getcpu`.\n\nThe following patches to gRPC were needed, though:\n- `src/core/lib/support/wrap_memcpy.c` assumes glibc for wrapping `memcpy`. Since this appears to be a legacy fix for old glibc versions, slapping a `#if defined(__GLIBC__) ... #endif` around the entire thing will solve the issue when building with musl libc.\n- `src/core/lib/iomgr/tcp_posix.c` assumes `msg_iovlen_type` should be `size_t`, but `msghdr::msg_iovlen` is `int` in `/usr/include/bits/socket.h` for musl libc.  For an x86_64 build, this results in truncation warnings (turned into errors) from `size_t` to `int`.  A proper fix to set `GPR_MSG_IOVLEN_TYPE` to `int` for Alpine is needed in `include/grpc/impl/codegen/port_platform.h`.\n\nWhile it now builds, I haven't yet tested the resulting executables.\n"
