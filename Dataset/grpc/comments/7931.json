    "body": "More on allowing the option to swap out HTTP/2: Maybe you have clients like IoT devices with high packet loss and/or latency that HTTP/2 (or rather the TCP it runs on) won't handle well. There are protocols designed to handle this with preemptive retransmission, for one. Also, you need in-order messages for gRPC streaming methods but not for regular method calls, so using TCP for everything introduces unnecessary slowdowns when high packet loss is involved. "
