    "body": "All the autosharding use cases that Slicer is already used for, but the one we care about is loading multiple models in Tensorflow serving (we brought this up with TPU, TF and GCP team members already). Precomputing all the shards, let alone updating how they are spread across physical GPUs/TPUs based on live traffic patterns is a lot of work. And you end up reinventing Slicer or something equivalent to it."
