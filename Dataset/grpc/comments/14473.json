    "body": "The bug was introduced in the PR to convert the LB policy API to C++, but it was only tangentially related to C++.  Prior to that PR, the code used to basically do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Step 1: Create a new LB policy if needed.\r\ngrpc_lb_policy* new_lb_policy = nullptr;\r\nif (chand->resolver_result != nullptr) {\r\n  // ...\r\n  new_lb_policy = grpc_lb_policy_create(...);\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n// Step 2: Update chand->lb_policy.\r\nchand->lb_policy = new_lb_policy;\r\n// Step 3: Check whether new LB policy needs to be initialized.\r\nif (new_lb_policy != nullptr) {\r\n  // ...initialize chand->lb_policy...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I convered this code to C++, `new_lb_policy` changed from a simple pointer to an `OrphanablePtr<>`.  This meant that when its value was moved into `chand->lb_policy` in step 2, `new_lb_policy` became null, which meant that I could no longer check whether it was null in step 3.\r\n\r\nTo work around this, I added a boolean `lb_policy_created` variable and set it to true when we created a new LB policy.  But I forgot that in the original code, `new_lb_policy` could have been null because either we updated an existing LB policy or because we failed to create the new LB policy.  I was setting `lb_policy_created` to true in a place that caught the first case but not the second case."
