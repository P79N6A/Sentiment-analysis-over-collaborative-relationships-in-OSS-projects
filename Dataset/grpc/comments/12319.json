    "body": "Some update from my experiment:\r\nI tried adhoc test with the latest commit, a commit on 8/21 and a commit on 8/17, all QPS numbers are close to what the dashboard shows in the last couple of days, i.e. between 1M and 1.4M qps. \r\nThat means I didn't repro the higher qps before 8/19 (around 2M qps) or the sharp drop between 8/19 and 8/22 (<1M).\r\n\r\nNote even the released branch is showing similar pattern: dropping from stable >4M qps to churns between 3M to 4M qps.\r\nBy the way 8core tests also started to show large curves."
