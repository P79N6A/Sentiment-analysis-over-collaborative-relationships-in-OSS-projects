    "body": "It's not clear to me that it necessarily makes more sense to unconditionally use `https_proxy` instead of `http_proxy`, since gRPC can be used both with and without SSL.  I suppose that we could choose between the two based on whether the channel is a secure or insecure channel.  However, even that would not necessarily be accurate, since you can use a secure channel with mechanisms other than SSL.\r\n\r\nAll of this having been said, the nice thing about #9557 is that it moves the code that looks at this environment variable into a proxy mapper, so users can easily replace it with their own implementations that look at different environment variables.  Unless we can come up with a clear \"right answer\" for this behavior, that might be the best we can do."

    "body": "Java and Go behavior is to use the equivalent of https_proxy unconditionally. I suggest doing the same (although the fallback to http_proxy may be fine; it'd be good not to do that long-term, though).\r\n\r\nThe reasoning is a bit complicated. http_proxy should never use CONNECT; it should send the actual HTTP request to the proxy. https_proxy should always use CONNECT. Grpc should use https_proxy for encrypted connections. Period. There should be no debate (other than the fact this issue has been ignored for well over a year and so have now trained users to \"do it wrong\").\r\n\r\nSince grpc always uses CONNECT, even for insecure, things get a bit weird. http_proxy should always be plaintext and https_proxy should always be encrypted. Some http_proxies may not support CONNECT and some https_proxies may _require_ port 443 or a TLS handshake. Since we always use CONNECT, even for insecure, we likely can't make _everyone_ happy in the insecure case.\r\n\r\nA lot of proxies require additional configuration to support CONNECT and to limit to 443. Anyone that complains about our choice would probably still be upset if we used http_proxy because we don't supporting standard HTTP/1 plaintext proxying (and thus their proxy isn't smart enough to inspect the traffic). So overall https_proxy seems the better bet."

    "body": "> we can use CONNECT for insecure connections\r\n\r\nIt's possible, but some proxies will prevent doing so. It's a \"I configured my proxy in a specific way\" sort of thing, but it is normal and necessary for CONNECT to be limited to only certain destination ports. In RFC 7231:\r\n\r\n> There are significant risks in establishing a tunnel to arbitrary\r\n   servers, particularly when the destination is a well-known or\r\n   reserved TCP port that is not intended for Web traffic.  For example,\r\n   a CONNECT to a request-target of \"example.com:25\" would suggest that\r\n   the proxy connect to the reserved port for SMTP traffic; if allowed,\r\n   that could trick the proxy into relaying spam email.  Proxies that\r\n   support CONNECT SHOULD restrict its use to a limited set of known\r\n   ports or a configurable whitelist of safe request targets."
