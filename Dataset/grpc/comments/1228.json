You mentioned that you can build under FreeBSD - are you able to run the tests also, using the commands specified in the contributions guide? Were any changes needed on the C++ side? We currently do not have FreeBSD as a supported platform, but there is potentially interest and some experience on this platform from the group. We're very glad to accept external contributions, of course!\n"
