    "body": "The PHP Pear problem was resolved. We are able to build and push our PHP docker images now.\r\n\r\nWe finally reached a state where all tests passed. The next set of potentials things we can do to make this better are:\r\n\r\n - Add (back) more tests to `MemoryLeakTest.php`\r\n   - Within this, we don't need a lot of the tests found under the `unit_tests` directory.\r\n   - In particular, we don't need some of those \"constructor takes 2 parameter, let's pass it 0 parameter to see if it errors out\" type of tests. We are only interested in exercising as much code as possible to check for memory leaks.\r\n   - But we still should cover all the `Grpc\\*` classes introduced in the `grpc` extension\r\n   - In particular, there may be memory leaks associated with the `Server->requestCall` function\r\n - Add the tests to the PHP5 base docker image\r\n   - There seems to be still some error if we run this the php5 base docker images.\r\n   - But on the other hand, PHP5 is being phased out so this is less priority\r\n\r\nWe can do the above with new set of PRs\r\n\r\nWe have pushed the relevant `tools/dockerfile/test` docker images to docker hub `grpctesting` org."
