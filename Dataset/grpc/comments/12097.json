    "body": "I think the current documentation is correct (=reflects the current state of build support on Windows), but according to numerous issues, users are still having trouble building gRPC library on Windows (as a part of their project). We'll try to look into this by revisiting our cmake build (hopefully in Q1 2018).\r\nFor now, I'll close this issue as there's not much that can be added here."
