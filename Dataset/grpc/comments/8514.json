It doesn't always happen, and when it does its only in the context of our gitlab test machine, and only after running 20 minutes of python tests... tests that, for obvious reasons, I can't share the source code for here. Suffice it to say, it's a python application with a dozens of dependencies, and a convoluted build process. \n\nI'm attempting to find a smaller example that might reproduce the issue. (though this is probably the kind of bug where finding a way to reproduce it consistently points directly to the solution)\n\nWe are using gRPC version 1.0.0. I tried upgrading to 1.0.1rc1, and that seems to have helped, but other engineers are telling me it still occasionally fails with the segfault. It's some sort of race condition on shutdown.\n\nI realize this is not helpful; I put it up here in the hopes that it might be obvious what was wrong, or perhaps someone else had an easier reproduction. Feel free to close the issue if its not actionable in its current state, and I will open a new one if I can figure out something more concrete.\n"

Needless to say, please reopen if the issue resurfaces. \n\nBy the way, for future reference, you can get more logging by having the `GRPC_VERBOSITY` environment variable set to `DEBUG` prior to running your binary. There's also a collection of \"tracers\" for different part of the Core you may want to enable, even though it's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem knowing which ones to enable. For maximum log spam action, you can set the `GRPC_TRACE` environment variable to `all`. See https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/1a62ec83b7af9c4437164d10fa23197c64542382/doc/environment_variables.md for more details.\n"
