    "body": "There's actually one more place where one could argue \"Async\" suffix to be added - the AsyncClientStreamingCall (the type you get when you invoke streaming request - unary response call) is also awaitable and therefore the method name could be suffixed with Async. For AsyncUnaryCall, the methods name is already suffixed with \"Async\".\n\nBtw, are you actually invoking the methods in FooServiceBase (the server side base class) in your code? It sounds like because it's consumed by gRPC itself, you shouldn't need to.\n\nIn general, I don't disagree with making the change but taking into account it's a rather cosmetic change I don't think it's worth the trouble doing it now when version 1.0 has been released (E.g. this would break all the nugets that contain generated sources, and there are some).\nIF at some point we need to break the compatibility of generated code for some more significant reason, we could consider sneaking in the change you are suggesting, but right now I think it's way too much overhead associated with making this change with little benefits.\n"

I agree that it's a cosmetic change, and isn't worth the pain in changing right now.\n\nI'm not sure if this issue is the right place to make this comment, but I've been pleasantly surprised with how easy integrating with the core library was.\n\nI've since written an alternative grpc protoc plugin that adds retries, structured logging, and dual protobuf+msgpack serialization, in addition to the `GetGreetingAsync` server modification I spoke of earlier.\n\nThank you for making Grpc.Core easy to integrate with! It was quite simple to get the whole thing running, and didn't take very much code! Wanted to let you know that I very much appreciate the library design.\n"
