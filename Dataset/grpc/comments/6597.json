As per usual: what am I missing? And if I'm not missing anything, what's the defect in `cygrpc`? Is the test the simplest possible expression of \"RPC is active, server-side application is taking a really really long time to decide what initial metadata to send for the RPC, while it is taking that time the server operator decides to shut down the server in a hurry\"? If so, is this a scenario that is tested in other languages or in the Core's tests?\n"
