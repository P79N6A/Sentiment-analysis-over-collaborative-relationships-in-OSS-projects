    "body": "You could try a Node variant of the same workaround mentioned in that other issue. The Client constructor in the Node library accepts channel arguments as its third argument, so you may have some luck with something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclient = new Client(address, credentials, {\"grpc.initial_reconnect_backoff_ms\": 10000});\r\n```"
