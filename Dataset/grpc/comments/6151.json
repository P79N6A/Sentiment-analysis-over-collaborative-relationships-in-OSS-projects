    "body": "The main \"getting started\" guide is the best to follow: http://www.grpc.io/docs/ \n\nIt has tabs that show the instructions & code for each specific language and does a great job of walking through all the major details. The current \"basics\" tutorials are largely redundant and perhaps better if removed. Tutorials are better suited for showing specific examples or more advanced topics.\n\nThere's also a [short installation page](http://www.grpc.io/docs/installation/csharp.html) for each language but they've been removed from the sidebar. I believe that section is being redone to point to the example folders in the main grpc project.\n\nRegarding (4), you need to make sure `Grpc.Tools` is installed via Nuget to download the protobuf and grpc compilers.\n"

I am reasonably sure that things actually work (it looks like you're stuck with too old version of grpc.native.csharp for some reason). If the problem persists, please file a separate issue.\n"
