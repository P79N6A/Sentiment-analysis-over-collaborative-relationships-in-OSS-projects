    "body": "Well, yes, if you have an older version of protobuf installed on your system and it's major version is 3.0.0-X or anything higher, makefile will pick it up and it's really hard to autodetect which version is acceptable / which is not anymore.\n\nThe way to avoid this is to never `make install` protobuf on the machine where you are developing/building gRPC. (actually, make install is problematic thing in general as there is no easy way to uninstall once a new version of protobuf in released - which is at least several times a year).\n\nNo action planned here.\n"
