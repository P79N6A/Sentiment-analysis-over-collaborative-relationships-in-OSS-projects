For example, something like this one https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/9593, there is one complete code example that tells you everything you need to set up SSL/TLS channels from scratch: the server side, the client side, and even the cert part. I wonder if you have something similar but only with SSL/TLS authentication replaced with token authentication."
