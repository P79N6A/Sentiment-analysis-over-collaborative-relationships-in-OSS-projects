    "body": "@ctiller, #6207 was making Jenkins flaky for days, @makdharma reproduced it locally by running the tests repeatedly and got the traces you asked for, which he attached to that issue.\n\nFor this bug, reproducing is a bit involved, but also doable: We have to run the faulty server and make RPCs with the version of the client @pranay had. Done that way, there's no flakiness; every RPC failed like #6027 and made the client crash immediately after that. I asked him to get traces for `\"api\"` and `\"tcp\"`, which he attached. Next time I know I'll better ask for `\"all\"`.\n"
