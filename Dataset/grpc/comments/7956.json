Each network is different, firewalling rules within the network may apply for some ports and not others.\n\nIf a simple netcat on port 50051 doesn't work for you, this clearly indicates that this isn't a grpc-related issue. Try probing which ports are available for you to use using the same methodology, then change your example to use usable ports instead.\n"

    "body": "I don't believe this would be appropriate. This is way too specific of a feature to provide, for such a low level library that gRPC is. Each operating system is going to have a different mechanism, and potentially each machine even might have different permission sets that would make such heuristic not work. Providing something so specific wouldn't be a good developer experience, because what may magically work on one system would fail on another.\n\nMy response would be that this ought to be the responsibility of the API caller to check for such limitation, and call our API accordingly.\n\nI will close this issue as you've solved it on your end. If you want to continue the discussion on the topic of port heuristic, feel free to open a new one dedicated to that purpose.\n"
