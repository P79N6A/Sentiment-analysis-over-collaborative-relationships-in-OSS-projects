    "body": "I suspect we actually don't need project for grpc_shared and gpr_shared. I introduced these a while ago, but then I made grpc_csharp_ext depend on static versions of grpc and gpr. So grpc.dll and gpr.dll are unused (and the way they are generated for VS 2013 is kind of hackish)\n\nAlso, I was wondering if we should use cmake to generate VS solutions in the future. It seems that it should be able to generate project files for multiple versions of VS as well as nmake makefiles. \n"
