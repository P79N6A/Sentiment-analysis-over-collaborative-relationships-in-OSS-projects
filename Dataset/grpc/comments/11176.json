    "body": "The semantic of the argument probably mutated without the associated documentation update, thanks for bringing that up. Since proto_library had issues with Bazel we had to change this around, indeed. Our goal eventually became to provide a replacement of proto_library, waiting for proper Bazel support.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, you should be able to use `grpc_proto_library` instead, and we should make sure this rule stays the same moving forward. It's supposed to be used as a replacement of `proto_library` and provides both the generation of the .pb.{cc,h} and .grpc.pb.{cc,h} files. You can see an example of that at the root of the example folder."
