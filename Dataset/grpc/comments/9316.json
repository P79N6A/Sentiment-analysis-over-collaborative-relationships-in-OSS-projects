If there was some sort of reward bounty for completing this project, I can move it up my priority queue.\r\n\r\n@GitStonic, if you are looking to do load balancing. You should be deploying multiple gRPC nodes via something like Kuburnetes and then creating upstreams via NGINX or your load balancer of choice."
