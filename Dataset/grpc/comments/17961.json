Maybe this should rather be two separate tickets, though topics are highly coupled to each other. In the end, the following questions should be answered:\r\n\r\n- How can I port gRPC to a different platform?\r\n   a) Given my platform partly supports POSIX, which APIs are needed for gRPC?\r\n   b) Given my platform does not support POSIX, which functionality does the platform have to provide and how can I adapt gRPC accordingly?\r\n- How can I port gRPC to a different compiler, e.g. IAR ARM, in order to be able to cross compile with that compiler?\r\n\r\nHoping I could further clarify the topic with these additional questions. And if gRPC does not intend to ever support truly embedded platforms and related compilers, that's OK, just clearly state that at a location where people find the information."
