As a matter of feedback, making it resettable would be ideal (at least with the precondition that the previous tag had been drained) and seems feasible looking at the code, as it makes for a better API from a usability perspective (right now I have to wrap it with `std::unique_ptr` and recreate the instance every time, but `Alarm` recreates `grpc_timer` each time anyway so it could just make it work for us.)"
