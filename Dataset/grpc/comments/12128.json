    "body": "@jskeet I think writing to a console by default is a reasonable default behavior and it seems to make first steps with gRPC easier - as a new user, I'd prefer the application to tell me about issues with my setup (e.g. failure to connect to a server, dns resolution problem and others that seem pretty common when trying to run your gRPC application for the application) rather than staying silent and me needing to discover somewhat hidden logging options to actually see some useful info to debug.\r\nThe reverse process seems much more straightforward: I have an application -> it prints stuff that I don't like -> I look for gRPC Logging configuration -> I easily discover the setting and use GrpcEnvironment.SetLogger(NullLogger()) to silence the logs.\r\n\r\nA bit more philosophically, it depends if one perceives gRPC as a library (logging by default might be questionable) or as a framework (in which case logging to the console seems reasonable - all application servers I know about do that)."

    "body": "I definitely see gRPC as a library more than a framework. It's *one part* of how I get my job done, not a decision that dictates everything I do - it's a leaf node more than a root, so to speak, and it's also something that might be brought in without me being particularly aware of it.\r\n\r\nWhile I agree that writing to the console is friendly in some cases, it's definitely unfriendly in others - and in the \"new user\" cases, I'd expect those failures to be shown in exceptions anyway. If the user wants more detail on what's causing those failures, they can opt into it just as easily as your proposed opting out.\r\n\r\nThe fact that this would be a change of behavior makes this a lot more damaging though - suppose you have an application which depends on a library which uses Grpc.Core 1.4, and it works fine despite some connectivity issues, because the library is handling all the exceptions. You then take a dependency on a second library which uses Grpc.Core 1.6, so the whole *system* uses Grpc.Core 1.6. The new library may not be triggering any warnings in its own right - it may be talking to a server that doesn't have any connectivity issues, but it's going to affect the behavior of the *original* library by virtue of using 1.6. If your application cares about console output, you could end up finding it really hard to work out where things have gone wrong..."
