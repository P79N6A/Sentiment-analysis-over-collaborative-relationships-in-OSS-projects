    "body": "Thanks for the PR, but there are several issues:\r\n-- I believe the v1.1.x branch is locked now (we cut v1.2.x release branch yesterday and no more changes are being done to v1.1.x)\r\n-- Why does this PR even go against v1.1.x  (wouldn't it be better to create against master)\r\n-- I see a lot of python code style / formatting improvements in this PR. That's fine but all such changes should strictly come in a separate PR unless you are actually changing a specific line of code for other reasons. With all the formatting changes, it really hard to see the real diff in functionality. Also, no formatting changes should be done in a release branch because that just doesn't make sense - improving code style only belongs to the master branch\r\n\r\nFor the reasons above, I recommend closing this PR and starting a fresh one against master (unless some fixes are needed in v1.2.x and in that case only the bugfixes should go there)."

    "body": "@jtattermusch: this feature has been in development since November (before it was clear that we were going to increase our release cadence). It was targeted at `v1.1.x` because that's what made sense at the time that this particular pull request was opened and I asked for it to be targeted at `v1.1.x`. Since GitHub now lets us retarget pull requests, I've retargeted it at `master`; `master`'ll probably never be out of date.\r\n\r\n@thunderboltsid: I agree with @jtattermusch about breaking out the stylistic bits. I imagine you're greatly frustrated by how long this has hung out in development; I'm frustrated too but I think breaking it into smaller pieces will help it find sooner resolution. Defining new environment variables? Maybe its own pull request. Making `run_tests/**.py` compatible with Python 3? Definitely its own pull request. Lastly, I apologize for erring in my estimation of when and on what branch this would land."

    "body": "This PR is now headed for master instead of v1.1.x as requested. My editor is generally set to follow the boy-scout principle and keeps cleaning stuff on it's own. Apologies for that. I have now reverted those changes manually. The reason why making test scripts python3.x compatible is part of this PR is so that the version of python that is being tested can also test itself. The reason why I didn't squash the commits into one (yet) has to do with changes being somewhat orthogonal to each other. With that said, I'll go ahead and close this PR and make multiple new PRs in the hope that it speeds the process of getting approved and merged a bit."
