    "body": "I fail to see what that would actually solve ? Unless you haven't quite got what the issue is - but I'll discuss that below.\n\nI mean, sure, it's a well known fact that Microsoft took on the wrong side of the Force when designing their API switch using #defines in their public headers, but if we want a Windows port, we have to live with that. Doing #include of Windows.h drags with it a plethora of #defines with very public names. But using public shaming here wouldn't actually suddenly make grpc++ compile under Windows, although it might improve my mood on the subject. Or maybe you didn't understand what the problem is: the crux of the issue is that server_builder.cc eventually ends up including windows.h because reasons, and is the one affected by the #define from windows.h. So it's not a matter of people including server_builder.h and suddenly having a polluted environment. It's the other way around: server_builder.cc is the one which eventually gets polluted.\n\nNow, here's the list of things that happens exactly:\n\n-) grpc and grpc++ public headers almost never include windows.h, except for atm_win32.h, for the interlocked functions definitions.\n-) the implementation code however will very definitely end up including windows.h to implement windows things\n\nAnd here's a list of potential solutions, classified in the order of worst to best in my opinion:\n\n-) include windows.h everywhere so that any and all #define will be propagated everywhere, mitigating the issue. This is by far the worst solution of all.\n-) doing #undef AddPort in server_builder.cc - bleargh.\n-) using WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN - this might seem the best option, as it tells windows.h to not include the universe, and will reduce the potential number of conflicts, but this presents us with the new problem that if someone uses grpc++ as a public API and hasn't WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN and includes windows.h before including server_builder.h, he'll get the reversed issue: ServerBuilder in our .h file with be declared with AddPortW, but our implementation will go with AddPort. This is where your suggestion might work, where we can explain to people why they need to include server_builder.h before windows.h in their code, or use WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN, but is still not optimal, because they might not be able to if grpc is a dependency of a dependency. Also, WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN still means you'll get #defines, just fewer, so this isn't a silver bullet either.\n-) renaming AddPort to something else.\n\nIn all cases, I don't think there's any guarantee that Microsoft will never add another conflicting API in the future, but unless I am missing your point, I don't see how this is something that could ever be dodged. We need to include windows.h in our implementations in order to get windows API in, and that means dragging with us unwanted #defines.\n"

    "body": "And I have an opposite opinion: I DO think it's unreasonable to request that the C++ API can't be mixed with Windows system headers. This makes for really poor integration experience for people. More specifically, what does that actually mean for people trying to use our C++ interface in a Windows piece of code ? Best-case scenario, they'll have to change their software to add WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN. We might be able to guide them towards that direction using your proposal, but that wouldn't cover all cases. Worst-case scenario they'll have to create an interface to our interface.\n\nImagine for example that in a single source file, people want to use grpc++ and another third party library. That other third party library might require to have windows.h without WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN, because it wasn't designed the same way as ours. Granted, that hypothetical third party library wouldn't be designed in a nice way, but that's not something either we or the people trying to integrate both libraries can control. At that point, this is integration hell because of our policy, and we'll prevent people from using grpc together with something else.\n\nHere is a real world example to expose what that hypothetical third party library would be: somebody writes a software under Linux. He uses grpc++. He also uses pthreads, because he didn't notice that we implement gpr_threads, or because he wants to use something we don't currently provide, such as pthread_key. Now having done his software under Linux, and being successful at it, he wishes to port it under Windows. He doesn't want to change his threads layer, and simply chooses to use pthreads-win32. Now pthread.h from the pthreads-win32 project includes windows.h. Integration hell right there. And I found this one on my first try - I'm sure more win32 ports of gnu software would do the same thing. And this is a worse example, because this would be the scenario of someone who wrote a candid Linux software, simply willing to try to compile it for Windows; he wouldn't even be a Windows expert. Yet solving grpc \"no windows headers\" policy vs pthreads-win32's pthread.h would require some understanding of what's going on with Windows.\n\nMy point here being that this policy means that people trying to integrate grpc inside their Windows software using our windows-specific visual studio projects and implementation (aka, something that has been explicitly designed for it) will have a harder time than Linux or Mac people.\n\nNow, I completely agree with you that future collisions with Microsoft new API is indeed a risk, and that'll fill me with rage if it ever happens. And for this I'd be more than happy to provide workarounds to Windows users such as what you suggested until such time we can benefit from a grpc version bump that'd do other API breakage. But I do believe this a risk worth taking if we want to ensure a smooth integration experience for our Windows users, or people trying to create cross platform softwares.\n"
