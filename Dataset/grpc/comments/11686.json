    "body": "I managed to compile grpc_csharp_ext using cmake! All I needed to do was\r\n1) \"source\" your cross-compile environment (I was using the linaro toolchain)\r\n2) mkdir build in the grpc repo root\r\n3) cd build\r\n4) cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE= -Dprotobuf_BUILD_TESTS=Off -DgRPC_INSTALL=Off -DCMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING=1 -DRUN_HAVE_POSIX_REGEX=0\r\n5) cd ..\r\n6) make grpc_csharp_ext\r\n\r\n@jtattermusch What is the strategy behind encoding the platform in the file name? (eg. grpc_csharp_ext.x86.so) Is it because of x86/x64? I'm asking because these .so files are huge, and as it is now, the NuGet packet includes both the x86 and the x64 version (~10Mb each). I don't think it would be a good idea to add the arm version as well (yet another 10Mb). Instead, the NuGet packet should be able to target multiple architectures. I can look into this if you want. Once done, the native extension loading C# code would also need some minor changes.\r\n\r\nOn a more generic tone, ARM support is key! With .Net Core now supporting ARM, gRPC becomes a really compelling communication protocol (I don't consider Mono production quality). REST is great, but when it comes to server-side notification or active content push, you need to go beyond REST."

    "body": "@tamaskaroly  thanks for the input! Very useful to have a proof of concept on ARM.\r\n\r\nAFAIR the names of the files (`grpc_csharp_ext.x86.so`) are based on what native nuget packages require (with the right subdir + filename, the native libraries are copied to the output directory when building automatically on newer platforms. On older platforms we have a msbuild .targets file that does that instead).\r\n\r\nOn an unrelated note, I think the binaries should be smaller than 10MB (I'd expect ~1MB each version?) - we can take a look at what's going on.\r\n\r\nI can see mutiple ways to support ARM:\r\n1. **most basic** publish docs how to crosscompile + implmenent a way to define custom path to native extension loader (then you can provide the right path to the crosscompiled extension manually at your app startup) - we even have an issue for this https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/4753\r\n2. provide an additional nuget package with pre-compiled ARM binaries. (`Grpc.Core.ArmSupport`?) After improving the native extension loader, just adding this depedency would make things work on ARM without any extra code needed on user side.\r\n3. include all native libraries in Grpc.Core, but as you pointed out, that might make the nuget too big in size and it would also pose a challenge to automated building (we'd need to build on ARM also).\r\n\r\nBtw, are you talking about ARM on Windows or under Linux?"
