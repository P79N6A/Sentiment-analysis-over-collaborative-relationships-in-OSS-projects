    "body": "The C library has an API to listen to changes in channel state (connecting, ready, transient failure, fatal failure, ...). We need to subscribe to those notifications in addition to the ones we already have from the OS. The reason is that sometimes a server closes a connection (by sending `goaway`) without there being any connectivity problems (e.g. after some timeout of it being idle). If we don't listen to channel state, the C library will be oblivious of it, the `goaway` will just remain enqueued, and the next RPC to that host will invariably fail. By subscribing, the C library does look at those things.\n"
