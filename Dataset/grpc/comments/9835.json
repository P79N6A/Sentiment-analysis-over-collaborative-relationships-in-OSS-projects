    "body": "That's certainly an option. I prefer keeping them separate because it's convenient to keep them all in the same folder since they need to be moved into a different directory for the oss-fuzz build process. Also, they have nothing to do with our own running of the fuzzer tests, so it might add bloat/confusion to our repo, but I'm willing to move them to the fuzzers' directories for other reasons."
