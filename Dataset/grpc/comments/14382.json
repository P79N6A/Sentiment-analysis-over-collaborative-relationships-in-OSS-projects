Because pick_first will only discard the currently working subchannel list when the pending one is READY, the LB channel will remain READY during the update. Because the LB channel state doesn't change, the glb_policy doesn't know when to restart the LB call."

    "body": "We need a way to be notified about the update completion. \r\n\r\n- Since the LB channel state is unchanged, we should use some finer condition, e.g., the subchannel_list is changed. But I haven't found any clean way to do so. \r\n- An alternative is to start a retry timer after starting the update. But we don't know how long the update needs. The restarting may happens too early and we still connect to the old balancer.\r\n\r\nAny idea? @dgquintas @markdroth  "
