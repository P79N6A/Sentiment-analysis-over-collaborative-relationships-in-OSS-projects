    "body": "As discussed in #9795, returning an `INTERNAL` status is probably a good default. The programmer can very easily override that if they want a different status code (by writing their own `catch` block), but returning an `INTERNAL` error is arguably better than crashing the server.\r\n\r\n(The runtime cost of the `catch` block is zero unless you're actually throwing an exception, unless you're on 32-bit x86 on Windows, which is the only platform that I know of that still uses handler chaining instead of table-based unwinding.)"

    "body": "@tudor: (Just to clarify for those who didn't follow the earlier issue: this is with regard to bullet item 3 listed above) I would prefer UNKNOWN over INTERNAL as the default. According to our status code docs, INTERNAL refers to a breakdown of a system invariant but UNKNOWN means that we don't understand the situation (which is literally true here since the details of the method handler are unknown to the gRPC library). And, like you said, the programmer can write their own blocks if they want.\r\n"
