    "body": "Addressing your comments in an ad-hoc way because github:\n\n> The only substantive remaining change is the reference that needs to be taken for the > lb_on_server_status_received() callback.\n\nI don't know which one you are referring to. `lb_on_server_status_received` takes a weak ref on line 1218. (\"grpclb_retry_timer\").\n\n> Removing the assertion is good, but my broader question here still stands: If the LB server shuts down, shouldn't we go back and pick a new one? Or will the client continue to try to use the bad server forever?\n> If the server shuts down, the `lb_on_server_status_received` would be called with `glb_policy->shutting_down` being false, which would result in a retry. Because the lb_call is recreated, the pick first policy in the lb_channel should pick a healthy LB server if one is available.\n"
