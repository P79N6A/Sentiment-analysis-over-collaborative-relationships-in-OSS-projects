    "body": "The Node client should already reconnect to a server by default. If you experience a \"Connect Failed\" error, that means that you made a request while the server is down. The client reconnects after that, but backs off for some time first to avoid pounding on an already overloaded server. You can configure that behavior with channel arguments as described in [this comment](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/11411#issuecomment-308899967)."
