    "body": "I suspect this is not really an issue.  It's true that we can't differentiate between a GOAWAY and (e.g.) the TCP connection unexpectedly failing, but I'm not sure we really need to, because we can treat those cases the same way.  We *can* differentiate between those two cases and the case where a connection attempt fails, and that's what's really important."
