    "body": "@muxi I have come to this issue as well. The problem is not Cocoapods really, the problem is that a lot of projects support Catharge without it really interfering with the project (e.g no Podspec files to maintain). I have to use gRPC (because I wrote my server in gRPC-Go) so I'm using Cocoapods at the moment for a Swift iOS client, but we could really simplify the entire build with Carthage. I'd rather not go back to REST just for the sake of a build mechanism, so I'll live with it - but it would be a great bonus!!"
