    "body": "@ctiller and @dklempner : I have done the following changes: \n- Significantly revised the ref-counting logic (separated locking and ref-counting in to different functions) \n- Removed(`pollset->pi_mu`) lock which was redundant\n- Converted `merged_to` and `ref_count` fields in the polling island to atomics. This _significantly_ reduced the complexity of `polling_island_lock_pair` function\n- Removed taking any locks in `pollset_work_and_unlock` function which is the fast-path\n\nIMO, the code looks much cleaner now and all the tests seem to be passing (the failures are all known except for some error that [generate_projects.sh](https://grpc-testing.appspot.com/job/gRPC_pull_requests/10156/config=opt,language=sanity,platform=linux/testReport/junit/%28root%29/tests/tools_buildgen_generate_projects_sh/) is reporting)\n\nCan you PTAL ?\n"
