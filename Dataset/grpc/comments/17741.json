    "body": "A few more details about the existing test coverage related code.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the coverage context is injected during the loading of test cases at `src/python/grpcio_tests/tests/_loader.py` (see `coverage.py`'s [doc](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/v4.5.x/howitworks.html#execution)).\r\n\r\nSecondly, the report generation in our infrastructure code is not working as expected. To generate coverage report, one needs to run `run_tests.py` with `gcov` mode. Then the actual test coverage reports will be generated as `reports/python/*.html`. The core problem is that there are 690 of them, and it is hard to access them."
