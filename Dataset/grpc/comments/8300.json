    "body": "Thanks for your contribution!\n\nSome quick initial feedback:\n1. Copyright will need to be assigned to gRPC and all files should take the normal gRPC copyright banner\n2. However this ends up getting implemented... it should not require changes to epoll/tcp related files, especially not changes that call out ucx explicitly - our usual style is to factor platform specific code into `_$platform.{c,h}` files\n3. We will need a way of testing this without special hardware with our run_tests infrastructure\n4. transport is a word that means something very different in the grpc codebase than what ucx is providing\n\nIf the intent is to replace grpc_tcp with ucx, then I'd suggest an approach whereby we have a tcp_ucx.c implementation that gets enabled/disabled with a `#define`.\n"

    "body": "@ctiller Thank you for the feedback. I will take care about proposed changes.\nI would like to implement automatic endpoint selection instead hard-coded `#define`. I see it in the following way (please correct me):\n1. add an auxiliary field in chttp2 handshake procedure and use it as UCX HW address (~400 bytes)\n2. If the server gets incoming connection (in regular way) it looks for this field. If it is not zero (end server support UCX) it creates and dispatch  closure which will establish UCX connection with the client.\n2. If the client support UCX it packed UCX HW address into chttp2 field and send it to server. If positive answer received - it dispatch closure to establish UCX based connection with the server.\n\nCould you recommend me some example field I could use (as an example) to create UCX address filed in chttp2 handshake mechanism?\n\nAlso, Craig, what do you think if we implement UCX as third-party tool in gRPC to allow build gRPC from scratch without additional knowledge of UCX build procedure?\n"

This could solve particular user need if non-tcp stack used. From another perspective, it prevents other users to get the same functionality \"from the box\" in gRPC.\n"
