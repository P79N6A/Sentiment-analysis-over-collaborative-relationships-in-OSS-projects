    "body": "@sebbov GRPC_ENABLE_FORK_SUPPORT was added to support usage where fork is not followed by exec. A pthread_atfork() handler was added to cleanup exiting threads before fork and manage the FDs after fork. This change introduced the deadlock bug which users can run into when doing fork/exec. As a quick workaround, GRPC_ENABLE_FORK_SUPPORT when set to false doesn't invoke this new logic. At this point this is tribal knowledge. A fix will be coming soon. "
