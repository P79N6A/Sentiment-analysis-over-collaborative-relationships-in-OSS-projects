    "body": "I found the reason. I use two async grpc clients which connect two kinds of services of different processes. Each grpc client use one CQ to get the async result. The problem here is that I forgot to invoke grpc::CompletionQueue::AsyncNext to get the result in one of the CQ. When I added the AsyncNext logic, all is well. But I still confuse the above question:\n\n> One thing I cannot understand is the completion queue in the stack is not the same one I bind with 'stub->AsyncPushFileBlock' in the code.

    "body": "When you start the RPC, you bind it to a CQ and its notifications come in on that CQ, so that you'll see it when you call CQ::Next on that CQ. But in general, there could be other CQs in the system, so maybe you're seeing the other CQ on the stack? (Particularly if your system also has synchronous method calls, each one creates its own CQ.) Another thing - there are CQs at the C++ layer that wrap CQs at the core layer - is the address that you're seeing the core layer as opposed to the C++ layer?\n"
