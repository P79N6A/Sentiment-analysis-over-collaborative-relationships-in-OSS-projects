    "body": "Pinging @ctiller per his remark on Twitter.\r\n\r\nAlso recognizing that this is almost certainly a huge PITA to fix, because threads and fork() don't really play well together. Unfortunately, Python's menu of options for parallelism is very small: threads don't really do the right thing in CPython, multiprocessing brings in all these fun fork() issues, and subprocess fork()+exec()'s which means API's are fundamentally nasty and slow. Sigh. I'm working on libraries to at least somewhat mitigate the latter now...\r\n\r\nI've verified that in code that uses subprocess, this issue indeed doesn't occur."

It shows that in cpython posix implementation of os.fork(), it calls PyOS_AfterFork, where local objects of other threads gets GC-ed since there's only one thread (the current one) after fork. When the grpc server object in main thread is being deleted, it trys to stop itself, and stuck in a call to shutdown_event.wait().\r\nI worked around this using subprocess.Popen instead of os.fork+exec, where the fork+exec is completed in C and no GC is needed, given preexec_fn is None.\r\nI wonder if grpc server could check current thread ID to determine if it really need to stop gracefully on deletion."

    "body": "I ran into a new variant of this that I haven't seen until we updated to grpc 1.10: occasionally a subprocess will log the following error to stderr, which is problematic since I'm using fork+exec to capture stdout and stderr from a subprocess, and this message pollutes the output. I suspect this is because I am calling `subprocess.Popen` with `close_fds=True`, so before calling `exec()` it attempts to close everything except stdin, stderr, stdout. I bet the grpc post-fork handler in the child starts some thread which is unhappy when its epoll descriptor is closed.\r\n\r\nSetting the environment variable `GRPC_ENABLE_FORK_SUPPORT=false` seems to make this go away. At least previously it was reproducible within about ~5 forks, and I just ran it for 100 times and did not see it. I may attempt to create a \"subprocess proxy\" to avoid the need for setting this variable ...\r\n\r\nThe error I see is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nE0312 17:48:23.712781235    1283 backup_poller.cc:122]       Run client channel backup poller: {\"created\":\"@1520876903.712729767\",\"description\":\"pollset_work\",\"file\":\"src/core/lib/iomgr/ev_epoll1_linux.cc\",\"file_line\":229,\"referenced_errors\":[{\"created\":\"@1520876903.712726941\",\"description\":\"OS Error\",\"errno\":9,\"file\":\"src/core/lib/iomgr/ev_epoll1_linux.cc\",\"file_line\":654,\"os_error\":\"Bad file descriptor\",\"syscall\":\"epoll_wait\"}]}\r\n```\r\n"

    "body": "@jeffreybrowning From the information you provide, it sounds like you are using other libraries that also involve processes and threads. gRPC's fork support will not help make those libraries fork-compatible. If you have reason to think the failures are still caused by gRPC, can you create a new issue on github and provide more details? Thanks!\r\n\r\n@remram44 I did not intend for my comment in May to be interpreted as a \"wontfix\" response, as I was actively working on a more general fork solution at that point. Rather, I just wanted to consolidate a largeish number of fork-related issues into a central tracking issue, as was mentioned in my comment:\r\n\r\n> Let's continue to use #15334 to track adding more general fork support to gRPC.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that this did not result in followers of this issue receiving notification when progress was made on #15334, and I will try to find a better way to handle this type of notification in the future."
