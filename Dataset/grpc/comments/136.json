    "body": "So after further investigation, there is nothing to fix in the ruby implementation.  However this issue will be kept open for tracking.\n\nThe issue happens when the Java client accesses a ruby server and the java implementation where the test response has a PayloadType field.\n- the Java server is defined and implemented using proto2\n- Ruby gRPC requires proto3, as that it uses the official google-protobuf proto implementation\n  hence the two implement\n\nOne of the key differences b/w proto2 and proto3 is how they treat default values; what's happening is that the \n- the response value of the PayloadType fields is the same as its default value\n- ruby (proto3) does not include a field in it's serialized form if it's value is the same as the default value\n- java (proto2) assumes that the field is missing\n- so the test fails, as java believes that the received message is incorrect.\n"
