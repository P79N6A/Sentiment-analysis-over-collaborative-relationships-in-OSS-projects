Having them share a completion queue still undermines that aspect of the test. Use of threads doesn't, I don't think, and inserting \"do X in a separate thread\" in several places throughout the test doesn't interrupt the overall flow of the test, at least not if the off-threading is moved out into a well-abstracted helper function?\n\nAnother high-level, philosophical question about this change: if _low_test.py has to change in this pull request because of changes to the semantics to the C Core's completion queue semantics, shouldn't this pull request include a change to grpc.h? It doesn't at the moment, right, unless my browser's find-in-page is broken?\n"

    "body": "Philosophy note: this PR is still in progress, so documentation is probably\nlacking. That said I'm not certain that it's changing semantics from what\nwe've had for a long while, rather it's exploiting loopholes that have been\ndeliberately left open to allow this sort of thing. I'll make a lawyer pass\nover grpc.h before this is finalized regardless.\n\nWith your proposed rewrite you would still end up needing two threads\npolling completion_queue_next for things to work out.... meaning that at\nevery point where you do:\n\nself.server_completion_queue.get(_FUTURE);\n\nYou'd also need a thread doing:\n\nself.client_completion_queue.get(XXX);\n\nand asserting that such a thread receives nothing in the period of time\nthat the server_completion_queue took to get something - in other words,\nboth threads would need some barrier logic at every completion queue poll\nin order to keep the logic in the test as-is. I don't see a way to make\nthat readable - but if it's preferred, I'd be happy to review proposals.\n\nFor an example of what this would need to transform into, take a look at my\nchanges to src/ruby/spec/client_server_spec.rb - it's the (mostly)\nequivalent test for Ruby, and was written in such a way that spinning up\nmultiple threads was the obvious and simple thing to do.\n\nFinally, in the version of _low_test.py I've proposed the testing of ordering\nof events is preserved in all cases except the terminal event handling on\nline 378 of the original test - and I would argue is strengthened, as the\nnew phrasing of the test additionally guarantees that no event is received\nby the peer completion queue at a particular step.\n\nOn Thu, May 28, 2015 at 9:53 AM Nathaniel Manista notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Oh, and to respond directly to \"This makes it very difficult to reason\n> about the ordering of events as you do in this test.\": I would not want\n> _low_test to lose the reasoning about the ordering of events that it has\n> today.

    "body": "For those following along at home: @ctiller and I just talked this over, and the point of misunderstanding between us comes from this work making a big change to the semantics of calls and completion queues.  Without this change, a call sequence like\n\ncall.write(data)\nwrite_done_indication = completion_queue.next()\n\nhas semantics of \"request that work be done in the first call, understand that work may be done between calls, and then at some arbitrary later time ask for acknowledgement of the work having been done\". With this change, the same call sequence has semantics of \"describe some work to be done in the first call, understand that it may not be done between calls, and then in the second call do the work if it has not by chance or larger circumstance already had occasion to happen\". With this change work like \"transmit bytes on the wire\" is no longer guaranteed to happen with call.write alone; the call to completion_queue.next is now required to ensure that transmission of data on the wire takes place.\n\nWe spoke of possibly changing Core API function names to reflect these different behaviors.\n"
