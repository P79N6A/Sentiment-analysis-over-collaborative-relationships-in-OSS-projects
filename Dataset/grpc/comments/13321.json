    "body": "This is intentional. All other statuses are mapped to `UNKNOWN`. The canonical way to signal other custom statuses to the client is by using the status proto in the metadata. I discussed this with @ejona86 as well and this behavior is consistent with the Java implementation, so ideally, Go should map arbitrary statuses to `UNKNOWN` (cc: @dfawley)."

It would be really great if there could be a custom status. Or, maybe, there could be three values: status, custom value, and details. And one of status fields would be \"OTHER\" and then you could set custom value to a value you want."
