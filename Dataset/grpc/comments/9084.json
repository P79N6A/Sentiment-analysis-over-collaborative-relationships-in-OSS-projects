    "body": "@jtattermusch Personally I'm using C++, so I built (past tense, yes, using the aforementioned josefizso/grpc-windows repo) grpc++.\r\n\r\nFirst I ran `grpc_clone.bat`. Then I had to do the following:\r\n\r\nFind -> Replace (I use Notepad++) all *.vcxproj files in the grpc distribution (recursively) as follows:\r\n\r\n`<TreatWarningAsError>true</TreatWarningAsError>` with `<TreatWarningAsError>false</TreatWarningAsError>` (as an aside: seriously, guys, stop it with the `-Werror` already; I know this is very useful for development and ensuring correctness, but real-world compilers are **going** to have warnings that you didn't anticipate; users lack the patience to fix them; most of the time they don't actually hurt anything; and this needs to NOT be the default in code that's being released to *users*!)\r\n\r\nThen, because I was linking grpc++ with code that uses `/MD` (dynamic linking to msvcrt and the Visual Studio C++ runtime) and recompiling those binaries is extremely difficult and undesirable for reasons I won't get into, I did another find/replace (recursive, on *.vcxproj) for this:\r\n\r\n`<RuntimeLibrary>MultiThreaded</RuntimeLibrary>` with `<RuntimeLibrary>MultiThreadedDLL</RuntimeLibrary>`\r\n\r\nAnd respectively,\r\n\r\n`<RuntimeLibrary>MultiThreadedDebug</RuntimeLibrary>` with `<RuntimeLibrary>MultiThreadedDebugDLL</RuntimeLibrary>`\r\n\r\nfor debug configurations.\r\n\r\nNext, the protobuf dependency in the third_party directory emits Visual Studio projects from CMake, so I had to patch this in third_party/protobuf/CMakeLists.txt:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif(${flag_var} MATCHES \"/MD\")\r\n        string(REGEX REPLACE \"/MD\" \"/MT\" ${flag_var} \"${${flag_var}}\")\r\n      endif(${flag_var} MATCHES \"/MD\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n\r\n```\r\nif(${flag_var} MATCHES \"/MT\")\r\n        string(REGEX REPLACE \"/MT\" \"/MD\" ${flag_var} \"${${flag_var}}\")\r\n      endif(${flag_var} MATCHES \"/MT\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n...for the same /MT vs. /MD (whether or not to statically link the VC/VC++ runtime) problem.\r\n\r\nIs that all? I can't really remember. Basically, getting a working build of grpc++ to do what I want on Windows is an absolute nightmare, made *significantly* less horrid by josefiszo/grpc-windows, but still requiring significant manual hacking. Bring a powerful text editor with recursive find/replace or you will perish in the attempt.\r\n\r\nOf course, after that, you have to run `grpc_build.bat` and pray. \r\n\r\nWhat *would* be a dream would be to have a build tool in the grpc upstream that would build the entire thing in a working, default configuration without any patching, editing .vcxproj files, etc. I don't care which tool you use, but it should either be one built into Windows (Powershell? CMD?), something native to Visual Studio (pre-build scripts in the project files? doesn't matter to me), or CMake, which is easy enough to install and universal enough that I'd be perfectly happy if `cmake ..\\build` would generate a *working* set of Visual Studio projects (or ninja files, or whatever) for grpc/grpc++ and its dependencies under third_party.\r\n\r\nI'm really happy with using grpc++ once I get it running, but there's a pretty high barrier to entry right now, and with binaries being unavailable for Windows, it's not fun to be a developer trying to *use* grpc/grpc++ for the first time on Windows.\r\n\r\nThe pain is way, *way* less on GNU/Linux because the build system \"just works\" if you have the dependencies, and you can install the dependencies with a package manager trivially. Mostly the same on OS X, except that there were some GNU-isms that didn't work with Apple's Clang compiler that comes with the latest XCode, so I had to manually install GCC with Homebrew, and then build grpc with GCC. But that's neither here nor there."
