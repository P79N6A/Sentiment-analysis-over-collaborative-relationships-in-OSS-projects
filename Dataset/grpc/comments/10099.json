    "body": "I don't think this is the right fix. The failing tests in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/10056 are all failing to even connect to the server. They shouldn't need more time just to establish connections. \r\n\r\nI will be sending out a PR in a minute that updates the http2 Python server to fail when it encounters an error when attempting to listen to a port - right now, it just silently swallows such problems. This will at least let us know if the server is even working when failures like in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/10056 occur. (I haven't looked into the docker networking, but since the http2 server is hard-coded to use ports 8080-8085, it's possible there are intermittent conflicts on these ports that are causing the flaky tests)."
