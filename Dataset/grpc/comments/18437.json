    "body": "Thank you for adding me to review. I would like to add that there are two styles I've seen people use. Some prefer to use release/acquire everywhere, and document relaxed atomics. Some prefer to use relaxed, and document when non-relaxed is needed. David Klempner taught me to do that latter, and I am in that camp. The main point is that simply doing release/acquire doesn't guarantee correctness (for example,there would be subtle bugs if we update a field after an release store, and read it after the acquire load) and if we use them, we should document why it's needed and why the current ordering is correct.\r\n\r\nOf course, this is all subjective, and I would go with any style you would personally prefer."
