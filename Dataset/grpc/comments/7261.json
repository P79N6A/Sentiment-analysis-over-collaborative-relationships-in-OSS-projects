    "body": "I stumbled upon this old issue while searching for another issue. The code base has changed quite a bit since this was filed and I don't have immediate access to the ARM environment you mentioned to try and repro. Please let me know if you can see it on the current 1.9.x or master branch heads. Otherwise, if you are unable to repro or we don't hear back, I think closing this issue makes sense (in that case, feel free to ping or refile, obviously). Thanks!"
