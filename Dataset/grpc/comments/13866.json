    "body": "Apologies for the confusion and not being more clear in the release notes. I believe the following entry under 1.8.0 tried to communicate this particular change in behavior--although it does not directly mention credentials, it transitively covers that as part of metadata--but I can totally empathize how it can go unnoticed. (to further clarify, the old behavior was never intended to be supported and happened to work because the type distinction was previously loosely enforced):\r\n\r\n\"More strict enforcement of type-correctness of metadata values. (#13672)\""
