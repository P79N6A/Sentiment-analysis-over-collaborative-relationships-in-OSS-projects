    "body": "We have continuous integration tests that ensure the build and install work on [Debian jessie as well a number of other distros](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/tools/dockerfile/distribtest) and they are passing.  My manual tests on jessie last time showed it pulled the binary package from `pip` and did not even attempt building from source and it worked fine. It seems you are trying to use PyPy here. I am not sure if PyPy is supported at all, so I defer to @nathanielmanistaatgoogle there. Additionally, if you have the same issue with CPython 2.7, please let us know if you can repro with a clean Jessie (ideally please provide a Dockerfile as well as the shell commands to run to repro the issue).

I indeed works on CPython 2.7 with the same Linux distro and GCC version.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the issue is related to PyPy.\r\nStill, it would be great if this could be fixed.\r\nWe are actually getting `grpc` through transitive dependencies, and it seems that such a thing would make them unsupported on PyPy (specifically `google-cloud-bigtable` and `google-cloud`).\r\nIf you decide that you will not support, I will perhaps open a ticket for those package to pin down the `grpc` version to avoid the issue."
