    "body": "We hit the same issue as @zplzpl @pavamana1123. Our problem was with the flatbuffer codec, or rather, the fact that we didn't instantiate the server with it.\r\n\r\nWhen creating our server and connections, we switched to \r\n```go\r\nvar server = grpc.NewServer(grpc.CustomCodec(flatbuffers.FlatbuffersCodec{}))\r\nvar conn, err = grpc.Dial(addr, grpc.WithInsecure(), grpc.WithCodec(flatbuffers.FlatbuffersCodec{}))\r\n```\r\nI recommend going through the flatbuffers grpc go test.\r\nThe master's head test doesn't build at the time of writing, so you should checkout an earlier commit like  https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/commit/cc8424009853447b209c5d3ccb12c23a2f134fa4\r\n\r\nIn hope that this helps. \r\nIt should at least provide some reference for anyone searching for this issue."
