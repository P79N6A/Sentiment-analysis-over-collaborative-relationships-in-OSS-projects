    "body": "It is a well known issue with core that the first request made after restarting a server will fail. This is because when the client isn't sending requests it isn't polling, and thus will not be able notice that the connection is broken.\r\n\r\nThis can be mitigated with `GRPC_CLIENT_CHANNEL_BACKUP_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`. See https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/environment_variables.md for more details on that"
