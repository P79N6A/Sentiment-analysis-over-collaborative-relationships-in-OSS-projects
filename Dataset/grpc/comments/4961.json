    "body": "The version currently on PyPI is not particularly good about installation, I'll give you that (this'll be much, much nicer come next version).\n\nThe protoc plugin for Python is supposed to come from a separate package. I can't quite remember at the moment whence though so I'll leave that at that for now (will try to get back to you).\n\nThe instructions for building from source have been outdated for a bit. The steps for a source installation are:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/grpc/grpc\ncd grpc\ngit submodule update --init\npip install -rrequirements.txt\nGRPC_PYTHON_BUILD_WITH_CYTHON=1 pip install .\n```\n\nThe above should chuck a warning at you about a missing plugin (instead of failing; it isn't a necessary part of the build here).\n\nIf you need to generate protobuf code from `.proto` files (i.e. need the `protoc` plugin for reasons beyond the error you're experiencing):\n\n```\nmake\n```\n\nThe relevant version of `protoc` and its plugins will end up in the `bins/opt/protobuf` and `bins/opt` directories respectively.\n\nThat should get you rolling from the master branch, at least.\n\nOr did you want to stay on a release branch?\n"
