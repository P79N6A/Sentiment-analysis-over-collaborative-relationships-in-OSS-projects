In the end, I cancelled the RPC upon any error coming back:\r\n\r\n`__block GRPCProtoCall *rpc;\r\n  CompletionBlock connectionErrorCallback =\r\n      ^(id _Nullable response, NSError * _Nullable error) {\r\n        if (error) {\r\n          [rpc cancel];\r\n        }\r\n        responseHandler(response, error);\r\n      };\r\n  // Generate and start the RPC call.\r\n  rpc = [self.myService RPCWithRequest:request handler:connectionErrorCallback];\r\n  [self startRPC:rpc];`\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\nThanks,"

    "body": "Hi Muxi,\n\nThis issue was reproducible on WiFi, never tried on other networks. The\nphone (an iPhone7) was always on airplane mode. To reproduce it we would:\n\n-Turn off the wifi.\n-Start the request and receive the no connectivity error.\n-Turn on the wifi again.\n\nIf I remember correctly, we were able of getting the same error on iOS\nsimulators. Then again, the error wouldn't occur depending on the timing of\nthe connectivity switching (perhaps a race condition?).\n\nThanks,\n\nOn Wed, Jul 19, 2017 at 5:52 PM, Muxi Yan <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Tried with both WiFi and cellular and this problem did not reproduce.\n> After turning airplane mode off (tried turning on/off Wifi as well), both\n> peers remained idle without receiving anything for at least 30s.\n>\n> Any further information (platform, iOS version, stream/unary call, etc.)\n> that is helpful on debugging/reproducing this would be appreciated.\n>\n> â€”\n> You are receiving this because you commented.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/10302#issuecomment-316564724>, or mute\n> the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ANlI2TFHx7lGDrKGaaLY6hB61UEutXoSks5sPqTBgaJpZM4ModV->\n> .\n>\n"
