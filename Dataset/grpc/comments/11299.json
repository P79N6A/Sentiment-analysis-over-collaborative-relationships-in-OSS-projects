    "body": "@nathanielmanistaatgoogle That link refers to oral tradition (I assume from google). What are we optimizing for? Latency? Throughput? CPU/Power usage? I'd imagine the first 2 are affected by network conditions, and I would guess that at least the last one is heavily influenced by choice of language and protobuf library. For example, open source Python protos are pretty slow, so it may be better to have fewer messages that are bigger in size. But It's hard to say without writing some benchmarks :)\r\n\r\nBTW you basically need channel arguments to create secure channel (override ssl to match cert), so I don't see it as an advanced feature. Overall we've found the documentation to be pretty sparse so we just read the code. If you don't want certain things to be used, it would be helpful if you could leave comments to that effect.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, we noticed that max_message_length was split in two, these sorts of changes aren't very friendly to downstream. (This change in particular is trivial to deal with but other API change have caused us some pain).\r\n\r\n@kpayson64 unfortunately I can't find where I saw that anymore, sorry.\r\n\r\nI'm going to close out this issue since we've confirmed that 200MB messages work with master, but please consider improving the documentation to make life easier for users."
