Yeah it won't work if you don't have the protobuff static libraries in your project.\r\n\r\nWould it be wrong if we include this headers in the podspec anyway. Both libraries work so close together that it makes sense to add these files in the grpc pod spec. \r\n\r\nI know that doing this would need to add the protobuff libraries, but as I understand those headers are from the grpc code base so it won't make sense to add them when ( in the future ) we have a protobuff pod spec.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?
