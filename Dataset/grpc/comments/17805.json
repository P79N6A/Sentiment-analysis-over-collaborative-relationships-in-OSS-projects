    "body": "I think the right behavior is that the empty string should be set to SERVING by default, but no other services should be automatically set to SERVING until the application explicitly does so.  I think this reflects the expected use cases:\r\n\r\n- There are environments (like what we do internally) where health checking is enabled by default using \"\" as the service name.  In those environments, applications that don't want to explicitly manage their own health status can do nothing, and the right thing will happen.\r\n\r\n- For any service that wants to explictly manage its health status, it can use a different service name in both the service config and the server application code, and the service should not be considered healthy until the application's custom code has explicitly verified that it is healthy."
