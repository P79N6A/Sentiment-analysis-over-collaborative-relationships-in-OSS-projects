    "body": "@adelez, I merged the PR before I received the comment from you.\r\n\r\nCurrently I am not planning to introduce this for interop tests because it will take more work to make use of changes this PR (and that's what I am planning to work on in the nearest future). We might try to introduce a similar change for interop tests later (but on the other hand, running multiple instances of interop tests is in fact what stress tests are doing)."
