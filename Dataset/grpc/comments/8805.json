    "body": "This seems to be similar to other reports we've received recently: we haven't yet published the precompiled native extension for Node 7, and it would be pretty difficult to compile it on Windows yourself. You should be able to get it to work simply by downgrading to Node 6.\r\n\r\nSince we have now received a few complaints about this, I'll look into publishing Node 7 binaries for gRPC 1.0.1. Otherwise, they will definitely be in gRPC 1.0.2."
