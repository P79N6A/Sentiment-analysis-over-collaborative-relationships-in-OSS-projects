I.e.:\n\n``` ruby\ntarget 'whatever' do\n  platform :ios, '9.0'\n  use_frameworks!\n\n  fix_repo = 'https://github.com/jcanizales/grpc.git'\n  fix_branch = 'support-dynamic-frameworks'\n\n  pod 'Protobuf'\n  pod 'BoringSSL', :podspec => \"https://github.com/jcanizales/grpc/raw/#{fix_branch}/src/objective-c/BoringSSL.podspec\"\n\n  pod 'gRPC', :git => \"#{fix_repo}\", :branch => \"#{fix_branch}\"\n  pod 'gRPC-Core', :git => \"#{fix_repo}\", :branch => \"#{fix_branch}\", :submodules => true\n  pod 'gRPC-RxLibrary', :git => \"#{fix_repo}\", :branch => \"#{fix_branch}\"\n  pod 'gRPC-ProtoRPC', :git => \"#{fix_repo}\", :branch => \"#{fix_branch}\"\nend\n```\n\nThat should fix your problem, as nanopb's sources are brought in as a submodule.\n\nAlso, nice trick pointing `:podspec` to a URL; I didn't know one could do that!\n"

    "body": "Yeah, I think the explanation is that, after Cocoapods clones the repo you specified in your Podfile, it uses the podspec in it but ignores the `source` attribute (because it's going to use the files in the repo it just cloned). So then it never gets to init the submodules, if it didn't upon cloning the repo. But let me know if the change I suggested doesn't work for you, because I recall it happened to me too at some point and I solved it that way.\n"

    "body": "> Was it necessary to make gRPC be packaged as a dynamic framework?\n\nThat's correct. Cocoapods will only create one framework per podspec (not per subspec). So keeping the four libraries as subspecs of one podspec would have meant users switching to dynamic frameworks needing to rewrite their imports (and we try very hard not to break existing code since we went beta).\n\nIt would have also meant complicating the podspec even more (assuming it was actually possible to achieve in one podspec), while the separation simplified them all.\n\nOne downside of the separation is that people have to change s/gRPC/gRPC-ProtoRPC/ in their proto-generating podspecs. But we already have to ask them to modify the podspec to add the new Protobuf macro, so it's something we had to do anyway. Another downside is a bit more of work when submitting the podspecs to Cocoapods' trunk. Hopefully, we'll automate that submission soon so we don't have to care about that.\n"

    "body": "@mesmerizingr The problem solved in the protobuf side was slightly different. There, the need was:\n- `#import \"google/protobuf/Any.pbobjc.h\"` for build systems like Blaze that don't move headers around.\n- `#import <Protobuf/Any.pbobjc.h>` or `#import <Protobuf/google/protobuf/Any.pbobjc.h>` for Cocoapods using dynamic frameworks.\n- For Cocoapods using static libraries, any of the three options above could be made to work. This was important because it meant all Cocoapods users could use the same type of imports, independently of whether they wanted dynamic frameworks. So we could define the preprocessor macro in Protobuf.podspec and have it defined for all Cocoapods users (at least we were counting on that :) ).\n\nIn gRPC we already had the headers under directories matching the library names (e.g. `src/objective-c/GRPCClient/GRPCCall.h`), which worked alright for both Blaze and Cocoapods-static-libraries. If we kept only one podspec, the imports when using dynamic frameworks would need to be like `<gRPC/...>` for all four libraries. But podspecs can't tell whether dynamic frameworks are going to be used or not, because that's specified in the app's `Podfile`. So the sanest thing was just to split.\n"
