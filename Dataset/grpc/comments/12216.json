An external user wouldn't be able to provide their own build script. I thought about something like this:\r\n\r\nWe could give each language (in scenario_config) a method `build_cmdline` that returns the command used to build the language. But then builds of different languages will run in parallel and all [compile C++ code](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/61c913531c1b36a810b39785ae88e1c549ef2939/tools/run_tests/performance/build_performance.sh#L31) leading to a race.\r\n\r\nDoes gRPC team have an opinion on how to best resolve this? Maybe compile C++ in a separate jobset?"

We can insert build commands in our layer.\r\n\r\nStill, `build_performance.sh` has a default case that calls `run_tests.py`. (IIUC, this runs unit tests for verification before running perf tests right?) If we add a language, say `gapic_java`, the tool will try to `run_tests.py -l gapic_java` which isn't valid. I think the easiest way out is to list out the languages in `build_performance.sh`. Are you OK with this?\r\n\r\nA bunch of these tests are also failing in other PRs, so I don't think it's related to this change. Not sure about \"expected\" though."
