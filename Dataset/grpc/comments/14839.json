    "body": "I can see that this could be useful but currently this is not a priority.\r\n- current build works well, you only need to fetch the c-ares submodule (which I'd consider only a minor pain).\r\n- supporting an extra source for c-ares library means more scenarios to test and it is non-trivial to add and maintain those tests\r\n- our submodule is currently at c-ares 1.13, while e.g. in debian stretch is at 1.12 (there might be a regression if allowing a lower c-ares version and that's more things to tests once again).\r\n- can you build on debian using make?"
