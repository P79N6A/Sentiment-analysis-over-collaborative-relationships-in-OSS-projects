I was convinced that it would hang forever so I let it run overnight. At some point it bailed. But it's certainly not 2 seconds.\nThis is C++ on OSX and if I pause with a debugger I see that there are two threads. the thread where my code makes the call, and then a thread where grpc is blocking on getaddrinfo.\n\nI just realized that I have timestamps on my logging output so when I get another look I'll note the actual time.\n\nHow can figure out what's wrong here?\n"

Everybody has to use std::chrono::duration now instead and so problem solved. Sorry to waste your time!\n"
