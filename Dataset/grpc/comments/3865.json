If there is no hope that there'll be SSL support on that platform, then GRPC may not be the right choice for the project.\n\nIt has been a few weeks since last time I looked at this, but I _think_ I managed to compile SSL manually, but not as part of the GRPC build (which seemed to insist on initiating the SSL build on its own and didn't care that I had already built the libraries manually in those directories).  When I say I think I managed to compile it, what I mean is that it did produce the (two?) needed *.a files -- I did not perform any tests to verify that the compiled code actually works correctly.\n\nSo I guess this boils down to two questions:\n- How do I compile it without SSL support\n- Is there any realistic hope for SSL-support within the next 3 months?\n\nThanks for your response.\n"
