I was not hoping that GRPC would have a default timeout. I was hoping that it would be possible for users to specify a default timeout either on the channel or on the client, in a consistent manner across languages. Edited the original comment"

    "body": "The forthcoming service config functionality (which we plan to make available by the end of Q1) will provide a way for service owners to publish default timeouts on a per-method basis (including setting a default for all methods of a given service).  That's not exactly the same thing as allowing the client to specify a default timeout for all RPCs, but I think it's actually a bit better suited to real-life use, since it's hard to imagine the same default timeout being appropriate for every single RPC."
