    "body": "The client-side keepalive mechanism is completely disjoint from grpclb.  The former is primarily about maintaining the health of the HTTP/2 connection between the client and the server, and since it's specific to that individual HTTP/2 connection, it can't really be used to communicate with the grpclb balancer, which uses a separate HTTP/2 connection.\r\n\r\nThat having been said, if your goal is to communicate server load information to your grpclb balancer, then the right way to do that is via server-side load reporting, which allows servers to communicate their load information directly to the balancer.  @AspirinSJL is currently working on an OSS implementation of this."

Thanks!"
