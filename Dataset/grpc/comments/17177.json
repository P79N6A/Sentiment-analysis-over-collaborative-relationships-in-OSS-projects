    "body": "Hey @gnossen !\r\nThis is an issue that I faced myself too (even started a discussion at [rules_python #125](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/125)). I suppose we can now confirm that rules_python **does** expect implicit dependencies to be stated explicitly (also reported at [#70](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/70), [#110](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/70)).\r\n\r\nAs it stands, I don't know of any _existing solution_ to this. A good start would be to look at [#90](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/pull/90) from the creator of [TriggerMail/rules_pyz - one of the other popular third-party projects that tries to solve some aspects of Bazel for Python](https://github.com/TriggerMail/rules_pyz). The PR was unfortunately not merged because it was only partially working."
