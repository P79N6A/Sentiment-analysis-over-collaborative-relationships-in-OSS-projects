    "body": "Hi @nevi-me, \nwe already use nghttpx on server side to have only one port open and route the requests to correct grpc server.\n\nProblem:\nWe would like to have several grpc servers with the same interface. That in a failed request we can use simply another. As failed request I see, 1. a grpc server absolutely not answer, because he is not alive or 2. a grpc server that dies while request.\n\nWe don't want to try/catch each made request in client. We would like to have some own wrapper/interceptor that hooks into the request and on fail sends it to the another server. Like a stub with several channels.\n\nHow to do that correctly? Like to make something looking like this (python example): \n\n``` python\nchannel = grpc.insecure_channel('172.10.100.1:50051')\nchannel2 = grpc.insecure_channel('172.10.100.2:50051')\nstub = helloworld_pb2.GreeterStub(channel, channel2)\n```\n\nIn use case 2 (server dies) a proxy is not quite well working. We need to retry the request, and thats only possible in client.\n"
