In the examples directory in tag release-0_11_1, [greeter_client.js](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/release-0_11_1/examples/node/greeter_client.js) and [greeter_server.js](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/release-0_11_1/examples/node/greeter_server.js) _already_ import grpc with `require('grpc')`.

If you just want to install the C code (which is used for other languages like Python, Ruby, etc.), then just do\n\n```\nmake static_c shared_c\nsudo make install_c # or sudo checkinstall make install_c\n```\n\nBut if you also want the C++ code, then do\n\n```\nmake\nsudo make install # or sudo checkinstall\n```\n"
