    "body": "When RR is used outside of gRPC LB, its `**user_data` argument to `pick()` is `NULL`. Which means that `*user_data` on the modified lines would result in a segmentation fault when it tried to dereference a `NULL` pointer. This was noticed by a failing `lb_policies_test`. The mystery is, why didn't that test fire as part of the PR that introduced the bug...\n"
