    "body": "As I see it, we've got three parts:\n1. Filedescriptor kick logic, including the locking to handle kick when there's no fd\n2. A file descriptor free list\n3. The mechanics of actually kicking/draining an FD.\n\n3 has basically no logic, and I firmly believe 1 and 2 should be shared. If anything I'd lean towards pulling the pipe logic out into its own separate file too (which is basically how things look in google3 -- WakeupFileDescriptor is basically the same thing as \"grpc_pollset_kick_vtable\") My guess is that multipolling (especially epoll) doesn't want the full fancy kick mechanism anyway.\n"
