The status codes are detailed in [this file](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/include/grpc/impl/codegen/status.h). It looks like you would want to use INVALID_ARGUMENT in this case. You can provide extra details in the status string, and if that's insufficient, you can also send custom trailing metadata with additional error information."
