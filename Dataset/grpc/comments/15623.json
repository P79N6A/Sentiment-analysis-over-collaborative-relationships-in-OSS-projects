    "body": "@jtattermusch \r\n\r\nHi Jan!\r\nYou mentioned building a retry interceptor. I was trying to make one but hit a snag. Trying to mark the AsyncUnaryCall interceptor override as async (so I can await the call and catch resulting errors) seems like it should work because AsyncUnaryCall implements GetAwaiter - but I get this error when building instead:\r\n\r\n      Error\tCS1983\tThe return type of an async method must be void, Task or Task<T>\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, this is because the class also needs to have an AsyncMethodBuilder specified. Is this something that just needs fixing, or is there some other way to achieve what I want via interceptors? (be able to catch the error, inspect it for retry-ableness, and retry or fail accordingly)?\r\n\r\nAnd as a side question, will this future retry layer handle \"GOAWAY received\" errors? "

Additional information would be helpful from those able to reproduce:\r\n- please include there exact exception thrown (this issue is only about \"StatusCode=Unknown Detail=\"Stream removed\")\r\n- the flakiness rate you are observing (it looks like this is happening only occasionally)\r\n- is your use case accessing Google APIs or are you accessing your own server (in case it's your own server, please include info about network topology, is there a proxy?). Are you using a plain gRPC library or a google api client library built on top of gRPC?\r\n- what's your platform (it seems like this might be happening mostly with Windows 10 clients, but the data is very unclear).\r\n- what is gRPC C# version you are using?\r\n- when possible, please include additional trace logs (see https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for instructions."
