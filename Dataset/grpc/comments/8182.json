    "body": "I definitely agree with expanding on comments and checking to make sure that gRPC submodules were succesfully cloned. As for checking whether they are cloned locally vs via network, I think checking Jenkins logs with timestamps enabled will show which method was used. \n\nIn regards to reducing complexity: I did more research and testing, and I believe that \"git submodule foreach\" does nothing unless the submodules are already cloned. My idea to reduce complexity is to create an external repo for just submodules and to reference this when cloning submodules. This way, it is much more obvious what is happening in the scripts. Let me know what you think. \n"
