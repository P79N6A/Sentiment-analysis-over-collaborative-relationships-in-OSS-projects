My money is at or around https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/14170.\r\n\r\nBy the way, in your server.cc file, on line 69, you have:\r\n```\r\nstd::string address = \"0.0.0.0:\" + std::string(argv[0]);\r\n```\r\nI'm guessing you meant to write:\r\n```\r\nstd::string address = \"0.0.0.0:\" + std::string(argv[i]);\r\n```\r\nOtherwise, you only use the first port passed in as arg. Is this a typo in the repro code only or have you been testing with this -from the looks of it- buggy line?"
