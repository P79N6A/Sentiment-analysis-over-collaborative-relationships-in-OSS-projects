    "body": "Note that this'll mean users who want to install `grpcio-health-checking` from the source distribution via `pip` from PyPI will be forced to install `grpcio-tools` first unless we put in some import-this-tool-only-if-we-need-to-generate-the-protos logic and always distribute `sdist`s with pre-generated `pb2`s. `pip` can't grab `setup_requires` automatically since it doesn't play nicely with the feature (it `egg_info`s first, which will choke on a naive import of `grpc.tools.command` without `grpcio-tools` installed).\n\nI think we're okay with that because our primary means of distribution will always be wheels, and `sdist`s will always be second-class citizens for devheads on unusual systems; just making that explicit here.\n"
