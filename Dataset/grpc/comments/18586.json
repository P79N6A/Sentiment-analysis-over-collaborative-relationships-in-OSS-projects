Given that the registration would be a one time thing compared to parsing which would happen more often, I don't see a reason to use a UniquePtr to avoid a simple copy which in this case should be something of a no-op since parsers would not have any state to them. Having a UniquePtr would just mean a layer of indirection everytime we want to parse service configs. "
