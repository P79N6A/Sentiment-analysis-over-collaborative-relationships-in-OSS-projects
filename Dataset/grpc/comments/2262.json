libprotobuf might solve my problem but it will create more problems. Still, I continued with:\r\n\r\n`sudo dpkg --remove --force-depends libprotobuf9v5 libprotobuf-lite9v5`\r\n\r\nNow, I tried to run my gtk3 + grpc app, but I got an error. And I can reproduce the error by importing gtk3 in python shell like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> import gi\r\n>>> gi.require_version('Gtk', '3.0')\r\n>>> from gi.repository import Gtk as gtk\r\n```\r\n\r\nI got:\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/opt/crystal/venv/panel/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gi/importer.py\", line 145, in load_module\r\n    importlib.import_module('gi.repository.' + dep.split(\"-\")[0])\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/importlib/__init__.py\", line 37, in import_module\r\n    __import__(name)\r\n  File \"/opt/crystal/venv/panel/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gi/importer.py\", line 146, in load_module\r\n    dynamic_module = load_overrides(introspection_module)\r\n  File \"/opt/crystal/venv/panel/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gi/overrides/__init__.py\", line 125, in load_overrides\r\n    override_mod = importlib.import_module(override_package_name)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/importlib/__init__.py\", line 37, in import_module\r\n    __import__(name)\r\n  File \"/opt/crystal/venv/panel/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gi/overrides/Gdk.py\", line 80, in <module>\r\n    Color = override(Color)\r\n  File \"/opt/crystal/venv/panel/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/gi/overrides/__init__.py\", line 206, in override\r\n    assert g_type != TYPE_NONE\r\nAssertionError\r\n```\r\nI ended up reinstalling libprotobuf9v5 libprotobuf-lite9v5 and check around in github. Anyone have any ideas?"
