Is there a reason why protoc.exe outputs in a different format for msvs?\r\nAFAICT, both GCC and MSVS option should output the same line and column number: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/compiler/command_line_interface.cc#L342. The CS1001 seems to be coming from the C# compiler, not from the protoc compiler.\r\n\r\n> 2. Warnings do not specify location in the file. For example: `../Protos/greet.proto: warning: Import google/protobuf/empty.proto but not used.` Why is the location information missing? I've defaulted the link to the beginning of the file but I feel this information should be available from protoc.exe and it should be updated.\r\n> 3. Sometimes errors also don't specify location. For example: `../Protos/greet.proto: Import \"google/protobuf/empty.proto\" was listed twice.` Again, I've defaulted the link to the beginning of the file but I feel this information should be available from protoc.exe and it should be updated.\r\n- Unfortunately, some of the errors happen at final semantic validation time, not at parsing time, and we have lost the source code location there: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.cc#L4161. It will take a good deal of refactoring to propagate that all the way through. We do a pretty bad job at preserving the source code location at semantic validation time currently :(\r\n\r\n> 4. Does protoc.exe ever write anything other than errors and warnings to standard output or standard error?\r\n- Not that I am aware of.\r\n\r\n> 5. Do errors and warnings ever use a different format than the ones I've listed?\r\n- GCC and MSVS are the only ErrorFormat that we support: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/compiler/command_line_interface.h#L383\r\n"

This was introduced back in 2009 by external contribution. It was before we even moved to Github, so the context was basically gone.

We don't have the concept of an error/warning code though, but we should be able to output the line and column in the correct format.
