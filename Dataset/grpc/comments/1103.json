    "body": "Thanks for reporting. We discussed on this before but did not add a guard,\nand the new AsyncNext method makes it more serious. I will fix it.\n\nOn Fri, Mar 20, 2015 at 9:43 AM, Andrey Myznikov notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Hello Folks,\n> It seems there is a bug in system_clock::time_point to gpr_timespec\n> conversion in grpc.\n> Particularly in Timepoint2Timespec() (src/cpp/util/time.cc::51) , we have\n> this line:\n> to->tv_sec = secs.count().\n> \n> The problem is that secs.count() has type int64_t, but\n> gpr_timespec::tv_sec is declared as time_t, usually a typedef for 'long\n> int'.\n> \n> The bug leads to run-time errors when running on 32-bit machines or under\n> ARMv7, when 'long int' is less than int64_t.\n> \n> For example, the CompletionQueue::Next() specifies\n> std::chrono::system_clock::time_point::max() as deadline, but this is much\n> larger than available value of gpr_inf_future.tv_sec:\n> \n> deadline.count()=9223372036854775807\n> secs.count()=9223372036\n> nsecs.count()=854775807\n> \n> Leads to:\n> to->tv_sec=633437444\n> to->tv_nsec=854775807\n> \n> As result we have absolutelly incorrect behavior of gpr_cv_wait() from\n> sync_posix.c.\n> \n> Fix it please!\n> \n> â€”\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/1103.\n"
