Everything is all good there.\n\n:confused: The bad news is that it appears that one or more commits were authored by someone other than the pull request submitter.  We need to confirm that they're okay with their commits being contributed to this project.  Please have them confirm that here in the pull request.\n\n*Note to project maintainer: This is a terminal state, meaning the `cla/google` commit status will not change from this State.
