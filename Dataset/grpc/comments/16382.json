    "body": "Was able to link the libraries dynamically at last, one have to use the .so present in /usr/local/include and for protobuf there would be protobuf.a file which you can change to .so by using `ar command`. And compile the codes using these .so file. Build the executable and you are good to go. \r\n\r\nClosing this issue. If any explanation needed feel free to open."
