    "body": "Hi, @robertwb . This is an awesome contribution! Just a couple of things:\r\n\r\n- This PR currently has some [failing unit tests.](https://source.cloud.google.com/results/invocations/0b27b539-b7f3-45b1-9242-893dc1544d03/targets/grpc%2Fcore%2Fpull_request%2Flinux%2Fgrpc_python_bazel_test/log)\r\n- We need to add some unit tests to cover this behavior.\r\n- Since this changes the public API, we'll need to modify the docstrings for [`StreamUnaryMultiCallable`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/618a3f561d4a93f263cca23abad086ed8f4d5e86/src/python/grpcio/grpc/framework/interfaces/face/face.py#L495) and [`StreamStreamMultiCallable`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/618a3f561d4a93f263cca23abad086ed8f4d5e86/src/python/grpcio/grpc/framework/interfaces/face/face.py#L563), so the change is reflected in the API docs on [grpc.io](https://grpc.io)."
