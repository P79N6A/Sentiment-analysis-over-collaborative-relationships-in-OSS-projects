    "body": "Let me anticipate a counter-argument\r\n\r\n@vjpai, You claim that \"OWNERS adds constraints beyond what we're used to internally,\" but the gRFC process already does that to us and you've been an advocate for its expansion. How do you reconcile those arguments?\r\n\r\nMy response: The gRFC process exists because we and all our users don't exist in a [mono-repo](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext) in the OSS world. As a result, we can't make changes and test their behavior across all possible targets. This is particularly true for [core](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/444b7030b19f634e650c5d16ffcd421ad585d53c/P3-grfcs-for-core-api-changes.md) where we actually allow ourselves to make breaking changes (since it's a semantically-versioned public API meant for library implementers, not a stable public API meant for application developers). Additionally, the common thread here is product excellence. Facilitating rapid code cleanups and rapid reverts of buggy or destabilizing code improves product excellence. Facilitating rapid API growth and/or breakage degrades product excellence."
