    "body": "First, let me clarify, but BoringSSL isn't just for internal use at Google. This is an actual, public, official replacement of OpenSSL provided by Google.\r\n\r\nThat being said, its usage within gRPC is fully optional. In fact, the Makefile will not try to build and use it unless it really have to. Long story short, it means you don't have a suitable replacement for it on your system, aka, OpenSSL 1.0.2+.\r\n\r\nIf you do `make run_dep_checks`, it'll show you what commands it's running for the various detections. If it detects you have the `pkg-config` tool, it's going to try running `pkg-config --atleast-version=1.0.2`, and will happily use the results of `pkg-config` if it finds something appropriate. If you don't have the `pkg-config` tool, it'll try compiling a dummy executable that'll make use of the necessary APIs we require from OpenSSL. So, on a system that has the development libraries for OpenSSL 1.0.2+, no BoringSSL compilation takes places:\r\n\r\n```\r\n:~/sources/grpc (master)$ make -j 8 |& grep -i boringssl\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we do not detect an appropriate version of OpenSSL on the system, the Makefile will define `EMBED_OPENSSL` to true, and will build something on the fly. You can override this behavior (and most likely you will get an error later since we didn't detect an appropriate version of OpenSSL) by doing `EMBED_OPENSSL=false make`.\r\n\r\nAs for `stdalign.h`, if your gcc 4.9.4 doesn't have it, you can't just try using the one from your clang 3.4.2. That's not how standard headers work. You'd need to _use_ your clang 3.4.2 compiler from your system to get that header properly. You can override which compiler the `Makefile` uses by using the very classic `CC` and `CXX` variables."

I meant no disrespect.\r\n\r\nThe machine we are trying to use has OpenSSL at 1.0.1.\r\n\r\nWe might prefer to build 1.0.2 in a private area, and just \"point to it,\" but that brings up three questions:\r\n\r\n(1) from my limited viewing of the large gRPC Makefile, it appears that it won't be easy to convince the build process to find the include and lib files in someplace other than /usr/local/ssl, and since it's not \"fully installed\" the \"pkg-config\" tool won't find it anyway, so is this a fool's errand?\r\n\r\n(2) Are you requiring version 1.0.2 because gRPC must have ALPN rather than NPN? Or is there some way to actually get gRPC to compile with OpenSSL 1.0.1?\r\n\r\n(3) Is it possible that even if we do properly install OpenSSL 1.0.2, something about the basic system may still be stuck at \"NPN\" and not properly upgrade to \"ALPN\" so we will find more problems down this path?"
