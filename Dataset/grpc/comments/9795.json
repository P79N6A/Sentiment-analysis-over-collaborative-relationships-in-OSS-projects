    "body": "So, as a matter of pushback: my concern is that we can't know what the user wants. We could catch and exception and give some kind of status code, but it's not likely that it's what the user actually wants. For example, I think that INTERNAL is likely not appropriate in the above; maybe it should really be RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED or UNAVAILABLE or something else depending on what the user code is actually trying to do when it has its exception. And the latter is something that the user knows far better than we ever will. So I'm going to suggest leaving this behavior as is in the stock gRPC C++ sync server implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
