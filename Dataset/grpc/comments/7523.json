    "body": "I really don't see the point of 57cc8f8 . Why isn't this a submodule? I don't think we should carry it around like this - better to make it a submodule pinned at a specific commit and then we can only take it when we want to. I wasn't opposed to it being a submodule - I was opposed to chedeti/thrift.git being the submodule. Let it be a submodule of the actual thrift repo pinned at a specific commit and then just check in your changes. Bringing their entire repo into ours is going to make maintainability impossible.\n"
