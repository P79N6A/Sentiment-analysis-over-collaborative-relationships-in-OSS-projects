    "body": "Forgive the long comment -- I got all geeky on this...\n\nIt looks like PIP does alphabetical sorting rather than using `distutils.version` sorting. This shows up as (not rendering as code here so you can see everything without scrolling):\n\n$ sudo pip install grpcio\nDownloading/unpacking grpcio\n  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement grpcio (from versions: 0.10.0a0, 0.11.0b0, 0.11.0b1, 0.4.0a0, 0.4.0a1, 0.4.0a13, 0.4.0a14, 0.4.0a2, 0.4.0a3, 0.4.0a4, 0.4.0a5, 0.4.0a6, 0.4.0a7, 0.4.0a8, 0.5.0a0, 0.5.0a1, 0.5.0a2, 0.9.0a0, 0.9.0a1)\nCleaning up...\n\nNote that the last one in the list is `0.9.0a1`, but the \"most recent\" (if PIP was sorting based on `distutils.version`) would be `0.11.0b1`. I figure the last one is the highest number (I see it's certainly bigger than `0.5.0a2`...) so I just go with that, which then leads me to compile errors.\n\n**We can't fix how PIP does things in the scope of this issue, but we can set a default version so that this choice isn't required...**\n\n---\n\nIf you're interested, it looks like PIP is just calling `sorted` on the versions when showing you the list of available options, but that isn't really how versions should be sorted.\n\nFor example, let's say we have versions: `0.1, 0.9, 0.11b1, 1.0`\n\nPIP sorted (note that it's just saying \"let's sort the strings\")\n\n``` python\n>>> versions = ['0.1', '0.9', '0.11b1', '1.0', '0.5']\n>>> sorted(versions)\n['0.1', '0.11b1', '0.5', '0.9', '1.0']\n```\n\nWhat we expect here is what `distutils.version` provides, where we're treating each \"section\" (separated by dots) as it's own piece:\n\n``` python\n>>> from distutils.version import StrictVersion\n>>> versions = ['0.1', '0.9', '0.11', '1.0', '0.5']\n>>> print map(str, sorted(map(StrictVersion, versions)))\n['0.1', '0.5', '0.9', '0.11b1', '1.0']\n```\n\nIn other words, PIP is sorting in a way that treats version `0.5` and `0.50` as the same thing, whereas most versions treat `0.5` and `0.50` numerically as comparing `0.05` and `0.50` (and read it as \"oh dot five\" and \"oh dot fifty\")\n"
