They are not failures on synchronous stream read/finish (which point to timeouts). Rather, they are complaints about too many CQ ops, which I haven't seen before on this test, and they're coming along right at the beginning of the test. I do think that this merits exploration to see if this was a side-effect of the changed timer handling.\n"
