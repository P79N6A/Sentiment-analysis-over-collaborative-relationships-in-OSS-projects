    "body": "@hsaliak Thanks for reaching out on twitter. I ended up setting it to the same number as the `pool_keep_alive`, and while that helped, we're still seeing some load balancing issues. We're hoping a slower deployment speed will help here.\r\n\r\nWe also saw some segfaults on 1.18.0 during shutdown, which I will file and issue for once if I can reproduce. Moving back down to 1.16.0 did solve that. \r\n\r\nWe've been experimenting on and off with gRPC ruby for some time, and we've hit a lot of little hiccups along the way. We love the tooling, but the transport (aws + http2 aren't great friends), and little issues like these make it harder to advocate for. With that said, I'd love to help make things better!"
