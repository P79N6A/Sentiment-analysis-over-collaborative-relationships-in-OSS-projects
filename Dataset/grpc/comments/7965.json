There is a boatload of bugs that were fixed between 0.11 and 1.0, so remembering and finding the exact cause of what you're experiencing here isn't going to be possible for us. Sorry, but we won't be able to provide support for past beta releases of gRPC. Or was it even alpha ? I don't remember...\n"
