    "body": "Let me try and think of another way to word this...\n\nOkay, the grpc binary packages have a set of dependencies. These are mostly calculated automatically at build time. For additional explicit dependencies, they're normally unversioned unless there's a particular reason to declare an explicit version (and that will then impact on installability based on which distributions that explicit versioned dependency can be satisfied on).\n\nHere's a snippet from debian/control:\n\n```\nPackage: libgrpc-dev\nDepends: libgrpc0 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}\n\nPackage: libgrpc0\nDepends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}\n```\n\nWhen the package gets built (in unstable, because that's the entry point for packages), this gets expanded by debhelper out to be\n\n```\nPackage: libgrpc-dev\nDepends: libgrpc0 (= 0.10.2-2)\n\nPackage: libgrpc0\nDepends: libc6 (>= 2.17), libgoogle-perftools4, libssl1.0.0 (>= 1.0.2~beta3), zlib1g (>= 1:1.1.4)\n```\n\nSo in terms of when the package can and will transition from unstable to testing, it depends on a few factors:\n\n1) No new release-critical severity bugs were opened against it whilst it was in unstable\n2) The \"urgency\" of the upload (set in the changelog, normally set to low == 10 days)\n3) The availability of all of its dependencies in testing\n\nSo you can see here that libgrpc0 has a few additional dependencies. You can check on what versions are available in testing with the rmadison tool:\n\n```\n$ rmadison -u debian -s testing libc6 libgoogle-perftools4 libssl1.0.0 zlib1g\ndebian:\n libc6                | 2.19-19           | stretch | amd64, arm64, armel, armhf, i386, mips, mipsel, powerpc, ppc64el, s390x\n libgoogle-perftools4 | 2.2.1-0.2         | stretch | amd64, arm64, armel, armhf, i386, powerpc, ppc64el\n libssl1.0.0          | 1.0.2d-1          | stretch | amd64, arm64, armel, armhf, i386, mips, mipsel, powerpc, ppc64el, s390x\n zlib1g               | 1:1.2.8.dfsg-2+b1 | stretch | amd64, arm64, armel, armhf, i386, mips, mipsel, powerpc, ppc64el, s390x\n```\n\nSo you can see here that all of the versions are >= than the dependencies declared, so only criteria 1 and 2 above will apply to the timing of the package transitioning into testing.\n\nPractically, a more holistic package overview is available at http://packages.qa.debian.org/grpc\n"
