We are tackling a number of non-gevent issues right now, and the team member who wrote our gevent compatible code is no longer on the team, so it will likely be sometime next month before we can follow-up in detail with this bug report - there have been other recent issues reported with our gevent integration that we will also be sorting out.\r\n\r\nFrom initial searching, it wasn't clear to me that requests is compatible with gevent, given the existence of the grequests package. If you have a pointer to documentation about this that would be helpful."
