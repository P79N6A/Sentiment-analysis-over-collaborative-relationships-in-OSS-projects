    "body": "Hi there,\r\nIn the future, let me suggest that (as stated in the issue template), this is the sort of question that is better suited for the grpc-io mailing list as it's a question about library implementation rather than a bug report or feature request.\r\nThe gRPC core doesn't promise to do the (potentially blocking) network activity for RPCs unless it knows that that work is being waited on by a Next. This is to avoid the need to use library-owned threads just to push the network activity further; instead, the core can use the application threads to push the work along each time they call Next. The C++ API is just a thin wrapping around the core, and it also makes no promises about when the network activity actually starts, just that the Next/AsyncNext operations will actually catch the result of a completed tagged operation.\r\nHope that helps!\r\n "
