    "body": "The issue was that _grpc_call_stack_destroy_ was being called before _gpr_free_ was called on \r\n_c->final_info.error_string_. \r\n\r\nA closure called release_call is scheduled right after _grpc_call_stack_destroy_. This closure frees up the memory allocated for the call. The call to _gpr_free_ on the error_string (which can happen after the release) requires a read for the value of the error_string pointer, which is the heap-use-after-free bug being complained about."
