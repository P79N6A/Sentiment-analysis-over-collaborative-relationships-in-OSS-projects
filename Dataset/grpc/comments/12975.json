    "body": "It's been a while, but I think the best reasonable option is to disable the explicit use of set_buffer_hint in the sync API. The reason is that the sync API is based on the idea that a Write is committed (and the next Write can be sent) when this Write finishes. This is not actually true for buffered writes: we could either wait for it to truly be committed (defeating the point of buffering) or force some other synchronization mechanism to exist to prevent the next Write (removing the benefit of the sync API). This is why we've only activated and tested the use of this option on last messages here. I will probably make a PR to do this soon."
