    "body": "Reasons why not to use port server for C#:\r\n- port server is useful for more sophisticated scenarios when one needs to reserve a port and e.g. start the server after starting a client (C core tests are doing that in some scenarios). But C# tests don't need that and port_server is just another dependency. I'd love for C# tests to work well when run standalone rather then depending on our custom port server (you can run NUnit tests separately without using run_tests.py)\r\n- grpc_pick_unused_port is part of grpc_test_util  so it's troublesome to make it accessible from grpc_csharp_ext (which should only depend on grpc and nothing else).\r\n- grpc_pick_unused_port actually registers an atexit() handler that releases all previously allocated ports. That atexit() handle is incompatible with C# runtime (it crashes).\r\n- one could implement a native C# port server client quite easily, but after allocating ports, one needs to release them too and that's extra code and is not guaranteed to work (and I really don't want to make port server run out of ports by missing something). Let's not do that unless we really have to.\r\n- overall, C# doesn't really need port server and introducing it would be unnecessary dependency and more hassle with no extra benefit.\r\n"
