    "body": "@gnossen @lidizheng `unittest` doesn't have great support for parameterizing tests, as far as I could determine. Some tests in `_rpc_test.py` and `_health_servicer_test.py` needed to be parameterized, and I went with two different approaches: manually refactoring the shared behavior into helper method (`_rpc_test.py`) versus subclassing a new class (`_health_servicer_test.py`). Looking at it now, I think I prefer the `_health_servicer_test` approach; if you agree I'll update the `_rpc_test` file to use the same approach."
