    "body": "We don't know much about Anaconda and don't run continuous tests and therefore may not fully support Anaconda installs, but generally things have been fine and users have been successful using gRPC when they install it via `conda install` as opposed to `pip install`. \r\n\r\nWith all that, the error message `Import grpc:No module named coros` is very strange as I searched the entire code base for the identifier `coros` and it does not appear in our codebase, so I am inclined to say something is going on in the machine configuration."
