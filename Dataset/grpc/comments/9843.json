    "body": "From offline conversation with @murgatroid99:\r\nme:\r\n\r\n> I noticed a couple failures when building with GRPC_UV defined--it looks like some issue with libpthread not being present.  AIUI, libuv is an alternative networking API to posix or windows sockets, and the socket factory abstraction added by my pull request only makes sense for posix sockets.  Should I scope src/core/lib/iomgr/socket_factory.[hc] to only expand to anything if GRPC_POSIX_SOCKET is #defined, and if so, does that mean these files should actually be named socket_factory_posix.[hc]?\r\n\r\n@murgatroid99:\r\n\r\n> There are a few things that should change there. First, the immediate cause of those compilation errors is that you are including sockaddr.h in socket_factory.h. Libuv can cause some import order problems, and the result of that is that sockaddr.h should be first in any list of included headers, and it should not be transitively included via other headers. Because of this, struct sockaddr should not be used in public or internal gRPC APIs. Instead, you should use the struct grpc_resolved_address, which is defined in resolve_address.h. The functions defined in sockaddr_utils.h allow for performing many operations on that type without accessing the underlying struct sockaddr.\r\n\r\n> In addition, if the functionality is in fact specific to POSIX sockets, then the .c file should be enclosed in #ifdef GRPC_POSIX_SOCKET. I think we don't do that for .h files, under the assumption that platform-specific header files will only be included in corresponding platform-specific source files. Changing the name to socket_factory_posix.[ch] probably does make sense here. I can't comment on the names of the udp_server files; I wasn't involved in choosing them.\r\n \r\n\r\n"
