    "body": "I figured out the problem, I was using [Certstrap](https://github.com/square/certstrap) to generate the certificate but looked over a fine detail, turns out that for self signed certificate issuer domain name must match its subject domain name [rfc5280](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-3.2). So I did exactly that and everything worked. \r\n```\r\nSelf-issued certificates are CA certificates in which\r\nthe issuer and subject are the same entity.  Self-issued certificates\r\nare generated to support changes in policy or operations.  Self-\r\nsigned certificates are self-issued certificates where the digital\r\nsignature may be verified by the public key bound into the\r\ncertificate.  Self-signed certificates are used to convey a public\r\nkey for use to begin certification paths.  End entity certificates\r\nare issued to subjects that are not authorized to issue certificates.\r\n```\r\nWeird how go client worked without it though."
