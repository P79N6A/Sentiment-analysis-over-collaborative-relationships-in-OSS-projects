    "body": "From the compile log, the command executed [here](https://github.com/gaoshun/errorlog/blob/master/make.log#L1836) is \"false\", which indicates the linker or some other command isn't being produced correctly by your buildtool.\r\n\r\nI hadn't heard of buildroot (https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#_infrastructure_for_python_packages) prior to this question, and I don't think anyone on gRPC team has expertise on building python via buildroot. The grpc-io mailing list would be a more appropriate place to ask this question, and it's likely to be seen by a broader audience who might be able to help: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/grpc-io"
