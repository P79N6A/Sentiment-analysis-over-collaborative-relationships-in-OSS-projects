It has to hold on to the mutex while calling the other side since it has also used the current value one of its shared variables that is being updated as a result of this call. The queuing of the 5th request causes the lock to never be released, and deadlock has arisen.\n"

One thing that made it harder to diagnose is the fact that the string ResourceExhausted does not appear in this issue, so this issue does not float up in GitHub's issue search! So this is why I am saying ResourceExhausted here a few times, to aid discoverability. :)"
