Since you're already compiling these for those language packages, that means the build process for released binaries is there as well for some of the other languages.\r\n\r\nThis would be hugely helpful, as at least speaking for myself, I've been hacking around the fact that there are no pre-compiled binaries for years, and I'm sure others have been too (see above).

This is a pretty common use case, including for integration testing. I think there's pretty bountiful evidence that a lot of people want this https://github.com/search?l=Makefile&q=grpc%2Fgrpc+make+plugins&type=Code and this would be very useful.
