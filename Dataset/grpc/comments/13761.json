    "body": "\"I haven't tried to see if this is possible with cmake.\" What do you mean by \"this?\" Are you referring to the ability to set options? Are you asking if there is a preconfigured option in gRPC?\r\n\r\nThe issue I have with this request in the first place is that it asks for two very different things in one issue. My focus here will only be about the idea of making a standalone makefile. Make on its own is rarely used for projects with more than a few directories/build targets. For large projects supporting many platforms, you will usually see the use of makefile generators that generate platform-specific makefiles. autotools is still the dominant makefile generator, but CMake is growing in numbers. From what I know, bazel does not generate makefiles, but does the entire build from start to finish.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use makefiles to build gRPC in order to avoid installing cmake or bazel on a given platform, you might be able to use CMake to help you generate the makefile, but I am honestly not sure and would not suggest it."
