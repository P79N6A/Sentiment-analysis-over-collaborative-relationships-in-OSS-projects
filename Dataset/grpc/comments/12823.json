    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nIn our current framework, we use reconfiguration for a number of reasons. For example, if your ssl cert is going to expire soon, you can reconfigure the cert without taking down the instance.\r\n\r\nIt is also useful sometimes to adjust the maximum number of connections that a server is permitted to have (grpc currently does not allow limiting the max connections and it's a feature request that is pending - https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/12472).\r\n\r\nI was looking at the grpc_types.h and some options like enabling census reporting etc. might be useful to toggle. \r\n\r\nThanks,  "

That was the big factor. \r\n\r\nOur environment does support restarting individual servers in a non-impacting fashion and there are ways to handle other stuff. The configuration reload stuff predates these newer capabilities by a considerable duration so that stuff is still around.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I don't have a good use case now for reconfiguration support so I'll go ahead and close the issue.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time.
