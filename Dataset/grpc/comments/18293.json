Transport security is very flexible - you would need to create a type that implements [credentials.TransportCredentials](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc/credentials#TransportCredentials) and pass that to your clients and servers using [grpc.WithTransportCreds](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc#WithTransportCredentials) and [grpc.Creds](https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc#Creds).  The client and server handshakers are passed the raw network connection and give back a `net.Conn` whose `Read` and `Write` methods are overridden to decrypt/encrypt as appropriate around those operations on the underlying connection.  Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns or if you run into any problems with implementation."
