    "body": "@sheenaqotj : Sure, I hear you. There's a potentially more straightforward way to do this without introducing a new lock (and I've been trying not to introduce locks as a result of the callback API). Let's have another refcount that starts at 2. It gets subtracted by 1 when OnStarted is done and by 1 when an OnCancel is needed. If the refcount hits 0, then OnCancel actually gets called. (If it never hits 0, that means that an OnCancel was not actually needed.) Refcounts are considered a kosher special case of atomics, and I think it would be more comprehensible and easier to maintain than this. @soheilhy : what do you think of that suggestion?\r\n"
