    "body": "I'm using gRPC in production, and I've made react-native binding for gRPC. To implement some features like hostnameOverride, we have to modify some code in gRPC-Objc.\r\nI don't think the gRPC-Objc is production ready.\r\n\r\n## GRPCChannel\r\nThe GRPCChannel and GRPCHost are private. I think it would be better if we can create a GRPCChannel like grpc-java, with ability to manage state of the channel and customize the channel arguments.\r\n### Channel arguments\r\nI found some hardcoded channel args and have no way to change externally, See https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/ed64818520f2b4b8d47ce14abbd656505a2b6ef1/src/objective-c/GRPCClient/private/GRPCHost.m#L238.\r\n\r\nIf we wanna to create an insecure connection, we have to import `GRPCCall+Tests.h` and call `[GRPCCall useInsecureConnectionsForHost:host]` before we make the call. To revert that, we need to call `[GRPCCall resetHostSettings]`, and it will reset all host settings and close all connections.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is no way to set timeout and hostnameOverride, see https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/9555.\r\n### Manage state of channel\r\nThere is no way to shutdown specify channel. If we want to shutdown a channel, we must shutdown all channels:\r\n```\r\n// internally called [GRPCHost flushChannelCache] to disconnect all connections.\r\n[GRPCCall closeOpenConnections];\r\n```\r\n## GRPCCall\r\n### Call options\r\nThe deadline hard coded to infinity in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/46357c882df1afc28f7a5228c40fde522093fa32/src/objective-c/GRPCClient/private/GRPCChannel.m#L200. We need an external timer to cancel the call.\r\n### Misc\r\nI think it would be better add more callback like onHeaders.\r\n"
