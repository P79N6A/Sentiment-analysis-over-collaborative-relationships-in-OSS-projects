Check [your existing CLA data](https://cla.developers.google.com/clas) and verify that your [email is set on your git commits](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/).\n- If your company signed a CLA, they designated a Point of Contact who decides which employees are authorized to participate. You may need to contact the Point of Contact for your company and ask to be added to the group of authorized contributors.
