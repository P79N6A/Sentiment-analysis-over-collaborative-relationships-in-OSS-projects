    "body": "I don't think this is an actual memory leak. I set up a loop that creates these Client objects and then discards the reference. If some of the memory involved in the construction of those objects was leaking, I would expect unbounded memory usage growth, but `top` indicates that memory usage actually quickly levels off. I actually see the resident memory grow slowly and then drop when garbage is collected, all within fixed bounds, which is exactly what I would expect to see if everything is getting cleaned up correctly.\n\nWhat you are seeing may simply be an artifact of the C or C++ level memory allocator.\n"

I haven't been able to reproduce outside of the sample repo.\n\n@pierre-b, I'll close this issue, but if you can track this down in a grpc-only environment, feel free to reply and we'll keep working on it. And thank you for the report to begin with. It led to some great discussions!\n"
