    "body": "@imiuka, thanks for the pull request. I think the change you are suggesting is a step in right direction - and I agree with the resulting behavior in the situation in question. Unfortunately, the change needs to be a bit more complicated than that. \n\nWith your version of the change, you are artificially emitting the StatusCode.Unavailable, which is not necessarily the status code with which the RPC is going to finish - there are other error statuses that you can obtain in described situation. Also, you need to guarantee that once you receive StatusCode.Unavailable from an attempted stream write, you will also receive the same status after awaiting other operations on the same call (e.g. a streaming read or unary response) - there should really be one and only one StatusCode for each remote call.\n\nSo, the problem you are describing is real and we need to fix it - but in a different way. I think issue #7223 describes the problem really well, so if you don't mind, I will continue the discussion on this topic there. I will also close this PR for now with a promise to work on this issue in the nearest future.\n"
