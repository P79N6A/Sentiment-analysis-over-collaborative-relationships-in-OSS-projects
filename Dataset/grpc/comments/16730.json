    "body": "@manuurdevang the strange thing that pops out here is that you seem to be using the one of the pre-compiled `x86_64` grpc packages on what looks like a 32 bit architecture.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering how the `x86_64` grpc package was downloaded here in the first place. Normally, the package manager should be fetch the 32-bit pre-compiled grpc package when it recognizes that it's installing for a 32-bit platform.\r\n\r\nOne more thing I'm wondering, can you please run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ irb\r\nirb> RUBY_PLATFORM\r\n```\r\n\r\nand share the output here? thanks"
