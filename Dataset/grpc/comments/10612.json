The problem with that is that, most of the time, it's OK and desirable to retry the former case, while it makes no sense in the latter. Unless responses vary between identical calls, if a message is too large the first time, it'll be too large on every retry, too. And because we're talking about >4MB in the default case, this will result each time in quite a waste of cycles, memory and bandwidth.\r\nI suppose it is too late now for any changes. Is it recommended for clients that care simply to hard code a check against the error string that is used by the gRPC implementation they rely on?"
