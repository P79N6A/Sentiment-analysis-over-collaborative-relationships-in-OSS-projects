    "body": "The error you are seeing is slightly misleading. The file simply does not exist. For that version of gRPC we separated the binaries for glibc and musl (Alpine) because people were reporting issues with trying to run the glibc binary on Alpine. But we did not actually publish the Alpine binaries until grpc 1.8.0.\r\n\r\nWhenever the precompiled binary isn't present, the installation should simply fall back to building from source, but unfortunately the base Alpine images don't come with the necessary tools to do so. You would need to install the `python` and `build-base` packages to build from source."
