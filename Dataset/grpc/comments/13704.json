    "body": "Python interceptor facility was just shipped with the 1.8.0 release. I think this should basically handle your use case. In fact there is an example that adds a header to every call (it adds a constant header, but it should be trivial to modify it to call a callback and append a context-sensitive header value):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/examples/python/interceptors/headers/greeter_client.py#L26\r\n\r\nI'm closing this issue, but please let me know if the interceptor solution is not satisfactory to you and I'll reopen. Cheers!"
