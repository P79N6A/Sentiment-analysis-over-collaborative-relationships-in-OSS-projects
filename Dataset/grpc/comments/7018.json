    "body": "Thanks for putting this together!\n\nTwo main concerns:\n1. We'd really like to be able to have one base class (ServiceName::FCService or something?) which has all unary methods as FCUnary, and also has streaming methods. With the current PR, we'd have to make ~15 classes in order to flow control every method. That by itself seems kind of messy, but instantiation of our service impl would be messy as well, since we'd have to wrap 15 times.\n2. Wouldn't it make sense for FCUnary to inherit from ServerReaderWriter? We envision writing some helper code that works for both streaming and unary, and if it at least inherited from ServerReaderWriter interface, that would make it easier.\n\nI'll try patching this and start experimenting with it.\n"

    "body": "It's been a while, but I now agree with you wrt this inheriting from ServerReaderWriter. It is a special-case of streaming that only allows exactly 1 Read and exactly 1 Write in that order, but that still merits considering it as though it were streaming. Will also get that other typedef in soon.\n"
