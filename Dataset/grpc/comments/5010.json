    "body": "Yes, I realize that this won't have an impact on core limits in the case of JS. The issue is that the driver needs to be able to ask how many cores are on the machine that the test is running on, though, in case the test is multilingual and there is a desire to limit the cores available to another test. For example if both a JS worker and a C++ worker are running on the same box and the driver wants to limit the client to a certain number of cores, it will ask whichever worker is first in the QPS_WORKERS list to give it the core count and then will adjust accordingly. The driver, after all, doesn't know which worker can understand which set of scenarios or RPCs. Does that make sense? It would also, in this case, send the repeated field specifying the core list to the JS worker, but it's ok if the JS worker ignores it.\n"
