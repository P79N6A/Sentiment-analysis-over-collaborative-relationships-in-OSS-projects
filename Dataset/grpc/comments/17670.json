Cross Platform\r\n- 3. Organising topics with channels really makes a difference\r\n- 4. Search history it's amazing\r\n\r\nI could go further and list all the great functionalities of slack, but we all know them ðŸ˜„ \r\n\r\n\r\nThe main point is that, slack it's much more widely used then gitter for community-based real-time chats. It's just remove the needs of 1 extra app to be installed and it can be organised way better."
