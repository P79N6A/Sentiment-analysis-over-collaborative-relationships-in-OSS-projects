    "body": "Had an issue with this on a vanilla Jessie install with attempting to use pip from the repos (apt-get install python-pip). The standard repository version of pip requires six, and the latest version of six in the standard repository is 1.8.  Pip refuses to install over a package installed by apt (so it won't install six 1.10), and uninstalling six via apt uninstalls pip.  Would suggest for the time being that these instructions be updated to suggest installing pip directly via the script on the pip site (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) instead of via apt, which resolves all these issues, and gets you the latest version of pip as a bonus.\n"
