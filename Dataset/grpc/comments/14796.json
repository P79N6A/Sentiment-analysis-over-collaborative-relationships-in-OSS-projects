    "body": "Thanks for raising the issue. Unlike many other network packages, gRPC doesn't commit to doing any work in the async API except when an application thread has yielded time to gRPC by calling Next; there are no background threads doing the work of the RPC at other times.\r\n\r\nSo, I can give one immediately available suggestion: have your own thread (or threads) that calls Next in a loop and have that thread set condition variables, event FDs, or whatever other mechanism you need to interact with your main event loop.\r\n\r\nFor a longer term solution, I can share that we have some efforts underway to integrate gRPC core with external event managers. So far, the target has been for Python but it is likely that there will be efforts to enable C++ integrations some time in the next two quarters."
