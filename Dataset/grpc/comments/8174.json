    "body": "Oddly, this is a datarace coming through protobuf. It is tagged as a benign\ndata race, but C++11 doesn't accept that such a thing exists. I believe\nthat even an idempotent data race has catch-fire semantics. I'm not sure\nwhy these first became visible with the new sync C++ qps tests, but it's a\nreal issue. Will investigate.\n\nOn Thu, Sep 22, 2016 at 2:53 PM adelez notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Assigned #8174 https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/8174 to @vjpai\n> https://github.com/vjpai.\n> \n> â€”\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/8174#event-799560393, or mute the\n> thread\n> https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AIdEkDFPhP1LYlLJKFhhQR2es_ed9rofks5qsvjIgaJpZM4KEZz1\n> .\n"

We need to either make the relevant annotation mean something to tsan in OSS, or we need to add it to [the TSAN suppression file](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/tools/tsan_suppressions.txt) . I will go with the latter route for now and send a PR for this soon.\n"
