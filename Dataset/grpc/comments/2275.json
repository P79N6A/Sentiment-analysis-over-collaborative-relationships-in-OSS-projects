    "body": "Tried to run some gRPC PHP examples with Apache / Nginx on Mac OS X and run into multiple problems:\n1. Tested with Apache\n   - Success: Ran some simple statements like `$server = new Grpc\\Server([]);`\n     - So that means at least the `grpc.so` extension is loaded properly\n   - Failed: Anything that needs functions like `startBatch()`\n     - The apache process `httpd` just hangs and needs to be killed\n   - Failed: Anything that needs constants like `OP_SEND_INITIAL_METADATA`\n     - Strangely, just printing these constants works the first few times, and then the `grpc.so` extension mysteriously got unloaded by PHP and the `httpd` process eventually crashes\n2. Tested with `nginx` and `php-fpm`\n   - Almost the same result as above.\n   - Just that the `nginx` process, in general, can be more gracefully restarted after a crash, than `httpd`. \n   \n   At this point it feels like it doesn't matter whether Apache or nginx is the webserver. I focus on php-fpm as the FastCGI server.\n3. Run `php-fpm` at port 9000\n   \n   ```\n   $ ./homebrew/opt/php55/sbin/php-fpm --fpm-config ./homebrew/etc/php/5.5/php-fpm.conf\n   ```\n4. Run `cgi-fcgi` to connect directly to `php-fpm` running at port 9000, with a simple script\n   \n   ```\n   $ SCRIPT_FILENAME=/var/www/simple.php REQUEST_METHOD=GET cgi-fcgi -bind -connect localhost:9000\n   ```\n   \n   simple.php\n   \n   ```\n   <?php\n   print(\"1\");\n   $channel = new Grpc\\Channel('localhost:50051', []);\n   print(\"2\\n\");\n   ```\n   \n   It returns correctly.\n   \n   ```\n   X-Powered-By: PHP/5.5.26\n   Content-type: text/html\n   \n   12\n   ```\n5. Run `cgi-fcgi` to connect directly to `php-fpm` running at port 9000, with the Hello World example\n   \n   ```\n   $ SCRIPT_FILENAME=grpc-common/php/greeter_client.php REQUEST_METHOD=GET cgi-fcgi -bind -connect localhost:9000\n   ```\n   \n   It hangs.\n   \n   I did verify that running the `greeter_client.php` script directly on PHP CLI returns successfully\n   \n   ```\n   $ php grpc-common/php/greeter_client.php\n   Hello world\n   ```\n"

    "body": "I need to reopen this one. Our team's been trying to get the PHP extension to work reliably and consistently for the better part of last week – without any luck. Sometimes, after a fresh start of Apache it works for 1 or 2 calls and then it doesn't with the message in the log: `Notice: Use of undefined constant OP_SEND_INITIAL_METADATA - assumed 'OP_SEND_INITIAL_METADATA'`. I've been able to put together a Dockerfile for you to try out.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Clone repository here: `https://github.com/alfatraining/docker-grpc-php-test`.\n2. Run `make`.\nThis compiles gRPC, the PHP extension, and runs the tests. This should take about 15 minutes (give or take). After that, it starts Apache2, the NodeJS example server and a `tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log`.\n3. Go to `http://{insert-your-docker-host-ip-here}:8880/greet.php` in your browser.\n\nThis will work for a few calls (sometimes just the first, sometimes 2 more) and then it doesn't. Blank page. Take a look at the log output of the tail:\n\n```\n[Tue Sep 29 14:05:41.518549 2015] [:error] [pid 22] [client 192.168.99.1:52252] PHP Notice:  Use of undefined constant OP_SEND_INITIAL_METADATA - assumed 'OP_SEND_INITIAL_METADATA' in /var/www/grpc/examples/php/vendor/grpc/grpc/src/php/lib/Grpc/UnaryCall.php on line 54\n[Tue Sep 29 14:05:41.518586 2015] [:error] [pid 22] [client 192.168.99.1:52252] PHP Notice:  Use of undefined constant OP_RECV_INITIAL_METADATA - assumed 'OP_RECV_INITIAL_METADATA' in /var/www/grpc/examples/php/vendor/grpc/grpc/src/php/lib/Grpc/UnaryCall.php on line 55\n[Tue Sep 29 14:05:41.518594 2015] [:error] [pid 22] [client 192.168.99.1:52252] PHP Notice:  Use of undefined constant OP_SEND_MESSAGE - assumed 'OP_SEND_MESSAGE' in /var/www/grpc/examples/php/vendor/grpc/grpc/src/php/lib/Grpc/UnaryCall.php on line 56\n[Tue Sep 29 14:05:41.518600 2015] [:error] [pid 22] [client 192.168.99.1:52252] PHP Notice:  Use of undefined constant OP_SEND_CLOSE_FROM_CLIENT - assumed 'OP_SEND_CLOSE_FROM_CLIENT' in /var/www/grpc/examples/php/vendor/grpc/grpc/src/php/lib/Grpc/UnaryCall.php on line 57\n[Tue Sep 29 14:05:41.518657 2015] [:error] [pid 22] [client 192.168.99.1:52252] PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught exception 'InvalidArgumentException' with message 'batch keys must be integers' in /var/www/grpc/examples/php/vendor/grpc/grpc/src/php/lib/Grpc/UnaryCall.php:57\\nStack trace:\\n#0 /var/www/grpc/examples/php/vendor/grpc/grpc/src/php/lib/Grpc/UnaryCall.php(57): Grpc\\\\Call->startBatch(Array)\\n#1 /var/www/grpc/examples/php/vendor/grpc/grpc/src/php/lib/Grpc/BaseStub.php(181): Grpc\\\\UnaryCall->start(Object(helloworld\\\\HelloRequest), Array, Array)\\n#2 /var/www/helloworld.php(155): Grpc\\\\BaseStub->_simpleRequest('/helloworld.Gre...', Object(helloworld\\\\HelloRequest), '\\\\\\\\helloworld\\\\\\\\Hel...', Array, Array)\\n#3 /var/www/html/greet.php(8): helloworld\\\\GreeterClient->SayHello(Object(helloworld\\\\HelloRequest))\\n#4 {main}\\n  thrown in /var/www/grpc/examples/php/vendor/grpc/grpc/src/php/lib/Grpc/UnaryCall.php on line 57\n```\n\nThe container builds the extension on Debian off of the `release-0_11` branch so it includes the fixes from version `0.11.0` and `0.11.1`.
