    "body": "I think there are a couple of bugs here, one in the grpc-protoc-plugin and one that appears to be in the protoc side of it.\r\n\r\n1) In the grpc-protoc-plugin, I think we should basically be passing `package_name` rather than `file->package()` on this line: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/compiler/ruby_generator.cc#L212, because otherwise, as is currently, we are just ignoring and `ruby_package` statements from the current file when generating that bit of code. Things appear to be \"working\" in the non-import case because it looks like this problem is actually \"cancelled out\" by the next.\r\n\r\n2) cc @TeBoring, when generating a service, I'm finding that, when a service includes a message that was imported from a file containing a `ruby_package` statement, the `ruby_package` from that file is appears to be ignored by the `MethodDecriptor` object. E.g., in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/compiler/ruby_generator.cc#L44, if `MethodDescriptor->input_type()->full_name()` has the canonical package name rather than the `ruby_package` name. Is this expected, or a known issue?\r\n"
