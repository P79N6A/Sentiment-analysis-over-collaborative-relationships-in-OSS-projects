    "body": "Ok, I think we can accommodate this change within the planned forking  change, but just FYI, we're thinking that the planned forking API will look like:\r\n\r\n1. make sure there are no background threads or active grpc calls\r\n2. `grpc prefork`\r\n3. do fork\r\n4. `grpc postfork (child or parent)`\r\n5. resume\r\n\r\ncalls to prefork and postfork will internally close and reopen fds, and also shutdown/join library-internal background threads and then restart them.\r\n\r\nNote as is currently, I'd suspect that forking after a channel/server has been created would break things mainly just because of the lost background threads. (servers might be less susceptible because background threads at least in the ruby extension are more involved on the client side).\r\nBut if useful we can still go forward with this PR."
