    "body": "grpc_completion_queue_shutdown is just a useful helper. You won't get a QUEUE_SHUTDOWN event without calling it, but if you know that there's nothing left on the queue then you don't need it.\n\nI tend to find that asynchronous driver code tends to want to call it, whereas synchronous driver code tends to not need it at all, as the number of outstanding completions is obvious at each point in the code.\n"
