    "body": "The style guide rules for this have changed since this bug was filed.  Global objects of non-POD type are now allowed as long as they are trivially destructible, as per:\r\n\r\nhttps://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Static_and_Global_Variables\r\n\r\nI suspect that the tracer objects are trivially destructible, although we should verify this before closing this bug."
