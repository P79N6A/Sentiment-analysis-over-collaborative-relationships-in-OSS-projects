    "body": "Current package.json file specifies as `'^6.7.0'`, am I missing something?\r\nAnyways, added the logic to skip the test if protobufjs doesn't look like 6.\r\n\r\n> I would strongly recommend against using the message types that are output there.\r\nI'm not sure I get this. Here are my understandings, correct me where I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nWith protobufjs 5.x, `loadObject()` works like:\r\n- if namespace, returns an object with the child nodes\r\n- if service, returns a wrapped class of the service\r\n- if message, returns the message class (by calling `build()`)\r\n\r\nMy change is doing the same thing in protobufjs 6.x.\r\nThe current protobuf_js_6_common.js misunderstands message as namespace because message types also have `nested` property, so it returns an empty object. I think it should return the message class. And it looks like unnecessary to call `build()`, the `value` is already the message class."
