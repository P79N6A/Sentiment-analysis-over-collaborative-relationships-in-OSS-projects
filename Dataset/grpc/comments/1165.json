    "body": "I believe we should. Bringing it to a package means we'd have more options for our end users, and it would make the installation process smoother.\n\nIn terms of work involved, the biggest challenge and blocker however is OpenSSL. It's against the Debian/Ubuntu rules to have an official package that has an embedded OpenSSL - which is what we're currently doing for building gRPC without a system OpenSSL 1.0.2. So following the dependency tree for a python-grpc package, we need to first get a gRPC package, which itself depends on having OpenSSL 1.0.2 available for Ubuntu.\n\nI tried doing this, and while I got mixed results, I feel nervous about us officially providing OpenSSL. This is a responsibility which isn't really desirable in my opinion. So we'd need to wait for OpenSSL 1.0.2 to be an official Ubuntu package.\n\nNote that right now, it's an official Debian experimental package - so we could get started in that direction.\n"
