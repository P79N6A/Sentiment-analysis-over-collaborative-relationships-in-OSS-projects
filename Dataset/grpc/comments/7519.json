But I'd rather not update to 1.6 if we didn't have to. \n\nThanks for looking into this! Just figuring this out...\n"

    "body": "To get ready to potentially use the fix to the project.json files in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/7580, I \"pre-merged\" those changes into this one.\n\nUnfortunately, targetting dotnetcoreapp in the project.jsons still lead me to the same issue in restoring nugets: 'x provides a compile-time assembly compatible with <framework> but not run-time assembly could be found for <runtime, e.g. osx>'. But from https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/2915, I believe it is a bug in the new nuget client.\n\nRestoring packages with dotnet cli seems to work though, so the most recent commit switches the pre_build scripts to use dotnet cli instead of nuget commands.\n\nMy plan is now to just install dotnet cli on test workers. \n\ncc @jtattermusch \n"
