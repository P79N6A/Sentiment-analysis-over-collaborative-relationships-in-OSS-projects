It seems to be expected behavior?"

    "body": "I don't think we should add support for `make uninstall` - with the way make works it's inherently fragile and it's an added maintenance cost and it's hard to make sure the uninstallation works reliably (and a broken uninstall is worse than no uninstall at all IMHO).\r\n\r\nIf you need to be able uninstall (which is understandable), I'd suggest installing grpc under a prefix (via make or cmake) and then deleting entire prefix directory to uninstall. Alternatively, you can use bazel that will give you a hermetic build environment (so no uninstall is ever needed), or you can try to use one of the community-provided packages (like vcpkg). "
