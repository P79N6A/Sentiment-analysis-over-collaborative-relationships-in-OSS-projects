    "body": "QPS on all benchmarks with the current timer and this timer look nearly the same, when ran on an 8-core, 30gb, ubuntu host.\nFor streaming constrained, unary constrained, unary unconstrained, streaming unconstrained, with the current timer and this timer, I see QPS of ~2.3k, ~1.7k, ~2.5k, and ~4.1k, respectively, so the wall times given from each timer seem to be about the same.\n\nFor rough results of the cpu usages I got from this:\n\nOn the same host, server and client cpu usages for the constrained tests seem to differ but range from around 40 to 60% for user and 20 to 30% for system. I think these might be a little higher than expected though since they're sharing the same process with a worker server.\n\nFor the unconstrained tests, the client and server are higher, they but range from around 60 to 80% for system and 90 to 120% for user time, which I take is from the summing of cpu times on parallel threads.\n"
