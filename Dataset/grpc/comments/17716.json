    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThe Makefile of the current version of GRPC says this about cross-compiling:\r\n\r\n>The steps for cross-compiling are as follows: \r\n>\r\n>First, clone and make install of grpc using the native compilers for the host. Also, install protoc (e.g., from a package like apt-get). Then clone a fresh grpc for the actual cross-compiled build. Set the environment variable GRPC_CROSS_COMPILE to true. Set CC, CXX, LD, LDXX, AR, and STRIP to the cross-compiling binaries. Also set PROTOBUF_CONFIG_OPTS to indicate cross-compilation to protobuf (e.g., PROTOBUF_CONFIG_OPTS=\"--host=arm-linux --with-protoc=/usr/local/bin/protoc\" ). Set HAS_PKG_CONFIG=false. To build tests, go to third_party/gflags and follow its ccmake instructions. Make sure that you enable building shared libraries and set your prefix to  something useful like /usr/local/cross. You will also need to set GRPC_CROSS_LDOPTS and GRPC_CROSS_AROPTS to hold additional required arguments for LD and AR (examples below)\r\n>\r\n>Then you can do a make from the cross-compiling fresh clone!\r\n\r\nWhen I wrote the issue and post the steps, I made a mistake with one flag. Change the step of `export GRPC_CROSS_COMPILATION=true` with `export GRPC_CROSS_COMPILE=true` and try again with a fresh grpc.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJ. A."
