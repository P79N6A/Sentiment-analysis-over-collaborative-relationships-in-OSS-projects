    "body": "Hi Mark, \r\n\r\nThe problem is found. That is, since the mutex in our code is statically allocated, there is no need to execute gpr_mu_destory() (only necessary for the dynamically allocated mutex) on it. Quoting from Michael Kerrisk's \"The Linux Programming Interface\"  - \"When an automatically or dynamically allocated mutex is no longer required, it should be destroyed using pthread_mutex_destroy(). (It is not necessary to call pthread_mutex_destroy() on a mutex that was statically initialized using PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER.)\". Regarding PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER, it is the macro that can be used to initialize mutex that are statically allocated. The effect is equivalent to dynamic initialization by a call to pthread_mutex_init() with parameter attr specified as NULL, except that no error checks are performed. \r\n\r\nI am currently in the process of re-running grpc Jenkins tests and will let you know if all tests are passed. \r\n"

    "body": "Hi Mark, \r\n\r\nThe code has been revised. The problem was in my build.yaml where I did not specify \"plugin\" field for my gts_plugin. After adding the field and regenerating the project, which automatically updated grpc_plugin_registry and grpc_cronet_plugin_registry, all previous failures in MAC tests have been resolved. I have still got one windows failure (timeout), for which I have little clue regarding its relevance to my PR. Would you please take a look and see if it's relevant? "
