    "body": "Hello there,\nSorry for the delayed response. Indeed, it does seem to be the case that docker is not currently handling that sysconf call as we expect, according to docker/docker#20770 , and there does not seem to be a resolution at hand.\n\nNote that you can customize the thread pool if you want. ThreadPoolInterface is an abstract class that is defined in [src/cpp/server/thread_pool_interface.h](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/cpp/server/thread_pool_interface.h) and only has to support 1 method. We currently don't support overriding the thread-pool in server builder but could consider adding that feature. (I think we used to have it at one point but it was never used so we removed it.) I will investigate.\n"
