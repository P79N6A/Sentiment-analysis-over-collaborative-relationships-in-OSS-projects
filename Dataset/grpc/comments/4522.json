It is great to see such engagement.\n\nPlease note that I am currently actively working on x64 support as well and some of the changes you've suggested are also part of my existing pull requests (see #4512).\nI am also trying to make x64 builds on VS2013 and VS2015 run continuously on Jenkins, so that we can be sure it works in the future.\nRecently, we've also changed the definition of gpr_timespec type, which should result in much simpler P/Invoking (#4397).\n\nI'll try to go through the PR and put some comments. Unfortunately, after today, I'll be OOO until Jan 12, so please don't expect much progress on this PR until then.\n\nBtw, the pull request needs conflict resolution.\n"
