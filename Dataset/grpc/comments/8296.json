    "body": "Maybe this makes sense in a wider context (upcoming load balancing features, or for clients of stateful servers). But it does not make sense in our narrow context ☺️ At the moment, every time we make a request we have to check the return code and retry (once) if the error is \"service unavailable\". I think the fact that it is possible to get a \"service unavailable\" error when the service is, in fact, available (but was not available at some point in the past that you don't care about) shows that something is a bit off.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there could be a way to label a channel as being OK to reconnect over (so long as the disconnection happened while there were no outstanding requests, and so long as the first reconnection attempt succeeds) for naive clients like ours? \r\n"

Without doing periodic health checks, there is no way for the client to know that its connection with the original server is no longer good. It needs that first failure to go through the process of remaking the connection.\r\n\r\nGood news is that this will be fix once retry support is integrated in to the c core.
