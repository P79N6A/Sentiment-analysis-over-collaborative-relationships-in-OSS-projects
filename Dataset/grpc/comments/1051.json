There is a more official way to do it than what you said - define a class called nullptr_t that supports a templated conversion to any other class or member class. This is better than just using NULL in case we are using it in the context of any functions overloaded on a pointer argument. We can probably introduce this as a grpc::nullptr. Low priority but can be done without too much work.\n"

I have tried 3 different solutions to this (and thought of a fourth), but they all fall apart because we like to use ternary operators and also use a lot of unique_ptr.\n1. #define nullptr NULL\n   This doesn't work because NULL is 0L (a const long int), and there is no implicit conversion of this to unique_ptr . Also all our uses of this in ternary operators with unique_ptr or other pointer types on the other side of the \":\" fall apart\n2. #define nullptr ((void *)0)\n   Unlike C, C++ doesn't allow implicit conversion of void \\* to any arbitrary T *, so there is again an issue with our use of ternary operators and unique_ptr\n3. const class {\n   public:\n   template <class T> operator T*() const {return static_cast<T *>0;}\n   operator bool() {return false;}\n   private:\n   void operator &() const = delete;\n   } nullptr = {};\n   This is suggested as an alternative in the original document proposing nullptr.\n\nunique_ptr is again the problem here. There is no implicit conversion from our anonymous class to unique_ptr, the way that there is from nullptr_t to unique_ptr\n1. Make a real class object and have nullptr be a pointer to that.\n   This will fall apart because conversions to unique_ptr will consider this set, whereas conversions from nullptr to unique_ptr are supposed to be considered unset.\n"

There are many lambdas in the tests (particularly qps), so that might be too difficult to fix, but other tests will work fine and the library will be in working shape soon. I intend a pull request about this some time in the next few days.\n"
