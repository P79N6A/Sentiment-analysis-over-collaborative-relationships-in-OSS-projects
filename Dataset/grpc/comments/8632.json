    "body": "@rafaelsales looking at this PR again after a long time. FTR I think that the problem you're describing would be most easily fixed by setting the `pool_size` parameter to increase size of the server's thread pool, as is done in [this test server](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/qps/server.rb#L53). I'd have a hard time imaging a scenario that relies specifically on the \"queue\" behavior for waiting-to-be-serviced calls and that can't be fixed by increasing the server's concurrent RPC capacity, but it would be interesting to know if there was one."
