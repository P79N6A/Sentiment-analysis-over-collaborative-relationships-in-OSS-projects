    "body": "It's important to note that grpc_completion_queue (and therefore CompletionQueue) isn't strictly FIFO here, and so to implement this we'd have to:\r\n1. change the grpc_call logic to insert this guarantee (likely minimally adding another atomic in the path)\r\n2. change the grpc_completion_queue semantics to preserve order, or minimally partial order\r\n\r\nThe latter will have some reasonably severe performance impacts that I'm not certain we could live with."

    "body": "Good point, and I think that's another strong argument against: nothing at all currently guarantees a FIFO completion queue, nor should there be (since concurrent completion events are, by nature, independent). This was a user feature request, and I think it's best to close it after documenting these as issues."
