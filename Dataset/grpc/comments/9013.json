    "body": "I agree that it is painful to build gRPC C++ on windows, but at the same time it is not true that we are building it for every test run on our testing infrastructure.  We do build C core on windows, which is pretty trivial compared to C++ and can be done in visual studio (and by other means) - so we don't have any secret sauce (btw, all the scripts that run our tests are public in our repository so that's not even possible)\r\n\r\nCurrently, building C++ on windows is a bit experimental (it works, but we haven't put together all the pieces to make it pleasant and simple to build).\r\nI think the right plan here is to:\r\n1. make C++ easily buildable on windows (the problem is mostly the openssl and protobuf integration).\r\n2. document it properly\r\n3. (publishing artifacts is optional - because everyone can build them as easily. Also it is not clear that the artifacts would be usable by everyone based on the compiler and linker options)."

Only real notes/problems I ran into were having to downgrade OpenSSL to the latest 1.0.n version because of API/artifact changes in 1.1.n and having to disable building the `grpc++_reflection` build because it doesn't seem to generate the .pb.h/.pb.cc files on its own and even when I generate them myself with `protoc` they are missing the `ServerReflection` type.  Granted, took me quite a while to find all of this via the thrilling practice of reading the CMake files, but it wasn't 40 hours of work either.\r\n\r\nOh, I also had to modify the cmake_install paths for zlib by hand, no matter how many different ways I provided `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` it just didn't work, mostly because it was hard-coded to the Program Files folder."
