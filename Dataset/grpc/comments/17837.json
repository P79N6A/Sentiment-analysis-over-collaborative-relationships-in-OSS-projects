    "body": "I was thinking through this and I'm still not 100% sure what's the right approach.\r\nMy concerns:\r\n- I think having both `BindService` and `BindServiceWithoutImplementation` is too much, that's why I recommended replacing the `BindService` overload instead.\r\n- At the same time, there's value in being able to bind directly to  service implementation class. (because it avoids needing to use reflection to get to the methods once service instance is available).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about an alternative approach:\r\n- keep the `BindService(grpc::ServiceBinderBase serviceBinder, MathBase serviceImpl)` overload but allow serviceImpl to be null.\r\n- the body of BindService needs to be updated so it accepts serviceImpl == null:\r\n```\r\n// we can't use ?? because the generated code needs to be buildable with older C# lang version\r\nserviceBinder.AddMethod(__Method_Div, serviceImpl != null ? serviceImpl.Div : null);\r\n```\r\n- update the doc comments accordingly\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n- one can still bind to service implementation if an instance is available\r\n- this prevents users from regenerating the code after the next grpc release, because the BindService method signature stays the same\r\n- (mostly theoretical) in general case, the method name from `.proto` file definition and the C# generated serverside method aren't necessarily the same (there can be some C# source specific escaping in conversion from the Method.Name  to the actual C# serverside method name). The codegen can easily reflect that, but this could be more tricky if accessing the method implementation via reflection. "

    "body": "@jtattermusch I considered this design as well (in fact I alluded to it [here](https://github.com/aspnet/grpc-dotnet/pull/9#discussion_r250452736)). Though I ran into a few issues and felt the current approach is simpler and cleaner.\r\n\r\nThough you don't have to change the method signature of `BindService`, you do need to change the `AddMethod` signature. Since the expression `serviceImpl != null ? serviceImpl.Div : null` gives an error `Type of conditional expression cannot be determined because there is no implicit conversion between '<null>' and 'method group'`. There are ways around this but we'll probably need to modify how `ServiceBinderBase`'s `AddMethod` signature looks like as they will probably lose the ability to differentiate between different ServerMethods (`UnaryServerMethod` vs `ClientStreamingServerMethod`) due to potentially being passed null. Though we can probably address these concerns, it felt like a more significant effort than it's worth, but I may be wrong. I could investigate this approach further if you prefer.\r\n\r\nI also wasn't sure how back compat and support for binding to instance were prioritized. Originally I didn't want to remove the overload that binds to an instance since I didn't want to break back compat. However, you mentioned that these methods were originally meant to be used by ASP.NET so it's fine to remove if we don't plan on using them. If we were more concerned with these two points, I would prefer having the two overloads `BindService(grpc::ServiceBinderBase serviceBinder, MathBase serviceImpl)` and `BindService(grpc::ServiceBinderBase serviceBinder)`."
