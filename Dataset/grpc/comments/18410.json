    "body": "Hi @vjpai Ive wanted to double check with you which was the right place on doing this tests.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, the right place will be here [1], by just adding a new test case that will make an ad-hoc test that the `grpc_channel_watch_connectivity_state` does not suffer from any deadlock.\r\n\r\nSeems that most of the code and the fixtures are ready to be used with the tradition next completion queue. Despite the effort of making the fixture and the code compatible with the two completion queue types will be the desired target, I'm inclined to believe that this would go out of the scope of the PR, and surely will make the PR quite unmanageable.\r\n\r\nSo my idea is just ad an ad-hoc test, for example, `test_watch_connectivity_cq_callback` which would use and create all of the requirements - cq_callback, functor for attending the callback - but reusing the current fixture.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/test/core/end2end/tests/connectivity.cc#L168"
