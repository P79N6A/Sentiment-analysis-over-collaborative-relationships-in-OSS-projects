    "body": "~~tl;dr my best guess is xamarin targets .netstandard 1.4, whereas grpc targets .netstandard 1.5, therefor it does not work (ref [using-xamarin-forms-with-net-standard](https://oren.codes/2016/07/09/using-xamarin-forms-with-net-standard/), and [grpc pre 1.0.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Grpc.Core/1.0.1-pre1) )~~ see update below\n\nI finally got time to try again. I needed to start with a fresh environment, as I ran into several unrelated issues.\n\nI created a PCL targeting .NetStandard 1.5. The project.json looks like this\n`{\n  \"supports\": {},\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"Google.Protobuf\": \"3.1.0\",\n    \"Grpc\": \"1.0.1-pre1\",\n    \"Grpc.Core\": \"1.0.1-pre1\",\n    \"NETStandard.Library\": \"1.6.0\"\n  },\n  \"frameworks\": {\n    \"netstandard1.5\": { \"imports\": [ \"portable-net45+wpa81+wp8+win8\" ] }\n  }\n}`\nI also referenced proto models and a service (basically the greeter service from the tutorial).\nThat stuff compiles.\n\nHowever when referenced in an Xamarin Android project, it first complained about a missing package. Can't remember what that was, and unfortunatly cant reproduce. My best guess is that Xamarin is not compatible with .NetStandard 1.5 ([using-xamarin-forms-with-net-standard](https://oren.codes/2016/07/09/using-xamarin-forms-with-net-standard/)). Seems it only works with netstandard1.4.\n\nI played around with that setup (referenced the dll instead the project and some other stuff can't remember) and now Im in the state as 6 days before, where I actually can compile the android project, deploy that to the emulator, and it immediatly crashes. But that also happens for clean projects.  I think because of the beforementioned stuff its pointless to add the error descriptions here.\n\n// Update: actually the first link provided states that when targeting iOs and Android .NetStandard 1.6 should be compatible\n"

The App1 project targets Android Xamarin and uses a packages.config file. When referencing the Grpc PCL, beforementioned error occurs.\nThis is likely due to [this issue](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/10445). \n\nI think there are two workarounds avaible. \n1) Converting the main application project to use project.json file to utilize nuget 3. That didn't work. VS complained about a douzen missing files (Android namespace). I'm not sure if I got the conversion right though.\n2) Copying the \\packages\\System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.4.0.0\\ref\\netstandard1.1\\System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.dll to the nuget cache and there to \\System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation.4.0.0\\lib\\netstandard1.1\\ But didn't work (still missing mentioned dll).\n\nI would appreciate any help or guidance on what to try\n"

I'd have to experiment a little bit to be able to be able to give some guidance. \n\nBtw, grpc and protobuf are not the same (protobuf uses the good old PCL profile259 and gRPC targets netstandard1.5 directly). Perhaps you could try to get Protobuf working first - that should really work out of the box, because there is no native dependencies, it's pure C# code. After you have a working example with protobuf, you can try adding gRPC and see what happens.\n"

    "body": "@lostobject Was in the middle of posting when you replied. It is definitely doable, assuming that calling one function indicates everything will work. The core .NET library uses some delegates to allow dynamic loading of the library in NativeMethods. It should be pretty straightforward to change that to the DllImport annotation, preserving the signatures. I could whip up a quick script to do that change to see if it can be done so that we can verify an actual functioning native library. If someone else has anymore experience with how android stores and loads the native libraries, it might be possible to use dlopen. I'll do some research.\r\nGetting all of this into a repeatable build is a different question :-D I'll try cleaning up my grpc repo and make a fork so others can join in."

(Mac might be useful for experimenting, as compiling grpc_csharp_ext.so for Mac OS X already works no problem).\r\n\r\nBtw, the branch 1.1.x has been released recently.\r\n\r\nAdd [DllImport] vs getting a delegate from a function pointer: until summer 2016, we've actually been using DllImports when on windows, but then we got rid of that code to avoid being repetitive. If things work with [DllImport] (they should), figuring out how to get function pointers working or add DllImports back is mostly a technicality."
