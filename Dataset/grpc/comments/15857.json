Adding new `.cc` files or changing the layout of your `.bzl` may mean additional effort every time an update is done.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, given the simplicity of this change, are there strong reasons why `copts` should _not_ be exposed?

The file `build.yaml` should disappear once we can migrate all of\nthe test system towards using Bazel instead of the Makefile.\n\nThen we would generate all of the library build files from the BUILD file\ninstead of that build.yaml. If the BUILD file is permitting things that are\noverly-specific, such as, well, copts, this would render this task\ndifficult. Hence the idea of the grpc_cc_library layer that allows for\nabstracting ideas such as \"public_headers\" or a \"deps\" and \"external_deps\"\nlist that isn't tied to specific Bazel targets. (on the latter, I know\nthere are some that slipped, and we must eventually fix this).\n\nIn this case, both \"copts\" and \"-w\" are fairly tied to Bazel / gcc.\nSomething that would be more platform-agnostic would be to say for instance\n\"disable_warnings\" or something like this.\n\nOn Tue, Jul 10, 2018 at 10:57 AM, Robin Nabel <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> Nothing, you're right, I should have listed that option, too.
