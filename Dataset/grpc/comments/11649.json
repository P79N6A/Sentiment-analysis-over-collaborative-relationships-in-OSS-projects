    "body": "Hmm, right, there's indeed a recursion point here in the destructor. No other location has something like that by the way. It's probably possible (if not desirable) to remove the recursion here. However this would only migrate the problem towards memory allocation instead of a call stack overflow.\r\n\r\nAdding a limit on the size of the json tree is easily doable by starting to count the number of nodes into its root tree state: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/core/lib/json/json_string.c#L40 - once json_create_and_link has reached a certain threshold, then no other link operation should take place, and json_reader_read_char should return GRPC_JSON_READ_CHAR_ERROR to fail the inner parser."
