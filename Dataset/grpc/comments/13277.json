While the API introduced here is not perfect, it is clearly better than the one we have right now, and we should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.  I am certainly happy to discuss further to see if we can come up with some further improvements, but I think it's totally legitimate to say that the API can't be quite as simple as we might want due to performance requirements."
