    "body": "gRPC-the-protocol-independent-of-the-Protobuf-IDL has no notion of services nor methods, only host, path, metadata and messages. The proposal here is for a server to emit `INTERNAL` (\"This error code is reserved for serious errors.\") whenever it receives a `Message-Encoding` header with a value outside of a fixed set. So if we're going by what we wrote when we documented the error codes, `INTERNAL` doesn't still seem a good choice to me.\n\nBut I think picking error codes that way is the wrong approach anyway. We should pick them based on what we expect people to do about the error situation at hand. In the case of trying to use an unsupported compression mechanism:\n1. Nobody at the server side should be alerted / paged from a burst of these requests.\n2. It should declare that the client is at fault.\n3. It should make clear that nothing the user or client does will make an identical retry succeed.\n4. We expect the client app developer or the client library developer to prevent it from ever happening.\n\n`INTERNAL` is a bad fit for all of them. Both `INVALID_ARGUMENT` or `UNIMPLEMENTED` serve better those purposes. Abhishek rather reserve `INVALID_ARGUMENT` for app-level errors, which is why we went with `UNIMPLEMENTED` (\"this compression mechanism isn't implemented in the server\" isn't an outrageous interpretation anyway).\n"
