    "body": "More details:\nstruct timespec issues are because <time.h> doesn't define timespec unless _POSIX_C_SOURCE is at least 199309L. We'll have problems here unless we either change gpr_timespec to not be a typedef or we globally bump _POSIX_C_SOURCE to at least 199309L -- any include of a system header could break this.\n\nSeparately, cpu_linux.c has a similar issue with _GNU_SOURCE. This doesn't require a global bump because it is a .c file, but if we need _GNU_SOURCE defined in that file it needs to be before any other includes.\n"
