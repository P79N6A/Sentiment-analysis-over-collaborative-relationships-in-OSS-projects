    "body": "`grpc/python:1.4` in the Docker image is considered a very old gRPC release.  I just uploaded https://github.com/grpc/grpc-docker-library/blob/master/1.13.0/python/Dockerfile under the image name `grpc/python:1.13`. Please test with that and let us know if the problem remains. I'll close the issue for now. Please feel free to comment and ask to reopen if it persists."
