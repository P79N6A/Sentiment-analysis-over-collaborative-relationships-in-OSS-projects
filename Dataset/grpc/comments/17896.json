    "body": "@nicolasnoble @jtattermusch : This PR revealed an interesting infra issue. Fortunately, the Bazel RBE machines and Kokoro machines are on different kernel versions, so the difference allowed catching a leak that only showed up for certain #ifdef combinations before it went out into the wild. Is there a way to make sure that this continues in the future, or perhaps that a variety of kernels are used for testing?"
