    "body": "After discussion, it was decided that this is not a good feature, and that the user should be required to catch the tag when calling next. A user who wants to ignore the tag should declare a \"void *dummy\" and pass in \"&dummy\" as the tag reference here. Fixing it at the library level leads to another code path to maintain indefinitely in the future. This resolution also closes issue #1126 .\n"
