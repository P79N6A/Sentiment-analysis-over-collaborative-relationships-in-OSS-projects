Yes, things on the same combiner are run one-at-a-time, but is there a guarantee that that is the same as the order in which SCHED was called?"

I don't think we document this as a guarantee, but I think @ctiller has mentioned to me that we do have some code that relies on the fact that if it schedules multiple closures in the same thread, that particular set of closures will be executed in the order scheduled.  And I suspect that this is true for both the combiner scheduler and for the default exec_ctx scheduler.\r\n\r\nI don't think we make any guarantees about execution order of closures scheduled from different threads (for any scheduler).  I think this issue is only about the order of closures scheduled in a single thread.\r\n\r\nThe best way to figure this out would be to try implementing the random-reordering idea and see what breaks.  Even if we find some breakage, we can look at the problem and see if there's a reasonable way to fix the code to not make that assumption anymore."
