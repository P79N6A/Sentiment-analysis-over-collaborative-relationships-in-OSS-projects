    "body": "@DavidPhillipOster: This pull request adds the tests for the feature you just reviewed. It's small enough that one can just look at the [aggregated diffs of its commits](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/2755/files).\n\nWe already had an `InteropTests : XCTestCase` class that run tests against a local non-SSL server. This makes that class query a class method for the server address. It then adds a `InteropTestsLocalSSL : InteropTests` that returns a different address (to a locally-running SSL server), and configures that address with the test SSL parameters the server requires.\n"
