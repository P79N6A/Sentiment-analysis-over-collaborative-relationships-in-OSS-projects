    "body": "We are committed to gcc 4.4+ but our C++ code will not possibly build under any older version. We use a pretty limited subset of C++11, but anything before 4.4 doesn't even support basics like auto variables. As you've seen, we also expect the presence of certain warning levels that weren't in older versions even for building the C library. If you really need such an old version of gcc, you can still build the C library by manually removing undesirable warnings from the Makefile template, but there is essentially no C/C++ API support at that point. Strongly recommend upgrading your gcc.\n\nMeanwhile, I will close this issue since there's nothing further that we can add at this point.\n"

    "body": "So this is most likely RHEL 4, in fact. Its extended, commercial support ends the 31 March 2017, which is in a few months. Yes, I don't see ourselves going that much out of our way to support it. If you're indeed paying for the extended support of RHEL 4, I would suggest talking with your vendor about this issue instead. Otherwise, you're out of support completely, and we'd strongly suggest moving to a more recent version of your operating system.\n"
