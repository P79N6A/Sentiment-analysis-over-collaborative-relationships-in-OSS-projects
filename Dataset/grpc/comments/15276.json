    "body": "What is your `go` version? I had a similar problem (even for upstream/master and v1.12.x branch) and the tools/buildget/generate_build_additions.sh was getting stuck forever.\r\n\r\nIn my case, `go run third_party/boringssl/crypto/err/err_data_generate.go` was the root cause (go runtime was sometimes getting stuck and sometimes segfaulting which seems to be a bug in go runtime) - you can try it for yourself.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to updated your go runtime (mine was at go1.5 AFAIR) and the problem goes away - I'm reasonably sure you're seeing the same issue."
