There was a scenario some time ago (I think it was over gchat and thus lost to the aether) wherein someone was having trouble figuring out why they couldn't get their default credentials to work, and Python couldn't report back the failed precondition via code (I think it was an environment variable that wasn't set or some such?). Rather, the failure was printed to stderr, but a wrapped language user would expect to receive a detailed exception.\n"
