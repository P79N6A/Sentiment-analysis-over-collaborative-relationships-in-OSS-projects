    "body": "Agreed. Mine is cloned from github, and compiled version of protobuf is 3.0.0, which is failing, because of its mis-match to 3.0.0-alpha-3 version, which I think is bull. It's 3.0.0-GA version I think. But changing the protobuf.pc file's Version key value (tried 3.0.0-alpha-3, 3.0.0-beta-4, 3.0.0-GA) doesn't get me anywhere..\n\nUpdate: If you come across the same problem, you might not set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH to where the protobuf.pc lives.. usually check /lib/pkgconfig/ or /usr/lib/pkgconfig/ after setting the env-path, and modify Makefile from check version 3.0.0-alpha-3 to 3.0.0 and run make verify-install in grpc directory and you will get the ok.. \n\nIt appears to me that pkg-config does not recognize higher version, while the command is --atleast-version is specified.\nPersonally I think if make runs correctly, this step is trivial... What an obsessive compulsive person!\n"
