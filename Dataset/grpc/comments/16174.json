    "body": "You are using 32-bit Python 3.7 on Windows. We don't yet have binary wheels produced for that platform (we are working on it and will happen as soon as our continuous integration infra provides that distribution on the installed images; tracking bug: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/15968) and you'll need build-from-source toolchain installed for the source build to work. In the meantime, my suggested workaround is to switch to a 64-bit Python3.7 on Windows or downgrade to Python3.6 where we do have binary wheels.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this bug as we can consolidate discussions around this issue in the bug I referenced above."
