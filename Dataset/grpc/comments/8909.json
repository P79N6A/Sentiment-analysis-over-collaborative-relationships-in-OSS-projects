    "body": "I knew dockerhub could build Docker images for you, but I thought (incorrectly) that your repo structure needs to be setup according to that. We can experiment with autobuilding later, but for now there's a few issues:\r\n-- we need the _SHA suffix for the docker images because we need to make sure we are building against the right version of the dockerfile (pull requests can have modified versions of it)\r\n-- we need to make sure that the image is available before a change is merged into master (because running tests depends on it). So for now, whoever changes the dockerfile (doesn't happen often), is responsible for uploading an updated version of the image to dockerhub.\r\nAgain, we can improve the process later on.\r\n"
