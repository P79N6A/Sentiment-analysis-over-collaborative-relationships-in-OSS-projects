    "body": "That version of `grpc` is quite old, and does not support Node 10. You will have to use either a newer version of `grpc` or an older version of Node. Alternatively, you may want to try using `@grpc/grpc-js` if you only need a client. It is an alternative implementation of gRPC with the same API."
