    "body": "@jonparrott and @dhermes: [I see that `google-auth-library-python` hit 0.5](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-auth-library-python/commit/90c1c1b5c8f4eda71240b96d671976d289ca6e04); congratulations! Would the two of you now say that `google-auth-library-python` has reached the point at which gRPC Python's documentation, samples, and tests should switch from `oauth2client` to `google-auth-library-python`? Does `google-auth-library-python` have the right functionality in place and in a way that you'd be comfortable supporting? Or should we still be waiting?"
