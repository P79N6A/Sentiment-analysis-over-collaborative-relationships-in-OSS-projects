    "body": "I already had ruby installed (prerequisite was fine).\n\n\"gem install --pre grpc\" failed at first since I didn't use \"sudo\". We might want to add an instruction about that perhaps. Otherwise with \"sudo\" it was fine.\n\n\"bundle exec\" did not work because my machine didn't recognize the \"bundle\" command. I believe that \"Bundle\" is a Ruby thing - so perhaps Ruby developers should have that in their path already? I didn't and I have Ruby installed. I might not have bundle. So we might want to add some text saying that you need to ensure \"bundle\" is in your Path perhaps?\n\nDoing \"./greeter_server.rb &\" asked me to Allow incoming connections, which I did, and unsure if that was expected.\n\nDoing \"./greeter_client.rb\" printed \"Greeting: Hello World\".\n"
