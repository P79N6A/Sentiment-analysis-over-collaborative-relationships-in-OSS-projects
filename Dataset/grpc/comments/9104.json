    "body": "So you're trying to build without having previously compiled either OpenSSL or BoringSSL and put the libraries and headers in a path where the compiler/linker can find them. That's basically what these errors are saying. You can solve this (and then be stuck with the next build problem, then the next, then the next...) by making sure your build environment can locate the OpenSSL libraries (static .libs appears to be the preferred way) and headers.\r\n\r\nBut...\r\n\r\ngrpc is so difficult to build on Windows that someone has created a repo specifically to ease the building process: https://github.com/plasticbox/grpc-windows\r\n\r\nIt worked for me; I highly recommend you check out the grpc-windows repo. I am not optimistic that efforts in upstream grpc will yield anywhere _near_ as easy of a build on Windows in the near future."
