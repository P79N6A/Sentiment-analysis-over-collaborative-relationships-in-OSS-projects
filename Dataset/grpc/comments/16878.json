    "body": "I had this same issue today too. The issue lies with the version of gcc, which doesn't support C++11, which introduced the [fixed width integer types](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/integer).\r\n\r\nDebian 7.0 doesn't actually support gcc 4.8 (which introduced support for C++11) out of the box. The recommended approach is to upgrade Debian to a newer version so you can get a more recent version of gcc but I suspect, as was the case with me, if you have such an old version of Debian, it's because you're running a legacy server that can't be updated.\r\n\r\nYou can install the jessie version of gcc 4.8 with some trickery but you wouldn't be able to use that machine to compile for Debian wheezy any longer. It also upgrades/removes some software, so do this at your own risk! The steps are outlined in a stack exchange answer: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/171089"
