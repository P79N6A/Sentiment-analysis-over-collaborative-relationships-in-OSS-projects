    "body": "A bit unrelated: the run_interop_tests.py --manual_run will allow you to build ready-to-test docker images for  java and go  (because the run_interop_tests.py script lives outside of those repos, so you can apply the current version to older versions of java and go).  For grpc/grpc repo, we will need to find a way to generate the images for older releases that don't have the --manual_run support yet.   \r\n\r\nPerhaps checking out older release and applying https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/10037 on top of it would work, but there also might be some conflicts. alternatively, we could just make sure to patch the part that deletes the docker images and use the commandline from the most recent version - at least some of the well established interop tests cases should handle that just fine, their cmdline interface is pretty stable. Btw, this is another reason why storing the cmdlog in the docker image itself doesn't seem to be useful - because there's going to be a manual step to figure out the comments for older releases."
