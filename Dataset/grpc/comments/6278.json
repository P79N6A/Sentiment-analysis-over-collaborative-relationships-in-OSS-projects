In C++ code base, with the streaming calls, last time I looked, there was no way to set a timeout on an individual read call, only on the whole lifetime of the stream. There is no specific timeout on something like `ClientReader::Read()`, which is what the generated code is using. It is only the `ClientReader()` constructor that sets the deadline. I was going to file an issue asking for a change. I am mentioning that now because to deal with this specific Bigtable problem I am setting deadline but I can not tune that deadline value very well because I have to be conscious of the total possible lifetime of the `ClientReader`. Should I file a different issue? There really should be a way to set an individual timeout on every next `ClientReader::Read()` call.\n"

    "body": "@ay60  and the cloud bigtable team had a discussion today.  A couple of interesting tidbits came up\n1. Once the problem comes up, the \"session\" (in ay60's terms... I'm assuming that means a Channel) does not work for additional requests.  He has to create a new session in order to perform new RPCs.\n2. @ay60 is creating a ReadRowRequest with a range starting at a particular key with an open ended stop key.  He reads some of the streamed responses, and then cancels the call.  We've had some problems in the past with similar requests where the response has not been fully consumed on the client side.  We've run tests with without canceling the call, and we've seen that many of these types of long running, partially consumed response RPCs tickles a server-side flow control issue which OOMs our servers. ay60's case could cause the same issue, and we'll have to test for it.\n3. @ay60 has an effective retry mechanism.  Once the old channel gets a timeout after a few seconds and gets into a bad state, his code reconnects and retries the query.  This process works for him, but is not ideal.\n\nWe'll definitely do more testing about the \"start a scan, read a few rows, cancel, repeat\" scenario.  It could be another case that isn't handled effectively on our end.\n\nIn the short term, perhaps the best way forward is to work on an approach that doesn't invoke the potential OOM.  That may involve a bit of Bigtable schema or query design which will allow better targeting of range scans.  We'd be glad to brainstorm on that front.\n"

    "body": "Just to clarify. I am not sure if any of the scans that the app is doing can be qualified as \"large scan\". The test suite inserts the total of about 700 records in the database. The scan keys are not open-ended on the lower boundary. Still, even if they are, there are no more that 700 rows to read for every read.  And looking at the gRPC trace, grepping for len=[0-9]\\* field in the MutateRow call, just to make sure we are not sending crazy sized records to Bigtable, I am getting an average value of 126. This is not a huge data set by any means. \n"

I was looking for any reports of a similar problem and I found this, so it may or may not be related. I have described the problem I am facing in this post:\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/grpc-io/1t5UC8lPnxs\r\n\r\nI was trying to understand what might be causing the issue - and I wondered whether it is something to do with using pointers as tags. I don't understand what these tags are used for but is it possible that every so often the tags conflict? I may be talking nonsense here.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nDibyendu"
