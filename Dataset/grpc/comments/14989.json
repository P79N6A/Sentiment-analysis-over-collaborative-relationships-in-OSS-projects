    "body": "Hi @mehrdada , I noticed that \"pip install --upgrade google-cloud\" is currently broken on my system due to this issue. Looks like the command resolves to \"grpcio-1.11.0rc1.tar.gz\", which probably doesn't have the fix.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[...]\r\nDownloading/unpacking grpcio<2.0dev,>=1.0.2 (from google-gax<0.16dev,>=0.15.7->google-cloud-bigtable<0.29dev,>=0.28.1->google-cloud)\r\n  Downloading grpcio-1.11.0rc1.tar.gz (14.2MB): 14.2MB downloaded\r\n[...]\r\nthird_party/address_sorting/address_sorting.c:41:38: fatal error: address_sorting_internal.h: No such file or directory \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis might be slightly off-topic, but as a pip noob, I'm wondering whether there's a way to instruct `pip` to incorporate this fix as a workaround until the next release is rolled out (or to use an older version without this issue)."
