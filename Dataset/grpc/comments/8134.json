    "body": "The \"end\" event just indicates that there are no more incoming messages. It contains no information about whether the call was successful.\n\nIf you want the client to receive a single final success or failure response, I would recommend using the \"status\" event, which contains that information. If you really need the Error object when a stream fails, you can return a success response when you get an OK status event, and a failure response when you get an \"error\" event. Those two possibilities are mutually exclusive.\n\nEither way, you should do something to handle the \"error\" event, because the default stream error handler throws the error.\n"
