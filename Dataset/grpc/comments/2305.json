Can you please describe more in detail what issues you've been seeing?\n\nRegarding the System.Collections.Immutable - yeah, it looks like that one was finally released as stable and consequently, Microsoft.Bcl.Immutable was hidden from nuget.org. But, nuget packages that depend on  the hidden package should still work without any problem (you won't be able to locate the package when searching for it, but it's still there and visual studio downloads it just fine).\n"
