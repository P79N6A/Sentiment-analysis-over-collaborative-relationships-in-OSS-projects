The reason was likely those pods you used were using BoringSSL that gRPC depended on, but they did not explicitly specify the dependency in their podspec. We recently renamed the BoringSSL lib to avoid conflict with other openssl libraries, which can cause issue in this case."

After I update them to openssl_grpc, the archiving works.\r\n\r\nMy theory is that if you have worked with earlier version boringSSL, your project will explicitly have the openssl framework setting. Even after you update to the new version, for some reason the flag hasn't been changed. That explain why muxi don't have that issue on a new project.\r\n\r\nIf you have linked an earlier version BoringSSL (in my case that's TokenSdk 1.0.99) then switch to the newest version , you will suffer that problem. @petard Hope this works for you too."
