    "body": "I know a bunch of people who have been wanted to try gRPC on .NET Core since the 1.0 a few days ago even if it's as an alpha, but they haven't been able to figure out how.\n\nI've taken a recent commit, and published it under [`X.Grpc.Core`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/X.Grpc.Core) with .NET Core support (in the state that you guys have it in). I'm writing here so that other people who find this issue wanting to try it out have an easy way to do so, and to check with you guys that publishing the package is OK with you. Please let me know if you don't think this is acceptable.\n\nI've been using the packages on CoreCLR without any issues for the past week, so I'm pretty happy with the state that it's in.\n\nYou can use it by specifying `\"X.Grpc\": \"1.1.0-dev-20160826\"` in your project.json in place of `\"Grpc\": \"1.0.0\"` as the examples direct, and everything else should work as per the examples.\n\nThe complete list of packages that I've published today is [`X.Grpc`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/X.Grpc), [`X.Grpc.Core`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/X.Grpc.Core), [`X.Grpc.Auth`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/X.Grpc.Auth), I'll keep them up to date as changes are made to this repo.\n\nThanks for your work supporting .NET and .NET Core, as always.\n"

    "body": "Agreed, will definitely unpublish those packages once support is official. Wish NuGet had a better way to propagate deprecation notices when checking for updates (\"this package is obsolete, please go here instead\"). I've been left hanging a bunch of times while checking for updates for corefx packages, where new versions of a library are published at a new name and not the old.\n\nOn my experience with gRPC on CoreCLR, I've been using it in a system that performs about 500 million RPCs a day and it's been great! No issues whatsoever on the stability side! Thanks so much for making it work.\n\nI'm somewhat concerned about the performance in that I wish it'd scale better to more cores, closer to the C++ and Java implementations. The performance dashboard suggests that there's contention somewhere\nsince the C# implementation tops out at 20k QPS on both 8 and 32 core unary call tests (vs 500k for Java and 1.5m for C++). I haven't yet tried to find and resolve it myself, but before doing so I'm not sure where to ask about how you currently feel about performance and where you want it to be.\n"
