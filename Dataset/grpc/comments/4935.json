    "body": "Coming soon to a release branch near you: #4755 was merged to master and addresses this (insofar as symptoms go - the alpha code is still in the runtime but will be removed Soon™). The protoc plugin is currently distributed in a different way, and so an updated version would come from wherever you got the gRPC core (but, it too will soon be shoved into a PyPI package Soon™).\n\nAs far as I know, the only current way to get the above niceties is by [working off of the master branch](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/4961#issuecomment-176809285). They should all be present come version 0.13.0, however.\n\nFeel free to re-open if I missed anything!\n"
