    "body": "Ah, I see.\r\n\r\nMaybe _unsecure shouldn't exist in the first place; there could just be grpc(++), which does or does not have SSL support, configurable through a build flag. But that's a rather big hammer that would break half the world just to fix this minor annoyance.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the reflection library does indeed have to depend on one of them? Can it be left up to the user to build and link either grpc++ or grpc++_unsecure if they use grpc++_reflection? This might not even break so much, because it seems unlikely that anyone links solely with grpc++_reflection and relies on its dependencies to be pulled in automatically.\r\n\r\nBut with the broad spectrum of build systems and platforms supported by gRPC, such a change is probably far more difficult than I imagine. So I'll just close this. Thank you for your consideration!"
