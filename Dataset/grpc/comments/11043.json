    "body": "Hope this is helpful, I was debugging this issue (or one like it) for the ruby and python clients, and captured trace logs of the error occurring.\r\n\r\n## Test Method\r\nThe test is pretty simple\r\n1. Issue first RPC\r\n2. Restart server\r\n3. Issue second RPC\r\n\r\nI did this manually by having the client sleep 15 seconds between RPCs, and manually restarting the server between calls.\r\n\r\nThe tests were run from the [ruby:2.3.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/ruby/tags/2.3.1/) and [python:3.5.2](https://hub.docker.com/r/library/python/tags/3.5.2/) docker images.\r\n\r\nThe test used the helloworld example from the grpc repo, with modified [ruby](https://gist.github.com/marshallbrekka/382e18317df71801b06e003ac227b79a) and [python](https://gist.github.com/marshallbrekka/7dbc7e7eb65c5701149be2ab01b1a815) clients, run with the environment vars\r\n- `GRPC_TRACE=connectivity_state,channel,http,tcp`\r\n-  `GRPC_VERBOSITY=debug`\r\n\r\nThe problem exists for the [ruby gem version 1.2.5](https://rubygems.org/gems/grpc/versions/1.2.5), and the [python package version 1.3.0](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/grpcio/1.3.0), however building the [ruby gem from source on 1.3.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/wearefair-grpc/versions/1.3.1.pre.c) does not contain the issue (building from source on 1.2.5 still does).\r\n\r\nBuilding python from source on 1.3.1 still failed, which lead me to believe that [this PR](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/10670) potentially had the side effect of fixing the issue for Ruby.\r\n\r\n## Logs\r\nThe logs have been annotated with markers of significant events, all prefixed by `### NOTE`.\r\n\r\n- [Ruby: 1.2.5 - FAIL](https://gist.github.com/marshallbrekka/08025c5c60cf3453a60f0299cdd3b66a)\r\n- [Ruby: 1.3.1 - SUCCESS](https://gist.github.com/marshallbrekka/8b327256c4c57e4a8d1847fe6c47c1b7)\r\n- [Python: 1.3.0 - FAIL](https://gist.github.com/marshallbrekka/abfd4b5a08de8c78f15cef7ad304d61d)\r\n"

    "body": "@jtattermusch It has been a rough few days but I believe this is because of my current setup. I am using Grpc 1.8.3 in C#. I am using Kubernetes pods to host all my clients and servers in a microservice architecture. I believe the problem is because each kubernetes service has multiple pods meaning that the dns remains the same but the IP address changes continuously. So these idle channels simply \"loose\" its connection. So I decided to rather construct a new channel for each \"scope\" of work and destroy the channel afterwards using ShutdownAsync. The problem is ShutdownAsync takes around 12 seconds to finish !? This however seemed to solve the \"Unavailable\" problem however I get Status(StatusCode=Unknown, Detail=\"Stream removed\") instead."

    "body": "Thanks @jtattermusch, I will check that out and let you know. Just two quick questions maybe you can help me with.\r\n\r\n1) Unary async calls are just awaited and stream calls are disposed with \"using\". Is there anything else I need to do to clean up the calls naturally? I can't seem to find anything in the samples.\r\n\r\n2) Do you think setting up channels on a per scope basis is better than long lived channels where IP address could change during an IDLE state?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help, its much appreciated."

    "body": "1.  the native objects held by client-side call objects will be cleaned up when status is received from server and you have no pending operations on the call.  What Dispose() does is that it cancels the call if it hasn't finished yet, which results in status from server being delivered soon afterward (and the call is cleaned up).\r\nWith streaming calls you should always finish reading the response stream (MoveNext()) until the call finishes successfully or you get RpcException with status - abandoning the reponse stream can lead to call not being cleaned up properly.\r\n\r\n2. That really depends on your application. In general, short lived channels have more overhead (creating a TCP connection) but you of course cannot have streaming calls survive things like change of backend's IP (as you seem to be describing). For long-lived streaming calls, you should always have a way to terminate the call gracefully and start a new one (that's necessary for things like loadbalancing to work properly)."
