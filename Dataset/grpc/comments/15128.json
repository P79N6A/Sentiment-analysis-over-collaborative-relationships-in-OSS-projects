    "body": "So, well, your PR partially nullifies the `#if` statement that is right below: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/include/grpc/impl/codegen/port_platform.h#L44\r\n\r\nThe point is, and the main design paradigm around gRPC is that we want to be as boring as possible, and follow the [principle of least surprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) as much as possible. Following this principle means that the user needs to be fully explicit about what is going on in their code, and this condition here is to force the user to somehow explicitly define the version of the Windows API they want to use without us forcing one by default and hence polluting their environment, creating a weird situation where parts of their code is compiled for one version, and parts of their other code is compiled for another version.\r\n\r\nLong story short, this means the easiest way, and in my opinion the most correct way, is for you to always define `_WIN32_WINNT` from the compilation flags. Note that while this isn't necessarily the default from what Visual Studio does, but this is something that I personally consider to be best practice, and [I'm not the only one with this stance](https://github.com/weidai11/cryptopp/issues/178#issuecomment-233405697).\r\n\r\nThis is the only way to ensure no discrepancy across the project is happening, thus ensuring the principle of least surprise I was talking about before. In fact, the way you got bitten by this tells me that you would otherwise have been silently be using two different versions of the WINNT API inside the same project, which is just wrong.\r\n\r\nAll of this being said, maybe the right thing to do would be to try and get the code generator to not end up including `port_platform.h`. I now wonder what causes this to happen."

    "body": "Yeah I should have removed the `#ifndef` part of the conditional compilation check.\r\n\r\nMy original intention to include `windows.h` earlier is that it keeps the user the choice to target a specific API version, but also could use the default API version that matches what is used in their project. So if a user want to target a specific API version, they will explicitly define `_WIN32_WINNT` for their own whole project; if a user only want to target the current API version in their environment, they'll leave it to the default.\r\n\r\nBut your concern also makes sense. It sounds better if we could avoid including this header in the generated C++ files. I'll investigate the possibility."

    "body": "I spent some time expanding the head inclusion tree of the generated `.grpc.pb.cc` file and the results is attached, where a `+` sign means that the header will be included, a `-` sign means that the header will be skipped due to a previous inclusion, and a `*` sing is the inclusion of `port_platform.h`.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: The main header files including `port_platform.h` are: `grpc/impl/codegen/byte_buffer.h`, `grpc/impl/codegen/core_codegen_interface.h`, `grpc/impl/codegen/propagation_bits.h`. It seems to me that there is no easy way to remove the inclusion. @nicolasnoble Thoughts?\r\n[port_platform_dependency.txt](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/files/1973088/port_platform_dependency.txt)\r\n"

Pinging @apolcyn for this.\r\nThen, this is the only actual file that contains problematic things: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/include/grpcpp/impl/codegen/core_codegen_interface.h\r\n\r\nAll of the gpr_mu and gpr_cv things might actually just pointers in there, in virtual functions, so the full definition isn't really needed. @vjpai, what do you think ?"
