    "body": "Hi, vcpkg maintainer here!\r\n\r\n> Who maintains the vcpkg definition for gRPC?\r\n\r\nSimilar to Homebrew, Vcpkg relies on community contributions for portfiles (Formulas). We don't assign direct ownership and welcome improvements from any and all users.\r\n\r\n> How do we know it works well right now and that it will continue to be maintained in the future?\r\n\r\nIt would seem it works well for @dalebrubaker :). More seriously, vcpkg is officially relied upon by other Google projects such as https://github.com/google/guetzli.\r\n\r\nWe have had 7 unique users contribute to our GRPC port, which I interpret to be healthy with a high probability of active maintenance in the future.\r\n\r\n>The removal of /vsprojects should simplify things and allow us to focus more on cmake improvements.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is that even with a _perfect_ CMake file, dependencies acquisition will be problematic. This is (in my opinion) the primary draw of tools such as Vcpkg and why it would still be worth listing as an option even as you continue to improve the core buildsystem!"

    "body": "@ras0219-msft Thanks for this. Note that #10699 seems to be the current open issue for this. Question for you. I don't see guetzli listed on your ports page, and they have an appveyor script at https://github.com/google/guetzli/blob/20193b6663656894412561f03839de768fd120e0/appveyor.yml that seems to \"directly\" install onto a machine. Is there a way to automate the porting of grpc at every release? Thanks."
