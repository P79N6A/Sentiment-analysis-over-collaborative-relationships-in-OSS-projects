    "body": "@varshanbp, the benefits of deprecation (unless there's a compelling reason for keeping them, and you haven't provided one):\r\n- Maintaining another build solution costs time and effort (a nontrivial amount of it). We'd much invest our time into making one build solution great rather than supporting two build systems that \"kind of\" work.\r\n- Visual Studio projects need to be continuously tested. Such testing solution needs to be maintained and it also costs resources to run those tests.\r\n- Giving people the choice to use pre-generated VS projects might actually be harmful to them. As described in the PR, the pregen VS projects have limitations and are known to be partially broken and incomplete."
