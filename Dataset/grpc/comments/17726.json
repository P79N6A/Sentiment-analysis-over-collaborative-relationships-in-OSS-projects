    "body": "@chhsia0 what older systems do you have in mind? AFAIK gRPC requires ALPN to function properly so an NPN-only build is fine in your own fork, but doesn't make that much sense in upstream.\r\n\r\nBesides that OpenSSL has had ALPN support for quite a while and we can't possibly support every possible build option out there - and this one seems pretty low on the list.\r\n\r\n@nicolasnoble any opinions?"
