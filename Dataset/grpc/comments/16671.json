    "body": "Ok, so there is a clause hidden deep in the C++ standard that says that \"an unnamed parameter of type void as the only item in the [parameter] list specifies that the function has no parameters\" . So technically either form is equivalent if there are no other arguments and the void has no name; this was probably put in the standard just to avoid breaking old C code being built using C++ compilers. That said, it should be viewed as a deprecated special case and not encouraged (IMO); none of our readability examples use this form.\r\n\r\nAs to how the compilers match them: the compilers match using their IR, not a simple text form (this also handles cases like default parameter values or unnamed parameters in declarations or even typedefs), and the IR for C indicating a function with C linkage and an explicit `(void)` in the parameter list would be the same as that in C++ for a function with C linkage and an empty parameter list.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I just realized that I didn't address the question you asked. Since the header file says that this particular overload of the function has `extern \"C\"` linkage, the compiler would compile it with C linkage even though those specific words aren't repeated in the source file. There could still be C++ overloads of the same function name with different parameters, but we would never do such a thing. That would be hideous.\r\n"
