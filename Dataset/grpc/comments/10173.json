    "body": "I don't think gRPC supports anything like HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables (how did you hear about that?).  https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/environment_variables.md\r\n\r\nAlso, gRPC protocol is using HTTP/2 (as opposed to HTTP1.1 - which might be what your proxy actually supports). More work would be needed to get the scenario working - you can file a feature request for gRPC as a whole to support proxies (it's not a C# specific feature) and you'll need to provide more technical details, but AFAIK we have no plans in that direction.\r\nMeanwhile, I will close this issue because it's not an actual problem with gRPC."
