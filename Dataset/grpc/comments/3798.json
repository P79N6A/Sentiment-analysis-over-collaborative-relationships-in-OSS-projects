    "body": "- Please read the docs on [RVM](http://rvm.io).  RVM is not used for temporary testing, it's about managing an entire ruby environment.  E.g, you could set up cocoapods in an rvm environment and alway switch to that environment whenever you wanted to use cocoapods.  This is better than installing cocoapads to the system; even without this issue with gRPC, it means that always have a separate problem of ensuring that the dependencies of any other ruby package that is installed are consistent with those used by cocoapod's.  That's the problem the [RVM](http://rvm.io) or [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) solves.\n- The reason #4020 replaces this bug, is because it's being resolved by #4120, which ensures that you don't need to upgrade the system ruby when its version 2.0; you can just use it. \n"
