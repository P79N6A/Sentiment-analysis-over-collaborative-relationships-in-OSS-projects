    "body": "This is a good point. Currently, required parameters are before the callbacks, and optional parameters are after them. This makes some simple usages of the API look a little cleaner, but I understand that that doesn't help if it breaks some tools. I think this changes is probably worth making.\n\nI don't think that returning a promise is the correct thing to do here, though. Node currently does not have a single official promise API, and gRPC should not be dictating what kind of promises its users use.\n"
