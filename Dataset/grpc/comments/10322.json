    "body": "We don't have retries yet, so it's not that. I suspect this is some weird interaction between Node internals and the way gRPC does network connection attempts.\r\n\r\nOne thing worth trying is explicitly closing the gRPC client when you're done with it, by calling `grpc.closeClient(service)`. Those clients do create network resources, and it's not always possible to guarantee that those resources will be released by the garbage collector in a reasonable amount of time."
