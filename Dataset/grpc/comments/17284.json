    "body": "In our application we will specify the source interface for each GRPC connection and the expectation is that the GRPC connection will use the VRF and source IP of that interface. To achieve this we need an option in GRPC to set vrf/namespace and source IP. \r\n\r\nThis feature will be useful in case the destination GRPC server IP is resolved through multiple interface.  User configures a source interface, through which the GRPC packet should be sent out (by setting the source IP of that interface in the packet source IP field). \r\n\r\nTemporarily we have used setns option to set the namespace. We are also not able to set multiple namespace/vrf for different GRPC connection. Is that expected GRPC behavior?"
