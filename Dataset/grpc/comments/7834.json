The server cert validation is done by the inner logic of gRPC in the handling of the TLS protocol (according to HTTPS semantics in this case) without giving the application the opportunity to change the behavior except for some very limited use cases limited to testing such as the SSL_TARGET_NAME_OVERRIDE and it is probably safer this way.\r\nHowever logging of the certs used on the server from the client is a good use case for such an API."

However, I don't like it too much since pinning is fragile (what happens if the key for a given domain is rotated for valid reasons). [Certificate transparency](https://www.certificate-transparency.org/) is a much better option for protecting against CAs that issue certs for domains they should not issue certs for. I can see a future where we have a plugin to support certificate transparency on the validation path.\r\n\r\nOpening the validation to application code is dangerous because this is not a well understood topic and will lead to applications not doing the right thing.

When I read both the relevant threads, back in October, it seemed clear that the Google guys felt that \"our way or the highway\" was appropriate.

B/c really, GRPC's shit is weak.\r\n\r\nETA: in case it's not clear, I also asked for this to be fixed -- to enable passing the relevant callback down thru the GRPC layer to Node.JS' TLS layer.  As I understand it, there's a patch somebody wrote, that makes this possible.  But since I was only using GRPC with a client, and I've stopped working with that client, I no longer care.

    "body": "Preface: I want to make it clear that I have no beefs with the -quality- of GRPC.  I'm sure it's excellent code, and certainly I encountered no bugs in my use.  My beef is with the -aims- of GRPC, and what is and is not deemed \"in scope\".\r\n\r\n@thisisnotapril  I think if you look at this comment: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/7834#issuecomment-288785780 wherein @jboeuf says \"let's agree to disagree then .... I will not approve of any APIs that opens the raw validation path to application code\", it seems clear that the goal of GRPC is a vertically-integrated stack, wherein developers are prevented from \"shooting themselves in the foot.\"  Now, that's great, when you're dealing with people writing clients, and esp. clients that talk to some large body of existing services like ... say .... Google.\r\n\r\nBut if you're building your own services, that's just inappropriate.  And it isn't just that NodeJS GRPC (1) doesn't allow me to specify logic for mutual TLS auth (via something like Golang's VerifyPeerCertificates), though that's already bad.\r\n\r\n(2) more generally, GRPC is (in neither JS nor Golang, and hence, I conjecture in every language) not structured so I can substitute my own \"transport\", e.g. a transport that uses a different form of encryption.\r\n\r\n  --> why might I want this?  Well, SSL is both weak and slow.  There at least some good reasons to think that NaCl (libsodium) is much better.  But I can't use it with GRPC; I -can- use it with Thrift, b/c Thrift as a separation between \"transports\" (byte-streams), \"protocols\" (details of type marshaling), Processors (details of RPC service marshaling), and server-skeletons, which take care of threads, connection-initiation and -termination, etc.\r\n\r\n  --> BTW, a while back somebody asked if GRPC might be factored so that he could perform the (server-side) \"accept\" logic (and creation of a connection) and then hand it to GRPC to run RPCs across it.  The answer (of course) was \"no way, man\".  What this guy wanted, to was to replace the \"server-skeleton\" with his own; in Thrift, this is trivial.\r\n\r\n  --> for instance, I once wrote a thrift application where process A TCP-connects to process B, and then process A accepts and processes RPCs from process B (the backwards of the normal case).  Such a mode would be impossible with GRPC.\r\n\r\n  --> another example: process A forks process B, and then wants to run RPCs to process B.  The -safest- way to do this is for process A to create a socketpair() before the fork.  But if you do that, you can't use GRPC to run those RPCs.  With GRPC, process B would have to set up a server-socket, and process A would connect to it.  That's less secure, more cumbersome, more steps, and impossible to test all the failure-modes of.  Gee, that's BRILLIANT!\r\n\r\n(3) The fact is, GRPC (in golang & JS) runs over HTTP[S], and nothing but.  And gosh, that means you don't get any sort of thread-affinity between the client & server threads -- b/c it's not guaranteed, and even if it were, it's entirely possible that the connection could be closed and reopened between requests\r\n\r\n  --> BTW, this makes Andrew's request even more paramount.  He's thinking \"gee, I could do my own phase of authentication after SSL does its stuff\" but he's forgetting that he has no visibility to the closing/reopening of TCP/SSL connections.  So even if he did that auth, it might turn out that the NEXT RPC went to a thread where that auth work wasn't known.\r\n\r\n  --> Of course, if you write your server in Golang, you don't have any sort of thread-local state, and since the \"server-skeleton\" doesn't provide any, you basically have to write apps that need conversational state as if they're running in a web server.  Which is the point, isn't it?  B/c GRPC is basically only designed as a way for clients to access web-apps.\r\n\r\n  But that's not what it's advertised as, is it?  It's -advertised- as being some general-purpose RPC framework.\r\n\r\n(4) I've used Thrift extensively, writing a transport that runs over Infiniband, and doing quite a few other interesting things.  None of that would be possible with GRPC, without doing massive surgery, and hence a massive fork.  Whereas in Thrift, it was just another Transport class.\r\n\r\nI'll stop here.  B/c honestly, I can understand why Google does not and will not fix these things.  After all, none of these changes would make it any easier to access Google's services.  Instead, they would make it easier to build services of one's own."
