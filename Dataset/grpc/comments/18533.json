    "body": "One thing that sticks out here is that `ares_strsplit.c` is added in c-ares 1.15 release, and the 1.19.1 grpc release is pinned to the 1.13 c-ares release, at least in it's submodule.\r\n\r\nI want to say that what's happening here is a \"submodule build\", but against a different version of c-ares than the grpc Makefile is meant to do a submodule build against.\r\n\r\nHow exactly are you compiling? Did you run `git submodule update`?"
