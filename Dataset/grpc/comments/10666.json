    "body": "So most of this data is already available in the Jenkins UI (e.g. https://grpc-testing.appspot.com/job/gRPC_master_linux/2108/testReport/(root)/c++_linux_dbg_native/). It's missing the CPU cost/estimated but that might be easy to add to the JUnit XML? \r\n\r\nI think a dashboard could easily be built by running a continuous Jenkins job that scrapes master jobs' results and stores in BQ. We already did something similar to this, so I could put some time to make this."
