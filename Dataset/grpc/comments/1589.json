    "body": "It is arguable though that the library then becomes the extension itself. This is similar to what we were talking about yesterday with @soltanmm with the Python extension. The goal is that people should be able to do a gem install or a pip install on the directory, and let the setup do its work. If it deems necessary to embed the full grpc library in it, then so be it. A one-liner to install the extension, without additional hassle.\n\nAs far as portability is concerned, mkmf creates a makefile itself, meaning that having \"make\" is a non-negotiable requirement from any extconf.rb around. Meaning that invoking make should always work.\n"

    "body": "So with bundler 1.10.0, and when that pull request is merged, it will be possible to directly install the grpc gem from git, even without grpc installed on the system, using the following:\n\n```\ngem 'grpc', :git => 'https://github.com/grpc/grpc.git', submodules: true, glob: 'src/ruby/*.gemspec'\n```\n"
