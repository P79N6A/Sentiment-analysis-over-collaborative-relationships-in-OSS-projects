    "body": "It looks like the problem is that a pick is coming in right after we've shut ourselves down due to the selected subchannel going into state SHUTDOWN.  This is essentially due to a race condition between the SHUTDOWN connectivity state notification and the pick.\r\n\r\nOnce @AspirinSJL is ready to merge #12829, this problem will go away, since we will no longer be shutting down the LB policy when the subchannel goes to state SHUTDOWN.  However, since I don't know how quickly we'll be able to merge that PR, I'll put together a short-term solution.\r\n\r\nI'm going to add a check to `pf_pick_locked()` such that if the LB policy is shutting down, we immediately fail the pick.  This change will no longer be necessary once #12829 is merged, so we can delete it as part of that PR."
