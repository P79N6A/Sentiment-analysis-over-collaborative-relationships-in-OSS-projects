    "body": "@matt-kwong  I really think we do need to preserve the ability to version our dockerimages (currently we do that by sha1 of the Dockerfile and it's been working fine for us) so we can handle people running PRs and release branches against different versions of the docker image.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd like to avoid building docker images as part of our builds - this would bring a large variance into duration of our tests and that seems contraproductive when we are trying to decrease the overall runtime of our test suites. In general, introducing unpredictability (e.g. there will be a latency between merging a PR and the pre-build docker image becoming available and in the meantime, you'll need to rely on building the base docker image, so you will get random job timeouts unless you set the job timeouts really high and you don't want that) is bad IMHO. The current approach might be a bit extra work for those few PRs that change the dockerfiles, keeps everything very predictable and easy to reason about. I don't quite see what the new approach would give us."
