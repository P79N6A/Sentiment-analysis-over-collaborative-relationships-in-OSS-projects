The goal though will be to have TLS\nbindings that are compatible with spiffe and  would allow you to implement\nthe semantics that you want, and this we will do in the gRPC repo.\nIn the meantime, if you need this feature (even in a hackish state), it\nseems to me that you can completely drive it from application code.\n\nDoes that make sense to you?\n\nOn Thu, Jun 15, 2017 at 4:29 PM, Augusto Roman <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> *@augustoroman* commented on this pull request.\n> ------------------------------\n>\n> In examples/ruby/mutual_auth/client.rb\n> <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/10529#discussion_r122217088>:\n>\n> > +  certs = load_test_certs\n> +  GRPC::Core::ChannelCredentials.new(certs[0], certs[1], certs[2])\n> +end\n> +\n> +def main\n> +  host_override = 'foo.test.google.fr'\n> +  OptionParser.new do |opts|\n> +    opts.on('--server_host_override HOST_OVERRIDE',\n> +\t    'override the SSL target host name.') do |v|\n> +      host_override = v\n> +    end\n> +  end.parse!\n> +\n> +  # NEVER override the target hostname in a production environment.

Maybe `src/ruby/spec/client_server_auth`.\r\n\r\n* Probably add the `openssl` gem as a development dependency in [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/grpc.gemspec#L33)\r\n\r\n* We should probably convert the protobuf types here to use [these generated protobufs](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby/pb/src/proto/grpc/testing)\r\n\r\n  * those protobuf could  be `required` in the test file similarly as is done in [this test](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/pb/test/client.rb#L40)\r\n\r\nSince this is using security features that are intended for tests, IMO this would fit best if it was just a test itself (docs and helpful pointers could still refer to it).\r\n\r\nPLMK if this sounds ok to do.\r\n\r\nthanks for the content so far."
