    "body": "Hey @ikishchenko,\r\n\r\nThis issue doesn't seem to be Bazel or gRPC related. I couldn't reproduce this issue myself, but searching around for this error hints that this might be showing up due to a misformatted/corrupt Python egg that might be existing on your machine. Did you have any luck trying to uninstall and reinstall 'httplib2' (which seems to be the source of the error here)? [There is a SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17985110/errors-while-installing-python-packages) with some steps to debug a very similar issue. Can you please report back with results?\r\n\r\nAlthough on a different note, it is indeed bad for our build to fail because of such discrepancies in a user's Python install. The Python rules for Bazel are still a huge WIP and are seemingly not yet fully sandboxed (since Bazel sees and uses Python packages installed in the current environment). There are [some ongoing discussions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A6J3j3y1SQ0HliS86_mZBnB5UeBe7vExWL2Ryd_EONI/edit#heading=h.onyijsxsw1p2) to achieve this, but a perfect solution might still be very far away."
