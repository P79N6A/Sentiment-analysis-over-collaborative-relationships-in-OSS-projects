    "body": "Status update on this: Changes in the most recent `h2` package on pip also broke the http2 test server and its health check mechanism. Setting the dockerfile to install `h2` at version 2.6.1 gets the tests passing locally; still waiting for Jenkins to see if any other issues pop up. It's probably also a good idea to hardcode the versions of twisted and h2 that are installed to avoid this type of issue in the future, but will consider that in a separate PR."
