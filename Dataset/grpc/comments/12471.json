Looking at the PR again,\r\ngiven that F# support is not something we are actively working on, I think it might make sense to put the F# example to different repository (your own one would be the simplest, or perhaps add under the https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/ organization. There's also https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/awesome-grpc repository where we could add a link to the F# example).\r\n\r\nWould you be interested in publishing a blog about how to setup gRPC C# with F# projects?"
