The testing infrastructure is pretty complex.\n\nI suspect I can get to the stage where I can build it and then run the tests from a command-line, and then @jtattermusch can hopefully integrate that into the build system. Will do that first part as a PR (which Jan can then adopt as the basis for the full one).\n"

    "body": "Urgh. I got a fair way through, to the extent that I was able to run tests again, but then they failed due to failing to find the native library. While I'm sure we _could_ get this working independently of #7282, I suspect in reality it'll be simpler to do both at once.\n\n(I first started this because my Linux box is Ubuntu 16.04, which wasn't supported pre-RTM for .NET Core, so I couldn't run the tests for the other PR...)\n"
