    "body": "grpc-testing really wants to test this :)\r\n\r\nPast that, thanks everyone for taking a look at this. I have a few questions on this PR:\r\n\r\n1) Should I setup the directory structure like this? Since a lot of the code can be shared with the php directory (like all the tests) it may be better to place this under the PHP folder in some way. I also haven't added any different tests here since all the same ones from the php library can be used.\r\n\r\n2) I have been working through a few remaining segfaults and memory issues and have gotten stuck. For instance the following stack trace (https://gist.github.com/RyanGordon/d812dbe22d599ce5d54365c5f64b205c) has plagued me and may be related to calling `vm_call_user_func` (https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11553/files#diff-b162b6e5f93a243a83db41b6aa4fa912R124) in some form and memory not being set properly. There's also a separate segfault that happens and I haven't been able to locate why yet: https://gist.github.com/RyanGordon/31246ced243d72bf2fbd1fa48f4cb3b5\r\n\r\nAny theories or help on the segfault/error would be greatly appreciated."

Does that mean the HHVM extension will work with the PHP `lib/Grpc` code? And I suppose same for all the unit tests as well? So this PR really only needs the HHVM C extension?\r\n\r\n2. What's the use of the `composer.json` in this context? That is only used to pull in other packages dependency to run the PHP lib code right? Coz there's no PHP code, per se, to submit this as a composer package right?\r\n\r\n3. We are still deciding on the folder structure. But now that it appears that this PR will only have the HHVM C extension as \"new code\". I am leaning towards putting this in the `grpc/src/php/ext` subtree. What do you think?"

Yes, it turns out the code in `lib/Grpc` doesn't need any changes for it to run in hack and the header isn't necessary unless we're adding typing information. I removed the folder for those reasons. I do have a separate file to run HHVM unit tests locally, since I am not sure how to setup the hhvm framework for the CI. It also appears the `autoload.php` that the php unit tests reference isn't in this repo, so I just used my own autoloader instead to run tests.\r\n\r\n2. It does look like `composer.json` is indeed not needed in this PR (No differences from the PHP composer package); I will remove it.\r\n\r\n3. That sounds correct to me. Should we put it under `grpc/src/php/ext/hhvm`?"

It appears as if this behavior will [not be supported](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/issues/2827#issuecomment-172046327) by HHVM.\r\n\r\nMy question is, is there a way to workaround this behavior in gRPC? Ideally, I would like any gRPC calls to come back to the same thread that the HHVM request is running on, rather than executing any HHVM application code under a different thread. Is this possible?"
