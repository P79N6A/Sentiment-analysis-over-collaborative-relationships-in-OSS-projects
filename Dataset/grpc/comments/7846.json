The interop test descriptions doc doesn't say anything about a test for max message size:\n\nhttps://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/interop-test-descriptions.md\n\nFurthermore, since no interop tests failed in any other languages, I assume that none of the other languages are doing this.

    "body": "It seems like a bad idea to test this kind of thing from the interop test framework, because that doesn't allow you to change parameters on the client and server on a per-test basis.  For example, I can presumably fix the immediate problem by increasing the send-size limit on the C++ server.  However, if we then also want to add a test that the server enforces its send-size limit, we can't change the server's send-size limit without breaking the objective-c tests.\n\nFor now, I'll go ahead and add a way to increase the send-size limit in the C++ API and change the interop tests to run with a higher limit.  However, in parallel with that, can you please move these tests out of the interop framework and into some other harness?  Thanks!\n"

    "body": "> It seems like a bad idea to test this kind of thing from the interop test framework, because that doesn't allow you to change parameters on the client and server on a per-test basis.\n\nThe way the ObjC tests that require a server are run, is a shell script starts the C++ interop server locally (actually two times, one with TLS and one without), and XCode is told to execute the tests in the iPhone simulator. There is no way to change parameters on a per-test basis anyway, as the tests are executed by the simulator, which has no way to start servers in the host machine. This is already separate from the interop framework we have for the other languages, in which clients and servers can be brought up in GCE.\n\n> However, if we then also want to add a test that the server enforces its send-size limit, we can't change the server's send-size limit without breaking the objective-c tests.\n\nA way to achieve this is adding a flag to the C++ server to set the limit. Then ObjC tests can run the server with a higher limit than the default. \n"
