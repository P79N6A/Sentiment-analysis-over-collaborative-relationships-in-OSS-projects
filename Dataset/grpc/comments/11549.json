    "body": "OS Version: MAC OS X 10.11.6\r\ngrpc version: master\r\nTooling: .NET Command Line Tools (1.0.4) \r\n\r\nRegarding the packages issue: With a clean install of the latest .Net Core version on OS X, dotnet restore did work for me. Make sure Greeter.sln and the needed .csproj files (one in each subdirectory of hello-world-cli) is present, and that Nuget works properly (can restore packages, can access network and feeds). Also try to empty any cache before restoring.\r\n\r\nRegarding the compilation issue: project.json files are not needed anymore to build a dotNet Core project. \"dotnet build\" in hello-world-cli root is enough to build a version (cf https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/project-json-to-csproj).

It comes with the dotNet Core installation when you install it, so you should be all set with dotnet's nuget. \r\n\r\nSince I can't reproduce your issues, here some guesses/ideas about what to do:\r\n- Check that the .sln and .csproj files are all where they should be when you try to restore. (What is bugging me is that you get a MSBUILD error).\r\n- Try to run dotnet-restore in each subdirectory.\r\n- Try to bypass caches: Remove any files that dotnet-restore might have gotten. Also remove any files that might have been added only locally (\"clean the project\") and run `dotnet-restore --nocache` (cf https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-restore)\r\n- Make a clean install of DotNet Core's latest version on your Mac."

    "body": "I just verified that `dotnet restore` on branches master and v1.4.x works fine (assuming you have an up-to-date version of dotnet installed).\r\n\r\nWhat you are seeing on v1.3.x branch is a symptom of missing and older version of dotnet SDK installed. Examples in v1.3.x are pre-csproj support (project.json style) examples, so in order to build them, you need the exact dotnet SDK version that is listed in global.json file - `1.0.0-preview2-003131`. If you don't have that version installed, dotnet SDK just ignores global.json (I think that's actually a dotnet SDK issue) and tries the default newest version of dotnet SDK installed - and the new versions of dotnet SDK don't support the project.json projects anymore - hence the error you are seeing. In v1.4.x (there'll be an official release very soon) you won't have this problem as the examples already use the new .csproj and .sln files.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# list installed dotnet SDK versions\r\nls /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/\r\n1.0.0-preview1-002702\t1.0.0-preview2-003121\t1.0.1\r\n```"
