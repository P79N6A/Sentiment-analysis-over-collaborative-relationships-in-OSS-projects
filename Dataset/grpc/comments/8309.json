    "body": "What we are doing is safe. Every configuration is running in a separate docker container (and thus has a completely different workspace).\n\nBtw, on mac and windows we obviously don't have the luxury of separating with docker, but the parallel builds are isolated by running them in a different workspace\n(see https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/tools/run_tests/run_tests_in_workspace.sh if curious).\n\nThanks for being vigilant and pointing out potential issue!\n"
