    "body": "I think there are actually two different failures happening here: \r\n\r\n* One is the error happening here and is specific to the `ExternalDnsWithTracingClientServerTest` test. What's happening here is that the test actually passes in reasonable time, but then it looks like it takes a long time to shut down. During that time, the test hits the five minute timeout and it looks like that is somehow in turn prompting the `System.Threading.ThreadAbortException` during a log message. I suspect that this failure mode is probably related to slowness of running under `GRPC_TRACE=all`.\r\n\r\n* The other error is an actual DNS resolution flake, where I've noticed more occurrences with the `ExternalDnsClientServerTest`. In that one, the RPC actually fails with a `StatusCode=Unavailable, Detail=\"DNS resolution failed\"` status. I think that this failure will be fixed by https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/17688 - I could repro before that change (~1 in 1000) and haven't been able to repro with it. Created a separate issue for this one in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/18637"
