    "body": "@ctiller and @yang-g, I'd like your specific feedback on commit c9a5474.\r\n\r\nThe ExpectErrorTest case was failing because the Status object's binary_error_details field wasn't being set, although the code and error_message fields were.  The reason for this is that the binary_error_details field is being handled differently than the other two fields; instead of being reported back directly from the recv_trailing_metadata op the way that the other two fields are, we are just getting it by looking directly in the trailing metadata map.  But since the Trailers-Only response causes the metadata to be reported in initial metadata instead of trailing metadata, this was failing.\r\n\r\nI worked around this by having the C++ CallOpClientRecvStatus object check both the trailing and initial metadata for the binary error data.  However, I am not sure this is really the best solution.  In particular, I am wondering if it would make more sense to instead track the binary error data the same way that we are tracking the other two fields.  I think this would require the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Add a new field to `grpc_op.data.recv_status_on_client` for returning the binary error details.\r\n- Add a new `GRPC_ERROR_STR_*` enum value to contain the binary error details.\r\n- Change surface/call.c to track this field at the same time that it tracks the other two.\r\n- This would probably also involve adding a static metadata key for the grpc-status-details-bin header (which might not be a bad idea anyway).\r\n\r\nThe above changes seem more invasive, but if we think that's a better approach, I will work on making those changes.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think.  Thanks!"

    "body": "When I implemented it, I considered making binary_error_details handling the same way as the existing error code and message, and I talked with @ctiller. As you said, the change would be much more invasive. Also it will be an API change at C core and all of the wrapping languages need to adapt to it (probably by adding new API to expose it or add it back to trailing metadata). I chose the way it is because we did not think the API change is well justified. "
