    "body": "This seems to be an issue with the Makefile.\r\n\r\nThe long version suffix is well-factored (e.g. `SHARED_EXT_CORE` => `so.4.0.0`) but the short version suffix is not, leading to duplication of strings matching `\\.so\\.[0-9]` throughout the file.\r\n\r\nThe filenames of the C++ libs when passed on the linker line are suffixed with `.so.1` (see [Makefile:4626 at tag `v1.6.6`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/v1.6.6/Makefile#L4626) but are suffixed with `.so.4` when the links are created (see [Makefile:2642 at tag `v1.6.6`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/v1.6.6/Makefile#L2642)) leading to this issue.\r\n\r\nThis probably happened because the short suffix is not well-factored and so someone bumped the version numbers of the C++ libraries in the link creation steps when they should have been left at `.so.1`.\r\n\r\n@timofey-retailnext If you are interested, I can find a way to upload the patch I wrote for our org, but be aware that I'm not a makefile expert and haven't fixed the same issue for the C# libs or tested this on Windows/OSX. Otherwise, hopefully Google is watching this bug and a quick fix is imminent."
