    "body": "Are you calling `grpc.loadObject` directly, or through `grpc.load`? If you're calling it directly, that implies that you are loading the proto file with Protobuf.js yourself; have you tried doing anything with the loaded object yourself to verify that it loaded correctly? If you're using `grpc.load`, you should use the alternate argument format and pass an object with `root` and `file` properties, where `root` is the path that the proto imports are relative to, and `file` is the relative path from `root` to the file that you want to load."
