    "body": "I think it's valid to a point. Right now we have extension code that compiles with modified `CFLAGS` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` when `pip install`ing for our tests, and this can cause some complications. If we are considering using the form of `requirements.txt` offered by the article:\n\n```\n--index-url https://pypi.python.org/simple/\n-e .\n```\n\nThen there are three counters I can immediately think of:\n1. Wherever we are trying to `pip install` for our tests, if we wish to use the `requirements.txt` file (and I believe this is a desirable and 'correct' use-case), we will be forced to modify our environment variables for both `grpcio` _and_ all of its dependencies. That has a small but non-zero chance of becoming a major problem not under our control in the future.\n2. We will never treat `grpcio` as an 'application', so we will never have concrete dependencies in our `requirements.txt` file.\n3. There exist two models of 'inheritance'. One can imagine 'inheritance' of concrete requirements from abstract requirements as that of a tightening or as a widening. In the case of a tightening, yes, as written this PR has a dissonance with common thought. In the case of a widening, from concrete to abstract, one can imagine that the way in which `requirements.txt` is parsed can be akin to a 'stripping down' or a 'forgetting' of concrete behaviors. This behavior isn't necessarily implemented, but it wouldn't necessarily be difficult to add onto what's here if we, for whatever reason, decided to treat `grpcio` as an 'application'.\n\nNote that I'm assuming that we _want_ to eliminate duplication. If that's not the case then, well,\n`¯\\_(ツ)_/¯`\n"
