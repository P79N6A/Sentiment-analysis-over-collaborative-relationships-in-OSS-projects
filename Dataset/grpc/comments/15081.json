We have a mechanism for staying up to date, and we also have a mechanism for making atomic changes to these protos in c core.\r\n\r\nIf a proto changes in grpc-protos, it will probably need some code changes in core. This way, those changes can go in as we bump the grpc-proto submodule, and we never have to go through a 30 minute period of breaking sanity"

I think this adds another level of syncing, since grpc_proto needs to be kept in sync with third_party submodules, and the submodule proto kept in sync with generated code.  Right now I think most of the code in core expects the protos to live in src/proto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBazel makes the second sync easy, but I don't know about make.  "
