    "body": "Thanks for reporting this. It appears that our gevent code does not respect/set `SO_REUSEPORT`, as seen [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/a554f44579b52a61891b19e3d77b23adc5e6a336/src/python/grpcio/grpc/_cython/_cygrpc/grpc_gevent.pyx.pxi#L243). I don't think the fact that `multiprocessing` is involved makes any difference: I modified your example code to `gevent.spawn` two gRPC servers in the same process and observed the same \"Address already in use\" error message.\r\n\r\nOur gevent support has a number of open bugs, and I will add this to the list. I have some time set aside this quarter to audit our gevent code and open issues, and will update this as part of that process."
