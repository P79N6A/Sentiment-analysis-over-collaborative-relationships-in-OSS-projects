    "body": "If `ok` is not true, the idea is that you can get the error from the RPC status. \r\n\r\nPreviously there were some cases where on the server we returned `ok = false` for some incoming RPCs..this is fixed now (i.e now when ok == false, it means either that the RPC failed - in which case you can get the status from the specific call...or the completion queue was shutdown..in which case even `cq_->Next` would return false)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nPlease open a gRFC with a proposal (https://github.com/grpc/proposal) if you think there are other cases where passing the error would be helpful "
