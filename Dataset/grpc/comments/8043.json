    "body": "So, I gave some thought about that one, and there might be a way to do this with some hackery - this wouldn't be trivial to plumb, but not completely crazy either.\n\nCurrently, our transport is the \"chttp2\" transport. Highly specialized transport which is optimized for the HTTP2/gRPC path only. I could imagine that we create a \"generic-http\" transport, probably much slower, but that would give the feature you want.\n\nHowever, this is a trade-off: we wouldn't be able to spend time optimizing that path, really. You'd need to understand that this alternative transport would seriously underperform compared to the main transport code. Keep in mind that I'm talking about the C core at the moment - this doesn't necessarily apply to the wrapped languages which may not perform as well as the core for the moment. So I'm not sure this is something we want to spend time on as of now, given it wouldn't really give adequate performances in the long run, and given we still have a lot of work to do in the domain of performances anyway.\n\nThe piece of advice I'd have in the interim, would be to have a form of reverse proxy (which is a piece of software I'm not yet aware exists at the moment), that'll forward the connection to different ports depending on the path being accessed. That way you can run the http2/grpc server on port A, and your generic http server on port B, and have both being visible from a front-end port.\n\nIf eventually we end up creating an alternate, generic transport http code, then you can simply remove the front-end reverse proxy and show the gRPC port directly to the outside world.\n"
