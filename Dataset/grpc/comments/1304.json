At the moment, we only plan to support PHP clients.\n\nAt some point in the future, after gRPC reaches Beta, we'd like to look at the question of PHP servers again; in the meantime we welcome ideas and suggestions about how this will work.\n\nI'll close this issue for now, but please re-open to continue the discussion with any ideas you'd like discuss for running gRPC in a PHP server.\n"
