    "body": "What you are seeing is basically a Visual Studio debugger feature - any exception being thrown in the application is noticed by VS as a \"first-chance exception\". \r\nSee https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2015/01/07/understanding-exceptions-while-debugging-with-visual-studio/.\r\nWhen you run the app stand-alone without VS, you won't see these messages being printed.\r\n\r\nA bit more detail: These exceptions are actually being thrown in the code as part of https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/11021/files, but they are expected & handled properly. It's really just a VS feature that they get printed."
