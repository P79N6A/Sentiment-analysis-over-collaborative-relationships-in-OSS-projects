    "body": "\"[::]\" does mean listen on every networks interface (with given port) in the IPv6 notation.  \"0.0.0.0\" is the equivalent for it in IPv4 (have you tried with \"0.0.0.0\"?)\r\nBoth examples you're presenting should work fine (and btw are implemented by the same piece of code in gRPC C core, so the two examples behaving differently seems very odd - perhaps there's some more differences between the scenarios -is it both linux? -  or a some other problem in the code). What exactly behavior are you getting with C#? (have you tried adding extra logging & tracing as described inhttps://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md?)\r\n\r\nI'm going to close this question for now, until we have a proof that there is an actual bug."
