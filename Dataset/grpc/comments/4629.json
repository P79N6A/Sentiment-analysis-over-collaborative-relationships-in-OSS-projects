    "body": "Thanks @zj8487 \n\n@mayflaver in our case 'grpc' and 'gevent' are transitive dependencies of gcloud-python and gunicorn respectively in our legacy app. If I was writing an app from scratch I would agree with you, but in this case these dependencies are not enforced by me. :(\nTo best of my knowledge--gunicorn with gevent as worker_class monkey patches a lot of standard library functions including threading. This conflicts with the use of \"futures\" in grpc and hangs the process.\nSince, gunicorn(w/ gevent) is quite commonly used in the industry and anyone who wanna use gcloud-python(or other grpc based libs) in their app will likely run in to the same issue. I am open to any suggestions that might help solve this issue without changing the dependencies too much. Maybe gRPC and gunicorn teams should talk and figure out a solution?\n"

From what I know, since our app is IO bound 'sync' worker does not scale well because of blocking IO.\n\n@soltanmm did your investigation conclude a root cause of the issue? Do you know what part of standard library patching was causing the hang in Python 2.7? Would excluding 'thread' from patch_all, fix the issue? I can test that myself, but I am looking for any side-effects you might know and most likely won't surface itself in a simple test. Any other information from your investigation might also help.\n"

These trip over each other when they don't cooperatively release polling to `gevent` (which at least one of them can't do because it's in gRPC core code and the core is obviously not based on `gevent`).\n\nShort of getting in-depth knowledge of `gevent` (and I'm not a `gevent` dev, so, nope), I can't come up with much more than saying, \"Excluding `thread` from monkey-patching seems to work.\"\n\nI'm not going to close this as it's _possible_ that there exists a way to force the use of standard Python threads despite monkey patching where they are necessary, or that some other hacky-solution-against-a-hacky-solution exists, but **we will not attempt to support gevent's monkeypatching** for the time being.\n"

Rolling back that assumption and moving forward with a different structure are going to be substantial work, if they're something that we ever do at all.\n\nI feel like I'm still missing quite a bit.

    "body": "Thank you @jamadden for [your investigation](https://github.com/gevent/gevent/issues/786#issuecomment-203988312).\n\nUse of the same thread, with program control passing from application to gRPC Python to the gRPC Core and then to a blocking system call is an explicit part of gRPCâ€™s design, is the basis for many of the performance improvements that weâ€™ll be making in the next few months, and would be very hard to change. In particular major alterations would have to be made to the Core to enable its completion queues to be used in the manner gevent would want to use them. Iâ€™ve spoken with @ctiller about it and this work may be scheduled engineering effort if it is forecast to be valuable enough to be prioritized above other goals.\n\nThere may be a certain recipe for monkeypatching that happens to work today but we wouldnâ€™t be able to offer proper support (with test coverage and a promise not to break in the future) for anything based around selectively patching thread pools used internally within gRPC Python. In particular we have near-term plans to scale back how widely we use thread pools. If you want today to do something based on selectively patching it may work fantastically for you and then break in a future release. I would celebrate your bravery and wish you fun.\n"
