If I understand the problem correctly, it's happening because\n> the proxy is not correctly handling server shutdown. The writes from the\n> server are not being propagated to the client during shutdown, which makes\n> me think that there is an if condition missing somewhere.\n>\nHow exactly? If my analysis in  #14471\n<https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/14471> is correct,  the proxy is doing\neverything alright -  it's actually the server that shuts down the\nconnection (it also writes GOAWAY and RST_STREAM correctly), and the proxy\ncorrectly attempts to read the data from the server. The proxy would\nforward them to the client if the read finished successfully, but the read\nfails instead (with WSAECONNABORT), and I think the reason why winsock\naborts the connections is that the proxy tries to send a ping from client\nto the server concurrently with the socket being shutdown by the server.\nIMHO the proxy cannot do much here, because until the read failure, it\nactually cannot know anything about the server shutting down (and once it\nfinds out and the socket read fails, the GOAWAY and RST_STREAM frames are\nlost on its way from server to proxy).\n\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you authored the thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/14560#issuecomment-369736409>, or mute\n> the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AJeq5EDtuU6Uh6fQ3yDpdcZGoWwCLF76ks5taGeqgaJpZM4SYk9z>\n> .\n>\n\n\n\n-- \n\nJan\n"
