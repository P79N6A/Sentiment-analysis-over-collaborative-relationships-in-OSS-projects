Hence the request for an API.\n\nYour grpc_tracer_set_enabled() proposal would be nice, esp if it came with another method to list the supported traces (which seem dynamic, in the C code).\nI see parse() called by grpc_tracer_init() is complaining when an unknown variable is passed in. That should probably be reported as an error code or something..\n"
