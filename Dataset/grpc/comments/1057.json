    "body": "The rootcause for the security code to recompile in that case is because it's building OpenSSL in-place in the third_party folder. Here's the full 9 yards of what's going on:\n1. You compile with CONFIG=dbg\n   - You don't have OpenSSL already compiled in debug mode.\n   - OpenSSL gets compiled in-place with CONFIG=dbg\n   - OpenSSL's configure script touches all of its headers.\n2. You compile with CONFIG=opt\n   - You don't have OpenSSL already compiled in release mode.\n   - OpenSSL gets compiled in-place with CONFIG=opt\n   - OpenSSL's configure script touches all of its headers.\n3. You compile with CONFIG=dbg\n   - You already have OpenSSL compiled in debug mode - no need for recompilation.\n   - credentials.c, json_token and ssl_transport_security.c all depend on OpenSSL headers\n   - However, in step 2, OpenSSL's headers got touched.\n   - Makefile's dependency tree notices that and considers these 3 files need to be recompiled.\n   - As these files are getting recompiled, the libraries need relinking.\n\nLong story short: if you want to avoid this, install OpenSSL 1.0.2 on your system.\n"
