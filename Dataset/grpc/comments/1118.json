    "body": "Well, trying to support gcc 4.4 has at least one other complication: gcc 4.4 doesn't support lambda expressions. This is hardly an issue in the main code; these are only used in thread_pool.cc . However, I believe that lambdas are heavily used in the tests (particularly the qps test!)\n\nOtherwise, I have a patch for range-based for issues ready to go.\n"
