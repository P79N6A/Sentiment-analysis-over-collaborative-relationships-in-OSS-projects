    "body": "It looks like the internal test failures were due to mocked servicers \"helpfully\" returning a dummy experimental_thread_pool, which was then being used to submit jobs. Manually fixing the test mocks requires cumbersome code like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmock_servicer = MagicMock(some_grpc_servicer)\r\ndel mock_servicer.NeedToDoThisForEveryMethod.experimental_thread_pool\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis kind of sours me on mocks in general, but AFAIK we don't provide users any guidance that they shouldn't use mocks, and it doesn't seem we want to legislate that now either way. I'd prefer to fix this forward by adding an `instanceof` check (yes, that's cumbersome too, but at least its only for our own experimental-and-internal API so seems like an ok bolt-on solution for now), which is done in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/18172"
