    "body": "@Ozaq I agree with your assesment, but it is unclear to me what can be done about this. \r\nIn cmake world, it is incorrect to perform installation of your submodules  while performing cmake install (and cmake actually wouldn't allow it, which is why autodisabling of gRPC_INSTALL has been introduced in the past) - you should install all your dependencies separately and then install grpc. This process can be simplified by e.g. using cmake's ExternalProject_Add feature.\r\n\r\nHere are examples of various (tested) ways how to install gRPC with cmake\r\nhttps://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/test/distrib/cpp Each of these approaches has its limitations, so you have to choose which \r\nI think the solution that might be best for your case it to use the cmake \"superbuild\" approach."
