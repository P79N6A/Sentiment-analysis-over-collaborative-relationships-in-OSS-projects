    "body": "Too many versions have passed. We're not merging the 1.4.x branch into master, which is now at 1.8. I am assuming the motivation here is to merge in that arguejs-related Node change. If that is the case, this merge won't help anyway, because development on the Node library has moved to the grpc/grpc-node repository. The correct course of action would be to open a PR against that repository with just the node change."
