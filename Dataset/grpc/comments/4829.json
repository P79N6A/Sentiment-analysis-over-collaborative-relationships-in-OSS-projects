    "body": "Actually, absolutely everything is broken about the distribution on master, and we missed it because I set up `tox` to build in-place when testing rather than install into the `virtualenv`.\n\nEDIT: I should qualify this: the installation always appeared to work because between the tests passing and the package installing, I'd made the erroneous assumption that our tooling was doing the Right Thing and never ran the tests on the installation (because as set up, the tests are not part of an installation, so they can't be run; this will probably change).\n\nINFO: The extension's dependencies are built by distutils, the Cython files are successfully turned into .c files, and the shared object is successfully linked. Following that, the shared object is promptly dropped on the floor.\n"
