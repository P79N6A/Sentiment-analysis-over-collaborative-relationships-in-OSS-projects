    "body": "It's true that `grpc.RpcError` specifies no useful data or behavior, but what you're missing in the documentation is that [the exception raised out of an RPC invocation isn't just a `grpc.RpcError`; it's also a `grpc.Call`](http://www.grpc.io/grpc/python/grpc.html#grpc.UnaryUnaryMultiCallable.__call__). Therefore it is legitimate (and part of the intended use case) to use the object _raised out of an RPC invocation_ according to the `grpc.Call` interface that it implements. You may notice that the object presents a few other attributes that don't fit `grpc.RpcError` or `grpc.Call` as well - because these are not guaranteed by the system that raised the object to your system, they are not legitimate to call.\r\n\r\nA much simpler example of this kind of specification-implementation would be a function that is specified to return a sequence and that has an implementation that returns a `list`. Callers of the function can call the method, introspect the returned value, see that it's a `list`, wonder why it wasn't documented as a `list`, use it according to the `list` type rather than the sequence type... and then see their code break when they update the function's library and the function's implementation changes from returning a `list` to returning some other sequence implementation. Proper implementation of a system that calls that function uses objects returned by the function only according to the sequence type that the objects are specified and guaranteed to implement."
