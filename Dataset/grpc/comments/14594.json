    "body": "I actually have a somewhat unique situation. However, it should function the same as if I were to compile `GrpcCore` VisualStudio project (with my modifications) into a `DLL` and just put that in Unity's `Plugins` directory, along with the other plugins required by GRPC. My setup looks like:\r\n\r\n1) `Omni` is an open-source network layer and data manager I'm working on. It carries no dependencies on Unity, but does support GRPC. Right now, I have all of `GrpcCore` just included into the `Omni` project as source code (copy/paste). The other libraries are loaded through NuGet as usual. This complies to a single, cross-platform `Omni.dll`.\r\n2) `Moongate` is another library, this one specific to my game, that relies upon `Omni`. The reason it is a library is that it lets me share code between my client and server. This library has dependencies on `UnityEngine`, which lets me run the config code I posted in the PR description.\r\n\r\nMy Unity project, then, just has `Omni.dll`, `Moongate.dll`, and of course the necessary Protobuf and `grpc_csharp_ext` libraries all placed in the unity `Plugins` directory."
