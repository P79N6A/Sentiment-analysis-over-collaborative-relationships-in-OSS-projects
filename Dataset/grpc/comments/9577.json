    "body": "So, I found an issue in the raspberry installation. I wasn't tracking the right branch for the protos and then, as the error says, myRpcCall is not defined because it's not a rpc call in the master branch.\r\n\r\nBut this is not obvious... Once you figure it out it makes sense. I guess there is no way to signal an error here.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
