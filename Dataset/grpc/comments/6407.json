When we get into contentionful situations we typically have other work outside the current lock that we could be doing, so when we get to a spin situation I'm jumping out of the combiner and doing them - with the idea that when we get back the spin situation ought to be resolved - and in the interim we probably got some other useful stuff done.\n\nI need to measure, but I think overall this is going to have better characteristics for us. Anyway, tempted to go with this for round 1 and try the aggregator approach once we've got everything using this lock (since it should be drop-in at that point).\n"
