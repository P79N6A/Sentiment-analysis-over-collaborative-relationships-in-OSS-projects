I am also not expecting the grpc:: version to support the full API of the std:: versions of these functions - it is just sufficient to cover the APIs that we use. For that reason, I can see sacrificing some APIs if we don't use them at all. Of my compatibility comments, I would give the most importance to the one on ~thread since that's part of the C++ standard and the proposed change would have very different behavior for threads that get destructed while still  joinable (silent passing in one case, abort in another)\n"
