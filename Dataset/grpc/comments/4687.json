    "body": "Hi @mackross,\n\nyou're right to point to that piece of documentation. It's something that worried us when we were deciding the networking stack to use. The experience of the Chrome team, though, that also uses POSIX sockets on iOS, is that that specific worry hasn't been an issue. It matches our (more limited) experience too. But of course we're eager to learn of cases when the current implementation is having problems.\n\nHaving said that, there are a number of reasons why it'd be beneficial to use a \"less raw\" networking stack than POSIX sockets. We've explored using NSURLSession (ideal), and found it can't work due to radars [26843578](https://openradar.appspot.com/26843578), [26845013](https://openradar.appspot.com/26845013), and [26846480](https://openradar.appspot.com/26846480). We've also successfully integrated Chrome's networking layer (Cronet), which gives us today a better handling of connectivity problems, plus the ability to use QUIC.\n\nWhat are your thoughts / experiences? We can use all help from people that want gRPC for iOS to be adopted :)\n"

    "body": "@jcanizales apologies for the late reply. I found porting POSIX to CFStream was pretty straight forward on a fork of an AMQP client for iOS. However, the read, write, and polling methods were all already abstracted in a similar way to the CFStream APIs.\n\nIMHO, CFStream (layer 6) is probably the right level of abstraction to move up to as it gives the OS a chance to make holistic choices about networking resources and callback timing. Furthermore, it's likely that layer 6 has or will have private implementations optimized for the current device. We already know that it uses private APIs given that it starts the radio gear and [hardware accelerated encryption is probably already on some iDevices](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4812474/does-iphone-support-hardware-accelerated-aes-encryption). This could have pretty big implications from an energy use perspective for apps that make a lot of gRPC calls. Dropping the BoringSSL dependency makes it easier for new gRPC users to get started and it also means that vulnerabilities in the encryption are now updated with the system rather than the App. Given the very fast adoption of iOS security updates and the way users think about security, this is probably a good thing.\n\nLastly IMHO, going any further up the network stack for gRPC will bring a whole heap of problems with little tangible benefits compared to the well-tested and battle hardened HTTP2 encoder/decoder that already exists in core. Especially given that NSURLSession's HTTP2 support is pretty constraining and generally badly behaved.\n"

And we could probably just reuse functions of the C core for it).\n\n@jboeuf , what are your experiences/thoughts on TLS performance, when hardware-accelerated encryption can be used vs not, and when one uses QUIC vs TCP?\n\n@makdharma does the C implementation use an abstraction over sockets (read, write, poll)? I know it does over the TLS library and over the overall network transport, but not sure if also at that level.\n"

    "body": "Hi @stephanemoore,\r\n\r\nSadly NSURLSession can't be used for gRPC, due to the radars mentioned in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/4687#issuecomment-227887528. For example, the moment your app receives HTTP trailers using NSURLSession, it crashes (CFNetwork asserts). It's really a non-starter.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning for the use of POSIX APIs not being a concern is what I explained in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/4687#issuecomment-227887528 too: Chrome for iOS hasn't seen any problem related to it in its 4+ years of public deployment. Similarly for the Google apps that have been using gRPC for almost a year.\r\n\r\nI would be thrilled to compare implementations in a quantitative way against one using NSURLSession. But that's precisely how I got to discover that we can't use NSURLSession.\r\n\r\n@mackross suggestion of a gRPC-ObjC over gRPC-C over CFStream (instead of over POSIX) sounds _feasible_ to me. @ctiller or @makdharma should be able to tell whether the C library uses internally an abstraction over sockets, so that CFStream could be plugged in.\r\n\r\nIn terms of latency, the use of QUIC makes an important difference that we've measured. That's the direction the current efforts are going."
