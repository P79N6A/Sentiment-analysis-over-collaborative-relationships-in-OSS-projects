    "body": "Very interesting. I definitely want to look at this in more detail.\nHowever, I need to stress something very important here. If a new\nconsequence of this pull request is that all public apis have to have that\nnew export symbol tag on them, we also have to have a matching sanity check\nfor it. We certainly can't accept a change that requires new constraints on\nour existing or new files unless there is a sanity check to make sure that\nthose constraints don't get violated in the future. Another less critical\nobstacle to accepting this is about testing. We certainly test for Windows\nand using cmake, but we need a detailed testing story here and a\njustification for why this is needed.\n\nThanks for your contribution, and I look forward to looking over the code.\n\nOn Thu, Mar 1, 2018, 9:52 AM gRPC Testing <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> [microbenchmarks] No significant performance differences\n>\n> â€”\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/14558#issuecomment-369674084>, or mute\n> the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AIdEkF-5IFI44xZGgQ5poOUBprc9NA3rks5taDVEgaJpZM4SYBOz>\n> .\n>\n"
