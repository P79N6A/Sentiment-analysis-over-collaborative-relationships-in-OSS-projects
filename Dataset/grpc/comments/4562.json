    "body": "So this one is tricky.\n\nI'd really like for us to use C99 style types in the source code - and maintaining two sets of types seems fraught with peril.\nI considered switching headers to unsigned long wherever we write gpr_uint32 today.\nThere are places where we take 64 bit ints however - and there's no C89 type that can express that.\n\nAFAIK, everywhere we saw problems with C99 usage had a stdint.h that had at least the basic types defined however. So I'm willing to stretch on the definition of C89 to include basic C99 types ({u,}intX_t, where X is a number).\n"
