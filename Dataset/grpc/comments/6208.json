    "body": "Ad run_test.py script:\n\nWe actually already have two cmdline utils to run the performance tests (written in C++):  qps_driver and qps_json_driver, so having an extra test driver written in python seems not to be useful. Also, we're probably trying to abandon the qps_driver approach that uses lots of cmdline arguments to configure the tests and using JSON to configure the scenarios seems to be the way to go. \n\nThat said, I think the qps_driver written in C++ is a bit of an overkill and in the future we might want to replace the qps_driver with something written in a more high-level language (perhaps python) - but there would be some extra challenges involved, so for now we will probably stick with the C++ qps_json_driver.\nCan we remove run_test.py from this PR (but let's keep the code in case we need it) and instead test the python workers with qps_json_driver?\n\nBtw, integrating python with the rest of the performance testing framework should be easy enough - \nsee https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/6204/files which is adding ruby integration (we don't need to do integration in this PR, but that's where we are aiming).\n"
