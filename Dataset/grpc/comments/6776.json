    "body": "To be honest, I'm not sure that this is worth doing.  My perception is that using IAsyncStreamReader doesn't really add any extra complexity (everyone can clearly see that it's basically an IAsyncEnumerator) and having custom type gives us a an option to add gRPC-specific xmldoc documentation to the IAsyncStreamReader type to clarify the usage (and we can also define a read-stream specific extension methods  (we actually already provide AsyncStreamExtensions.ForEachAsync and ToListAsync()).\n\nI'd say it's worth keeping the IAsyncStreamReader type and adding more documentation (general use of read streams and  and add more info on edge cases - what happens if the calls fails on client side/server side), rather then causing more pre-GA code churn by removing it.\n"

It's a purely additive change though (when\ndeclaring this as as extension method), so it can be introduced anytime\nafter GA. (Feel free to file a github issue as a request for adding this).\nAlso, in this particular case, having a the type IAsyncStreamReader  is\nuseful, because you probably don't want ToIAsyncEnumerable(this\nIAsyncEnumerator)    but ToIAsyncEnumerable(this IAsyncStreamReader) - as\nthe latter doesn't add the method to other IAsyncEnumerator instance where\nyou might not want this method (basically what I mentioned above).\n\n> â€”\n> You are receiving this because you were assigned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/6776#issuecomment-225810656, or mute\n> the thread\n> https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe/AJeq5AU9beEYRTNwoVBWt_iqEtm67DUHks5qLmMHgaJpZM4ItGzD\n> .\n"
