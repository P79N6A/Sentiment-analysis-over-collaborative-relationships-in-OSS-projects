    "body": "The tag is just a value that you can use however you want to. You can use it as a function pointer if you like, but you can also use it for any other purpose (as it is just used in async_end2end_test.cc as an integer to check the message sequence). But the basic idea is as you described it; you call the Request for each supported RPC method with context, the reader/writer structure that you use for managing the stream, the completion queue, and the tag, and then in the future you call Next (or now AsyncNext) with a pointer for the tag and the boolean ok. You should also check the return value of Next to see if it's a shutdown situation (or timeout in the case of AsyncNext).\n"
