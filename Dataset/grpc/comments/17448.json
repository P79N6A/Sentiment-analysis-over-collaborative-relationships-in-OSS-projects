    "body": "~~I am concerned that this is a broader issue that is only exposed by inproc_transport (and even then only rarely) since things happen instantaneously there. Namely: the grpc_stream structure associated with a call lives at the end of the call and is part of the call's arena, but there is no call_ref invoked at the initiation of a stream (which would then have to get unreffed at the destruction of a stream).~~\r\n\r\nMy assessment above was wrong. This issue is inproc-specific since inproc grabs a reference to the other stream but this doesn't imply a reference to the other call and its arena. For non-inproc transports, we never destroy the underlying stream until we have already destroyed the call.\r\n\r\n"
