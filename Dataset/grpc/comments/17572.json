    "body": "@meawoppl As of right now, we do not offer a public API for the version string. If you're willing to peek behind the curtain, you can use the following method to get access to it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from grpc import _grpcio_metadata\r\n>>> _grpcio_metadata.__version__\r\n'1.17.1'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's obviously not a long term solution for anyone. I'm working on a PR now to make this info available via `grpc.__version__`. If you don't mind my asking, what is your use case for this functionality?"
