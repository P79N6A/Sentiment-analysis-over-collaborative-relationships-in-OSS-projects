    "body": "From what I understand this is not grpc related, it's a protobuf issue (Consider filing on https://github.com/google/protobuf/ instead).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what is it that doesn't work. If you are trying to create an instance of Descriptor from .proto file (textual), that is actually not supported by protobuf (and it has nothing to do with gRPC itself). \r\nYou need at least binary form of the FileDescriptor (can be obtained by running protoc), but instantiating a FileDescriptor from binary data is only supported by some languages (C++, Java, ...), it's not supported in C# because C# doesn't support proto2.\r\n\r\nOne related thing you might be looking for is the protobuf type \"Any\" https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#any\r\n"
