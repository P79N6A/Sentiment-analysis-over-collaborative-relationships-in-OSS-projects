    "body": "IIRC, Python's GC doesn't actually 'collect' anything so much as break reference cycles at arbitrary locations and let the `__del__` functions run from there. That said, there's nothing keeping us from completely avoiding reference cycles, because the dependencies are _basically_ acyclic in the C core, with some temporary 'sibling' dependencies according to events (which can thus be tracked by tags).\n\nI don't think we need to make any feature requests against the gRPC C core API to handle this (although we'd need to clarify some lifetime specifics, e.g. whether or not calls are allowed to outlive servers). We'd just need to entirely refactor `grpc._adapter` and especially make more sophisticated our tagging mechanism.\n"
