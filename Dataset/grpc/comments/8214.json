    "body": "Ok I got around this in the end.\n\nIm not sure why after cross compiling protobuf that grpc make decided that it wanted to recompile it.\n\nSo what I ended up doing was natively compiling plugins as suggested (these are required as part of the protobuf build).  \n\nI used the following make line:\nmake V=1 HAS_PKG_CONFIG=false CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc CXX=arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++ RANLIB=arm-linux-gnueabihf-ranlib LD=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc LDXX=arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++ AR=\"arm-linux-gnueabihf-ar rcs\" static\n\nThen I ended up hacking the makefile as follows:\nchanged the protobuf configure to the cross compiled version -\n\n./configure --host=arm-linux-gnueabihf CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc CXX=arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++ --with-protoc=/usr/local/bin/protoc\n\nThis allows protobuf to build.\n\nI also then immediately deleted the native pluggins after the protobuf build so that make would be forced to cross compile them (this is required for libgrpc_plugin_support.a)\n\nI then hacked all further uses of protoc in order that the natively installed protoc was used rather than the cross compiled version.\n\nThis finally got me a full set of static libraries & I have them working on the target.\n\nIt's far from pretty & I'm sure not the recommended solution.  \nBut hey it worked!\n"
