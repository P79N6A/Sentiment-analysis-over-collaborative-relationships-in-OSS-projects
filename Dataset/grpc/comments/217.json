    "body": "I think that for all of the scripting languages, we can say that there is a test runner (the first part of the command to run the test) and a list of test cases to run. Then we could use something like `SimpleHookLanguage(build_script, test_runner, test_case_glob)`. If we want to be completely general, we could say that the test runner for binary tests is `None`.\n\nWe also might be able to turn those build scripts into a list of build steps, though I don't know if that would be better.\n"
