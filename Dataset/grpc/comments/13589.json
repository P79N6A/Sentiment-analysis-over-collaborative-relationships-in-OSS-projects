    "body": "The 1.8.x branch which will be released soon pulls in protobuf 3.5.0. \r\n\r\nHowever, gRPC and protobuf at runtime are mostly independent at runtime. The submodule mainly influences the gRPC protoc plugin that gets built. If you generate your pb2 files with a newer protoc version, you can simply link your app to a newer protobuf runtime library and it should work. Is there a reason that would not be satisfactory for your use case?"
