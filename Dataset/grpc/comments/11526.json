    "body": "So, I'd need more information about what you're trying to achieve, and you're missing the point of the \"Anything else we should know about your project / environment\" question.\r\n\r\nRight now if I run `bazel build :all` on my branch, it works fine. If I run `bazel test test/...` I am getting one broken test, but the rest seems fine too. So that doesn't really fit a \"it's all broken\" status.\r\n\r\nGiven you're trying to run `bazel fetch`, I am guessing you're trying to somehow grab remote modules. But we don't specify any in our `WORKSPACE` file at the moment, so while this may change in the future, running a fetch right now is kind of useless.\r\n\r\nI'm tempted to file this as a case for Dr. Kromkheit, but I'm willing to hear more of your actual usage case that leads you to run a `bazel fetch` on gRPC even though it's not actually necessary to, aside from being future-proof for the potential case we start using remote bazel modules."
