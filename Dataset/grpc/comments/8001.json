I then use `ProtoBuf.loadJson(definitions)`. I load this into grpc by doing `grpc.loadObject(builder.lookup('mynamespace.MyService'))`.\n\nThis works fine for regular protobufs, as well as non-streaming grpc calls. I think the streaming information is lost somewhere in the mix.\n\nThere are a lot of .proto files involved here and I'd rather not have grpc parse them at runtime. Is there a better way to do what I'm doing? Do we need to send PRs to Protobuf.JS?\n"

    "body": "You're right. I totally missed this in my tests, but it looks like Protobuf.js does in fact drop the streaming information when it converts to JSON. The funny thing is that grpc can actually load those JSON files directly with `grpc.load(json_filename, 'json')`, but it just calls `ProtoBuf.loadJson` anyway, so that wouldn't help.\n\nWhy don't you want to load the proto files at runtime? It isn't really much different from loading JSON files at runtime.\n\nAnd yes, this is a bug in Protobuf.js, and it needs to be fixed there. That `pbjs` tool is discarding information, and it should not be doing that.\n"
