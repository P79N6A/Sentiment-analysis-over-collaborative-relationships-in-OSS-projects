Since gRPC is a quick Stubby/ARCWire/Sake integration-rewrite, let's wait until the [developer docs](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/7636) come out, and then we can take our time by carefully going as a community through the reasoning behind the design, analyzing all the data flow possibilities, and propose places where optimizations in implementation might become beneficial as part of the 1.1 release.\n\nHope you don't mind,\n~p\n"

    "body": "@nicolasnoble I agree that, that is a given :)  I assumed the code somewhere is already performing the memory allocation automatically for a `_zval_struct`, as he was just passing the address and the PHP tests were passing in Jenkins.  \n\nIt might be good to have some helper functions, so that things like this don't surprise us in the future.  I proposed to in https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/pull/2137#discussion_r73775688 to create an `Optional` type so that things are easier to manage, and maybe the same can be performed here where `PHP_GRPC_MAKE_STD_ZVAL` is defined to create and allocate at the same time.  Basically the less a developer has at to worry about, the more they can focus on the design - which is already quite complex, when one has to walk through all the intricacies of the code-base.\n"
