    "body": "This may have nothing to do with gRPC. In particular, it is a known\nphenomenon that processors may slow their clocks down if the load is very\nlow, and this may have a negative effect on latency. As load increases a\nlittle bit, latency is likely to actually improve as processors ramp their\nclocks up. However, beyond a certain point, latency will degrade as load\ncontinues to increase. The only way to rule out this effect is to peg your\nclock at the maximum speed.\n\nOn Tue, Sep 6, 2016, 1:41 AM psnbbgy notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> I found a curious result when I test gRPC:\n> I send package(21KB) with client using one thread, and when I send 100000\n> packages without stop, I get the latency 4.4ms, and when I use sleep()\n> function everytime I send a package, I get latency larger than 10ms.
