    "body": "It's not clear to me what it is you were trying to accomplish. Looks like you were trying to use maven to use the gRPC C# tests (which is something that we never tested and is not supported).\r\nIf you are gRPC C# contributor and you need to run gRPC C# tests, please use run_tests.py script to run them (see https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/tools/run_tests). If you are gRPC C# user, you don't need to run those, just use the nuget package.\r\n\r\nIf this is a failure in your unit tests, you need to include a code snippet that triggers the problem, otherwise we can't really do much. \r\n\r\nJust an idea: if you are hitting this assertion https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/a0c7ec851e099a625230b369f5de0f616ca9def7/src/csharp/Grpc.Core/Server.cs#L214, that probably means you are trying to invoke server.ShutdownAsync twice."
