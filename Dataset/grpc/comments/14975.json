Currently all that most of the distribtests do is to install the package and try to create a channel (which verifies that the native library gets loaded correctly - see e.g. https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/d81271f16dfa31274dddcf34e8695f73f616abbe/test/distrib/csharp/DistribTest/Program.cs)\r\n\r\nIdeally we would also like to test the codegen phase and run a simple example (like helloworld) using that generated code.\r\n\r\nThe only difference is C++, which has a distribtests that also does the codegen (both helloworld and routeguide), but C++ is different than other languages as it doesn't really have any packaging system."
