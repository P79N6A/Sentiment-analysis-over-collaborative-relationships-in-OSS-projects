Is there a way to make it accessible from inside the code? What if we moved it into the code itself; could setup.py find it there?\n\nI think the legacy libraries do something smart with not-replicating-the-version-number-thither-and-yon; we may want to follow what they do.\n"

    "body": "First thing that comes to mind is having `setup.py` generate a file at build-time and place it in the package tree (as things are similarly done e.g. in 'configure' steps of lotsa libs). Alternatively, it _should_ be possible for `setup.py` to find files in the package tree (it certainly can find them just about anywhere else). Further, `setuptools` provides facilities for getting the version (but then `grpcio` depends on setuptools post-install...).\n\nI'm weakly against the idea of putting the version number anywhere else but `setup.py`, as that's where the other bits of our metadata go and where most projects seem to put their project metadata.\n"
