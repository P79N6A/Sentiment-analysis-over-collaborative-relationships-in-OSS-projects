    "body": "@nathanielmanistaatgoogle the key/NEW API in PR #12644 is now finalized: both jboeuf and markdroth have said it looks good, pending some internal cosmetic changes, and potentially removing of the current/OLD API.\r\n\r\nsummarizing the new API: one has two options to create server credentials: 1) by specifying a fixed certificate config, or 2) by specifying a certificate config fetch callback that will be called on every new client connection and which should return new certificate config or \"unchanged\".\r\n\r\nspecifically: one creates a `grpc_ssl_server_credentials_options *` by using either:\r\n1. `grpc_ssl_server_credentials_create_options_using_config()`\r\n2. `grpc_ssl_server_credentials_create_options_using_config_fetcher()`\r\n\r\nthen one passes the options object to `grpc_ssl_server_credentials_create_with_options()` and then passes the credentials object to `add_secure_port()` as before.\r\n\r\nsince the fetcher case (2) is key for server cert reload, i'm focusing on it first to get your early feedback. support for (1) can be added after, and also the current API, i.e., continues to work (although there's discussion in PR #12644 about removing it).\r\n\r\nthanks!"
