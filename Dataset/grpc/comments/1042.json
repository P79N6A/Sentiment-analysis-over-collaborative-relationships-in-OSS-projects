    "body": "We chatted with Kenton Varda about it and for the moment he wan't too interested in using GRPC as the wire-transport mechanism for Cap'N'Proto RPC. If someone wants to write a binding over the GRPC transport layer we would welcome it as a contrib.\n\nI don't think it's quite accurate to describe CapNProto as the successor to Protobuf. There's a great deal to like about it as well as other formats like Flatbuffers so it's an area we keep a very close eye on.\n\nClosing as an issue here as it's something probably more suited for discussing on the mailing list.\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/grpc-io\n"
