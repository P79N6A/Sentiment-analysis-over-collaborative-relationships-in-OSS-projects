    "body": "Hi Christian,\r\n\r\nthe easiest way, although not ideal, would be to copy [`gRPC-Core.podspec`](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/gRPC-Core.podspec) into the repository of your app. Then, in your `Podfile`, add the following line:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\npod 'gRPC-Core', :podspec => \".\" # assuming gRPC-Core.podspec is in the same directory as your Podfile\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you have that, Cocoapods will use your local copy of `gRPC-Core.podspec` instead of the one deployed in Cocoapods' repo. You'll be able to substitute the BoringSSL dependency (in [this line of the podspec](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/cb87dd9fef97d1e1fb2559be68188c0792a3ecd8/gRPC-Core.podspec#L184)) for whatever pod of OpenSSL your other libraries use.\r\n\r\nThe downside is you'll have to manually copy `gRPC-Core.podspec` again every time there's a new release. But there are ways to make that easier. E.g. if you add the gRPC GitHub repo as a submodule of your app's repo, you won't have to redo your OpenSSL edit every time you update to a new version of gRPC.\r\n"

I'm not sure it matters.\r\n\r\nQuickly surveying download stats on cocoapods.org [OpenSSL-Universal](https://cocoapods.org/pods/OpenSSL-Universal) is far and away the most popular, followed by [OpenSSL](https://cocoapods.org/pods/OpenSSL). Neither of these have been recently updated.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, switching gRPC's dependency to one of these still wouldn't help someone using Cocos2d-x. There's also a long tail of OpenSSL-related pods in CocoaPods any of which could also conflict. All we can do is make conflict less likely, but making this change isn't going to actually fix the problem.\r\n\r\nThe best path forward (but overwhelmingly the most work) would be to drop our BoringSSL/OpenSSL requirement altogether on iOS and other Apple platforms and use SecureTransport (or CFSocketStream). These are provided by the OS and designed to be compatible across OS releases. If there's a vulnerability, Apple can ship an update and everyone will be transparently updated without requiring everyone to rebuild.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative could be to ship a subspec of gRPC that removes the BoringSSL dependency without necessarily providing an alternative. This is difficult in practice because it requires the end user to configure their project such that gRPC can find OpenSSL/BoringSSL headers. It's worth considering though because it's definitely easier than our current workaround which involves cloning and editing the gRPC podspecs. Of course, to make this work for Firestore users, Firestore would need a similar subspec."

    "body": "Hmm that's right. If `-fvisibility` is only enforced by linker, BoringSSL static library will not be affected.\r\n\r\nThe story is a bit different as I experimented with frameworks. Frameworks are built with linker involved, so `-fvisibility=hidden` indeed forced no-export of BoringSSL functions. But that makes gRPC-Core not finding the BoringSSL symbols since it's a separate framework that depends on BoringSSL."
