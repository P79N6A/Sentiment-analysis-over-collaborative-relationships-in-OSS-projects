    "body": "A few things to be aware of:\n- The gRPC protocol is currently only defined on top of HTTP/2 or a functionally equivalent protocol. gRPC over raw TCP would require a new protocol specification, and getting it to have the same semantics as gRPC over HTTP/2 would probably require reimplementing most of the relevant HTTP/2 functionality anyway.\n- Current gRPC implementations do not establish and tear down a TCP connection for every gRPC call. By default, they use a single persistent connection for all calls from a client to a single server. This is one of the benefits of using HTTP/2.\n- The [grpc_posix.h](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/include/grpc/grpc_posix.h) header currently has support adding file descriptors to servers and creating channels from file descriptors. That functionality is also exposed in the C++ library in [create_channel_posix.h](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/include/grpc%2B%2B/create_channel_posix.h) and [server_posix.h](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/include/grpc%2B%2B/server_posix.h).\n"
