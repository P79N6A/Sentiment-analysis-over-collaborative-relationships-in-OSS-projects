    "body": "This change makes the roots.pem file to be included in the apps that use this library. It makes the library able to create both secured and unsecured connections, based on the scheme provided in the host string (if any). The default is secured connections.\n\nIt also adds 3 passing tests against grpc-test.sandbox.google.com.\n\nThe biggest changes by number of lines are trivial: protobuf messages generated by protoc, and the XCode project file.\n"
