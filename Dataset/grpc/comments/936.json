I still think it'd be awesome if this was an `apt-get`/`yum`/whatever else for the main linux distros, and `brew`/`port` for Mac, and a proper `msi` for Windows.\n\nFor Python (and I assume others) it'd be really nice if the whole install for this was `pip install grpc`. Without that, a library that depends on this now has some underlying dependencies that users have to figure out on their own. This means that `pip install my-library` (depending on gRPC) would fail because the gRPC core package isn't there -- which makes me sad :(\n\nSo in summary:\n- [ ] apt package (`sudo apt-get install grpc`)\n- [ ] yum package (`sudo yum install grpc`)\n- [ ] homebrew package (`sudo brew install grpc`)\n- [ ] macports package (`sudo port install grpc`)\n- [ ] Windows installer (::double click:: a `.msi` file, Next, Next, Install, Done)\n- [ ] PyPI package contains everything needed (`pip install grpc` gives me everything I need)\n\nI totally get that this is a crap-ton of maintenance...

    "body": "After much discussion, we've come to the (tentative) conclusion that the trade-offs associated with packaging GRPC Python via PIP such that everything comes installed in one go is infeasible or undesirable.\n\nIn particular, we hit two issues: one of the quagmire that is OpenSSL, and (to a lesser degree) that of the culture surrounding package management on, in particular, Linux.\n\n## Why is OpenSSL a problem?\n\nFor reasons not entirely clear, there's an aversion to packaging OpenSSL as a binary, and building OpenSSL from source is notoriously complicated to begin with, let alone in the manner appropriate for GRPC. The binary issue stems from discomfort with respect to the U.S.'s stance on cryptography as weapons and thus not things we should inadvertently be responsible for exporting from the country over the network. It's unclear to us developers (we've yet to consult with our lawyer-cats) whether or not this issue propagates to the source code.\n\nWe furthermore have the issue that the version of OpenSSL on which we depend (≥1.0.2a) is not widely available on systems by default.\n\nDespite GRPC core being buildable without SSL support, it's in our interest to make _being secure_ as easy as possible. We don't want to end up in situations e.g. where if the user installed GRPC, got an insecure version, and later wanted to go secure, then the user'd need to jump through hoops to get the secure version.\n\n## Why is packaging a problem?\n\nIn the Linux culture, it's desirable to have distinct packageable items be in distinct packages. Shared objects get their own version numbers, one links to specific libraries and their versions, etc. Under Debian, for example, we'd eventually want some manner of `python-grpc` package to directly depend on an e.g. `libgrpc` package (and a `libgpr` package?) and thus to indirectly depend on OpenSSL ≥1.0.2a. PyPI only supports package dependencies among Python packages (it is, after all, a Python repository). This entails that we cannot (sanely) separate out GRPC Python from GRPC core on PyPI alone, while we can separate them if we assume the user is willing to install GRPC core separately.\n\nPySqlite3, for example, took this approach back before it became part of Python's 'standard' distribution. Unless `sqlite3.c` was somehow provided to the setup script (which may have been the case in a much earlier incarnation of the library, but not so in the latest version), the package would depend on the system install (and presumably fail to build if the system lacked the library).\n\nThen there's OpenSSL...\n\npyOpenSSL employs FFI to communicate with OpenSSL (thus implying its implicit requirement that OpenSSL be installed on the system first). [eGenix](http://www.egenix.com/products/python/pyOpenSSL/) did back-breaking `setup.py` acrobatics with their pyOpenSSL-like package to ensure that OpenSSL would be installed on the system (and that for a version incompatible with GRPC core's requirements).\n\nSo, even if we packaged GRPC core in with GRPC Python, we'd still be in the same boat with ensuring OpenSSL's availability (and that appears to currently require more engineering effort than we are willing to apply).\n\n## What are some potential solutions we're thinking about?\n\n(This section is by no means exhaustive - I'm typing this on an empty stomach and desperately need lunch. :-P )\n\nRemember that GRPC needs to communicate with the binary of OpenSSL. It's conceivable that if eGenix's pyOpenSSL package upgraded from 1.0.1m to 1.0.2a we'd be able to import their Python package and have the linker handle the GRPC core library dependencies at link time (thus allowing us to use OpenSSL). That would allow us to, perhaps, package GRPC core in with GRPC Python on PyPI, and not require any package management outside `pip`. Such is an option we're keeping an eye on.\n\nWe also have the option of dynamically choosing whether or not to use the secure version of GRPC at setup time. We could query the system for OpenSSL, and if it isn't there use `libgrpc_unsecure`. This goes against our desire to make being secure as easy as possible s.t. users who installed GRPC and later installed OpenSSL would need to _reinstall_ GRPC to have security enabled.\n\nThere's a security credentials extension API in the works that could _potentially_ solve this issue by having an OpenSSL module-of-sorts for security. There are some problems with that theoretical future (in particular making it enabled by default wherever possible), but it may be possible.\n\nI'm closing this issue (for now). I'd be happy to have it re-opened it with new information or resources.\n"
