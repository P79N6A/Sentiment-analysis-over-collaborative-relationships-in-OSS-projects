I'm updating the build instructions in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/15178.\r\n\r\nAbout the other failures\r\n- we should probably disable the `auto_set_flakes`  feature in run_tests.py by default.  I might do that in a separate PR.\r\n- the \"Reference assemblies not found\" problem is actually  https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/335 and it's a problem with dotnet SDK itself, not really a gRPC specific issue. We did our best to work around the problem here https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/246071a4e22d3d2ea19dad8714b19ef2dae5464a/src/csharp/Grpc.Core/Common.csproj.include#L23, but that workaround might not work for Arch Linux (I suspect you can fix it by providing the right `FrameworkPathOverride` value for your system)\r\n- the problem with \"First time experience\" of dotnet SDK breaking your build seems to be a problem with dotnet SDK installation for Arch Linux being broken. I don't think it's reasonable to make our build instructions more convoluted to workaround a non-grpc specific problem on a single linux distribution.\r\n\r\nI hope with modifying the workaround for https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/335 you should be able to build successfully."
