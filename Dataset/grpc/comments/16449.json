    "body": "I just today ran into the same issue which has been resolved by making sure that the resulting object files are named unique. If you just run over the proto files and generate the .h/.cc files everything is placed in subdirectories. If you know run over the .cc files, compile everything to object files make sure to also consider the directories the files are in as the filenames are *not* unique over the subdirs.\r\nThis fixed it for me - hope it helps!"

    "body": "Hey @navono - sure. So the problem for me was, that I simply made a loop over all existing proto files, generated the .cc/.h files into one single folder and tried to compile it. \r\nThat alone is already the problem as the names of the proto-files (and therefore the resulting .cc/.h files are *not* unique) resulting in missing files as they overwrite each other.\r\nSo my solution was just to take the whole input directory of the proto files in the loop to generate unique output names for the .cc/.h files. \r\nMeanwhile I figured out that if you just use a for loop over all proto files (simply with a find) and push them all one-by-one through protoc with --cpp-out / --grpc_out pointing to a single directory it automatically uses the relative directory (or maybe the namespaces?) as subdirectories for the generated files.
