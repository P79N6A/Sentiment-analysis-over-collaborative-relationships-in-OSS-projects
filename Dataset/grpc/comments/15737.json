    "body": "Are you suggesting this would then be a Bazel 'visibility' specific issue and not core itself? I have indeed set the default visibility for all my BUILD files (and WORKSPACE) to `public`. So would this then be a matter of listing these files under `srcs` or `deps` in the relevant target's build rules in the core BUILD file (currently at the project root)? If so, I can try and find out which targets these would belong to.\r\n\r\nI'm not much familiar with `core` code, but I initially assumed this could be happening because of the access modifiers or visibility of code for the core targets that I'm using as dependencies."

The difference between the two is that a file that's in the `hdrs` section can be referenced by another target, while a file in the `srcs` section can only be referenced by the library itself.\r\n\r\nIt was the case before that nobody was supposed to use these files outside of the iomgr itself, but that's no longer the case if you wish to make a cython target that uses them."
