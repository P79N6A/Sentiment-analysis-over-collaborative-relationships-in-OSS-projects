    "body": "@ctiller   to answer the question \"can we make this simpler\":\r\nI'm trying to, here's some analysis:\r\nIn terms of prerequisites, we currently have these:\r\n- git, cmake, visual studio - I think those are very reasonable and we can't be really expected to build without them (assuming we are using cmake which IMHO is our best option currently)\r\n- ninja (is optional, you need it if you want faster build or boringssl asm optimizations)\r\n- perl, go, yasm - those actually are all purely boringssl dependencies - so yes, we can get rid of those dependencies if we don't build with boringssl (but in that case you would need to install openssl instead) \r\n- chocolatey - assuming you want to install perl go and yasm, using choco is the easiest ways I know of currently. So if we didn't need to build boringssl, you don't need chocolatey.\r\nSo most of the dependencies are actually required by boringssl, not by grpc code.\r\n\r\nIn terms of build steps, we have these (in case you choose the easier VS-only way)\r\n- recursive git clone (technically not part of the build but it turns out users don't realize you need that, so \r\nit probably makes sense to include it)\r\n- create the directory for building and enter it  `md .build` and `cd .build` - not really a step that has much intellectual overhead and it's good for ensuring users are in the right directory.\r\n- cmake \"generate projects step\" `cmake .. -G \"Visual Studio 14 2015\" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`\r\n- actually build using `cmake --build .`\r\nSo overall, the actual build steps are already quite minimal.\r\n\r\nWhat can be done\r\n- a bit of docs polishing (to make the minimal resistance path more obvious)\r\n- we could add a .bat script that will do some of the steps for you (but frankly, it's 3 commands not counting cd and md after you installed the dependencies, so I don't know if having a script doesn't add more complexity that what it solves).\r\n- we could investigate how to build without boringssl (that's entirely possible, but building with a different security library than we use on linux is not very good for consistency)\r\n"
