    "body": "Thanks for looking at this. The worry here is test latency. Indeed the first run of this reports 6.5 hours for the TSAN run. I don't believe that number however: I think something deeper is going on - individual tests don't seem that much slower. I just ran it again to get some unloaded latency numbers - since I'm not sure anyone else is likely to run tests at 4am.\n\nLet's figure out:\n1. What this really does to build latency\n2. Is that addressable\n\nSo far I've been playing the game of precariously balancing then via the timeout multiplier simply for expediency (and that it mostly worked).\n"
