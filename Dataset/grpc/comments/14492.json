    "body": "As a follow up, I implemented an async service version so I could explicitly control the threading, and while this is working, and performance has improved significantly, perf is still quite bad overall. It seems like regardless of the async service, grpc spawns (arbitrarily) timing threads which I can't seem to control. I have seen some pretty bad cases like:\r\n\r\n4 explicitly spawned threads, 20 implicitly spawned timing threads:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/564042/36852026-0be135ac-1d6b-11e8-9b65-77da7792ccc6.png)\r\n\r\n12 explicitly spawned threads, 37 implicitly spawned timing threads:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/564042/36852630-7d82320a-1d6c-11e8-8f57-1fe2d2ac9212.png)\r\n\r\nIt would be great to know if the timing threads can be either reduced, or disabled somehow, and also what they are used for.\r\n\r\nAny best practices on writing a high performance c++ async server where an RPC can take a long time to return (heavy calculation) would also be great to know.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nGraham"
