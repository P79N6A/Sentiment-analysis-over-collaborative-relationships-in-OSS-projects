The data from those benchmarks can be found here: http://performance-dot-grpc-testing.appspot.com/explore?dashboard=5717648100818944. As you can see, according this benchmark, JSON over HTTP is significantly slower than proto over gRPC, and this difference scales with message size.\r\n\r\nI would not claim that these benchmarks definitively indicate that gRPC is faster that REST, but I no longer believe that we can trust the old benchmark indicating a \"2.5x performance difference\" in the other direction."
