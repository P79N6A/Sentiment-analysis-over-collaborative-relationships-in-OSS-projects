    "body": "Noting too that `Windows Server 2008` also seems to use the same default hosts file config and so also appears to have the same problem. Also c-ares issues https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/issues/100 and https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/issues/85 seem relevant.\r\n\r\nIn order to not require that bumping to a later grpc release requires changing your machine's \"hosts\" file, is seems that something is going to need to at least be able to fake up an \"localhost\" as a special case."
