    "body": "I think this is a result of asynchronous calls getting \"backed up\", so to speak. Since all of the calls are executed simultaneously, we probably have a situation where each call starts, then each call spends a long time waiting on asynchronous callbacks, then each of them finishes. I would be interested to see how this is calculated based on the execution start and end times, rather than the individual start and end times of each call.\n\nPart of the problem is that the current implementation makes **a lot** of asynchronous calls for even a simple unary request. I'm not sure of the exact number, but I think it's at least 10 on each side. I am working on a change right now that should decrease that to 1 or 2, maybe a couple more depending on how you use the event handler interface.\n"
