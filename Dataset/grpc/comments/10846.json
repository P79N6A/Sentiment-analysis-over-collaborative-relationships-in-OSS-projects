    "body": "Current status update:\r\n1. Integration of grpc master with TF is blocked on merger of #10971 \r\n2. There is a viable branch for benchmarking TF at vjpai/tensorflow in the branch [grpc-patch](https://github.com/vjpai/tensorflow/tree/grpc-patch) . This branch is based on tensorflow/tensorflow#7466 and is currently pinned to grpc on the branch associated with #10971 . When the gRPC branch merges, I will update the TF branch to be pinned to grpc-master\r\n3. The true integration of TF master with gRPC master is blocked until gRPC resolves its large message issues on Windows as stated in #10161 and which is being resolved using #10716\r\n4. As soon as possible, we should try to `git bisect` an answer to when the Windows large message tests started breaking. They are fine at the gRPC commit that TF is currently pinned to ( d7ff4ff40071d2b486a052183e3e9f9382afb745 , or #7817 ) but are failing at master. Is this bisectable?  That commit is on the v1.0.x branch; if not, we'll need to start it back to that branch cut point or something."
