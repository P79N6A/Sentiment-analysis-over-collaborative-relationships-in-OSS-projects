Solution now builds.\nWhat I don't know, can't remember at the moment, is what else I did. I recall manually having to put protobuf into the thirdparty directory as per the windows readme. I also remember the step required to get to point I could run the protoc compiler with the grpc plugins being a bit complicated, but I can't remember how now.\n\nSo I _think_ that to get the Visual Studio solution to build, you just remove \"boringssl\" and \"z\". However, just building the Visual Studio solution isn't enough.\n\nBasically there needs to be a one shot script somewhere, equivalent to the unix \"make install\", as currently it's just too error prone.\n"
