    "body": "Hey guys, I might be able to shed some light on this issue! In late June I opened [issue #15889](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/15889) which similarly to this issue involved rpc calls not respecting the set deadlines and blocking for large periods of time. All the information about the bug and it's eventual solution can be found in the now closed issue linked. The result of all this was [proposal A18](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A18-tcp-user-timeout.md). Initially seeing my original reproduction case as non-reproducible with the nightly builds after [PR #16419](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/16419) was merged was great.\r\n\r\nWe have however since uncovered another edge case where by passed rpc call deadlines are not respected which I believe is the exact same issue the OP is experiencing here. What we're currently experiencing is while connectivity is broken (iptables rule is active from the original repro case on [#15889](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/15889)) the rpc calls timeout as expected but if you wait for the first re-connection (approx. `initial_reconnect_backoff`) you will see the _next_ rpc call block in a similar fashion to what's reported by OP. Raising the `initial_reconnect_backoff` directly relates to the amount of time it takes for a blocking call to occur, it's pretty clear to us that this blocking (which is not respecting our timeout) happens when calling an rpc while the channel is attempting to re-connect.\r\n\r\nWhat we've discovered is that, in our case this blocking consistently lasts exactly 127s at which point a DEADLINE_EXCEEDED exception is finally raised. We thought this was quite suspicious and we rather quickly suspected that the max `tcp_syn_retries` set on our sockets might influence this timeout. For context, the default for our version of linux is 6 which according to the [kernel docs](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt) results in a maximum connection timeout of 127s.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntcp_syn_retries - INTEGER\r\n    Number of times initial SYNs for an active TCP connection attempt\r\n    will be retransmitted. Should not be higher than 127. Default value\r\n    is 6, which corresponds to 63seconds till the last retransmission\r\n    with the current initial RTO of 1second. With this the final timeout\r\n    for an active TCP connection attempt will happen after 127seconds.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we re-tested our repro case with varying values for `tcp_syn_retries` from 1 all the way up to 6 by doing something like:\r\n`echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syn_retries`\r\n\r\nLow and behold the deadline on rpc calls while grpc was attempting a reconnect directly correlated to the max expected connection timeout determined by the current value of `tcp_syn_retries`\r\n\r\nsyn_retries | re-connect timeout\r\n----- | -----\r\n1 | 3s\r\n2 | 7s\r\n3 | 15s\r\n4 | 31s\r\n5 | 63s\r\n6 | 127s\r\n\r\nAll of these timings were consistent between multiple iterations of the test.\r\n\r\nOur solution to this was to set the `tcp_syn_retries` to 2 globally on the hosts running the grpc based service in question but we would really prefer to be able to set this as channel option within GRPC. A similar solution to [proposal A18](https://github.com/grpc/proposal/blob/master/A18-tcp-user-timeout.md) would be ideal, because that way you're not forced to set such an important kernel setting system-wide.
