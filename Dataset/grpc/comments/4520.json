    "body": "Under the recommended by the official installation guide MSYS2/mingw environment, it's pretty much impossible to compile grpc. The amount of issues is overwhelming to say the least. You have to edit the makefile, hack multiple defines in headers, manually compile every dependency, manually move the static libraries to the corresponding folders, sort up silly issues such as // comment styles in C files etc. And even after all that, it's still not enough, there are still bugs left to fix because libgrp.dll somehow didn't compile.\n\nOn top of that, there's at least one misleading suggestion printed out by the makefile itself and contained in the installation guide. It's related to OpenSSL. The precompiled binaries available via the link don't include the static libraries (*.a). To my understanding, that's mandatory for grpc to compile(but I might be wrong). Not sure if that's still relevant though since someone recently switched the TLS dependency to BoringSSL.\n"
