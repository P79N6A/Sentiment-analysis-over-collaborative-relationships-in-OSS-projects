    "body": "Major changes relevant to grpc:\r\n\r\n - No constructors anymore for messages, instead there are static `encode` and `decode` functions.\r\n - loadObject and build do not work the same way. We can't do a `loadObject` tree anymore. I looked into writing a compatibility layer for it but implementing all of the encode and decode functions seems like an unnecessary overhead.\r\n - `load` is now async (requires a Promise or Callback)\r\n\r\nI think some redesign decisions might need to be made here to make the switch successfully."
