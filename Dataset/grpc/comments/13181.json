At first connect ssh client asks whether you trust this server with this key fingerprint, you have option to add that server to trusted and subsequent sessions to the server immune to man in the middle attacks. \r\n\r\nOff course TOFU is not fully secure, security issue at first connect is obvious but for many cases, such as restricted local networks with no Internet it is a good trade-off."
