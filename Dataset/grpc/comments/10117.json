I don't see why we would need to have our testing scripts compatible with both python versions (in the long run, I'd like to get rid of these scripts rather than investing more work into them).\r\n\r\n2. the title of this PR doesn't state what's the goal (\"Setup continous tests to make sure run_tests.py is compatible with both python 2 and python 3\"), but rather suggests a technical solution (and it's a bad one unfortunately - we have better ways to setup such tests). So yes, we can definitely setup some tests, but I'd need to see answer to question 1) first."
