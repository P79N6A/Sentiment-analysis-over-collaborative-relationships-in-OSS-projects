    "body": "The update from proto side was only uploaded to PyPI as `3.5.0post1` and not a `3.5.1` protobuf version. We should be fine updating to 3.5.0 on the submodule side at this point as the `3.5.0` compiler generates code that should be suitable to use by `3.5.0post1` on the Python side and free of the hack used in 3.4.0."
