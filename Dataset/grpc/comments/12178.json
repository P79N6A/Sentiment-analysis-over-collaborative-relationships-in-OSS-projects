    "body": "Hi, I know we talked about this but I wanted to revisit this PR and just leave this comment for future reference. The server can't consider its recv_trailing_md complete until it has both received the half-close from the server side and sent its own status. This is because recv_trailing_md is a special op when it gets processed at `post_batch_completion` in `call.c`: it actually gives the final_status of the RPC. At the client side, this is the status code; at the server side, it is just a marker of whether or not this operation was cancelled (which gets propagated back up the API). This particular test is doomed because of a deadlock, then, since the recv_trailing_md can't complete until the next operation after it that has not yet been posted to the CQ. It could be resolved, for example, by posting both to the CQ at the same time.\r\n"
