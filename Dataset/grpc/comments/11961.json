    "body": "> did you test this works with an experimental job?\r\n\r\nYes, it works.\r\n> once we enable interop tests on mac, won't it interfere with the service account key interop test? (I think not, but maybe worth keeping an eye on this).\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure Mac interop tests are only cloud-to-cloud, so this won't affect them for now. If we add cloud-to-prod in the future, I might look into just giving more access rights to the interop service key.\r\n\r\n"
