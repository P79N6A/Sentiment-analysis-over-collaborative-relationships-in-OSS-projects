I think that covers most of what you want on the protos in #5919 except for the histogram overhaul.\n"

    "body": "Ok, this is ready to review. The protos are set according to the changes desired. The C++ workers and driver are now able to use them for the basic rpc types defined previously (unary and streaming-ping-pong). The performance testing scripts (run_performance.sh and qps-sweep.sh) have been adjusted for the new command names. I have attempted to make the Node version work, but am not positive that it does. The other languages package their own protos, so we'll need to update those separately.\n\nReview assigned to @jtattermusch for global view of thins\nInput sought from @louiscryan , @murgatroid99 , @kpayson64 \n\nTODO: As the languages support ClientStreaming, ServerStreaming, and BidiStreaming, we'll update the scripts accordingly. Similarly with the languages supporting the Capabilities RPC. I'll start on the C++ versions of those later this week.\n"
