    "body": "@joaocc I just tried installing on macOS, and it seems like there's a misconception here: `grpc` package is not us at all :-)\r\n\r\nThis gRPC project is served under `grpcio` PyPI package, not `grpc`.  I see `pip install pyhelm` ends up fetching `grpcio` too, but it is depending on a very old version of that (nevertheless that's not where it is failing). It's failing on `grpc` compilation, which is not us (sorry, wrong number!)."
