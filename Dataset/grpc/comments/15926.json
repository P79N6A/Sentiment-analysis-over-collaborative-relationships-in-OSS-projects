Some of these changes were to \"third-party\" depedencies like gRPC; One of the changes I made was exactly this one (since Bazel uses gRPC). So I guess this is a very elaborate way to say: +1 ;-) and if I can help to get this merged let me know!"

Note that our test farm doesn't provide any solaris machines to test with.\" We take our testing responsibility seriously for platforms that we support, and we're pretty firm in the opinion that a non-tested platform (or piece of code) is a non-working platform (or piece of code). I don't have a realistic opinion of how to move forward on this category of issues, but perhaps there's some way where the folks looking for Solaris/AIX/etc support can make this possible? Perhaps by keeping a regularly-patched and tested version in their own repo?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Vagrant image? Cloud VM? KVM? I did some digging but I can find the tests but I can't seem to find how the automated tests for the various platforms (FreeBSD, macOS, etc.) are actually launched / managed. Could you point me in the right direction for those? I could then probably create an Illumos based test environment."

It would be awesome if somebody were to set up automated CI testing on these platforms and let us know about them. Thanks @cartr for your contributions and @siepkes for the detailed explanation of the necessity for this!\r\n"
