    "body": "Deadline exceeded status is (unfortunately) best effort for grpc over http2.\n\nCC: @a11r, @ejona86 \n\nWe track deadlines on both the client and on the server.\nIt can happen that the server deadline fires, and cancels the request using a HTTP2 RST_STREAM frame. Importantly, there's no way to represent deadline exceeded with RST_STREAM (but it's the only tool we have available). \nThe packet can then be received on the client and propagated up _before_ the client cancels its alarm.\n\nThe core library goes to some efforts to mitigate this in common cases, but AFAIK it's an impossible thing to fix completely without resorting to HTTP2 extensions, which we've been hesitant so far to pursue.\n"
