Or are you talking about the directory structure as you propose it in that PR ?\n\nI'd been advised to keep the \"debian\" directory in its own branch, i.e. \"debian/sid\". That way if any Ubuntu-specific modifications are required, they could go in an \"ubuntu\" branch. Similarly, if we have to make changes (and we will) for additional binary packages for experimental, they could live in an \"experimental/sid\" branch.\n\nThese branches could be excluded from any tarball releases, so the packaging metadata isn't in them.\n\nDoes that clarify things?\n"
