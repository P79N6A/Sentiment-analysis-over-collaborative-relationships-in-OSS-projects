What you're suggesting would work, but I think there are better solutions to this. I think this should be done by adding reflection capabilities to enums so that one could easily get the name from the number.\n\nIn any case, [dcodeIO/Protobuf.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/ProtoBuf.js) just became active again, and I have switched the dependency (pending a merge) to the protobufjs npm package. So, I would suggest opening an issue or sending a pull request on that repository.\n"
