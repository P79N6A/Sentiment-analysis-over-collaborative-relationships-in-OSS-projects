    "body": "The service config file is not used to configure server objects. It's used to configure how a client should access a particular service when making requests. On production systems, service configs should be obtained dynamically by a mechanism that has not been finalized yet.\r\n\r\nThe argument to server construction that you're looking at there actually has keys and values defined here: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/include/grpc/impl/codegen/grpc_types.h#L149. One of those arguments is `\"grpc.service_config\"`, which can be used to pass a service config directly as a stringified JSON object. This should only be used for testing/development, and as mentioned, it will only be used on the client."
