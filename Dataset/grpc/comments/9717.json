    "body": "@podsvirov \"If you want to use Find-module Packages, please add support for this new functionality without damaging the existing functionality.\" - isn't it what my change actually does?\r\nFrom documentation at https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/find_package.html:\r\n\"The command has two modes by which it searches for packages: “Module” mode and “Config” mode. Module mode is available when the command is invoked with the above reduced signature. CMake searches for a file called Find<package>.cmake in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH followed by the CMake installation. If the file is found, it is read and processed by CMake. It is responsible for finding the package, checking the version, and producing any needed messages. Many find-modules provide limited or no support for versioning; check the module documentation. **If no module is found and the MODULE option is not given the command proceeds to Config mode.**\"\r\n\r\nSo basically having \"find_package(protobuf CONFIG)\" disables the MODULE mode, while \"find_package(Protobuf)\" tries both. Note that I kept the checks for protobuf::protoc style targets, so there it should also work fine for both modes. Unfortunately I'm not sure how to test it, on the Raspbian distro that I'm using the only way that works is MODULE-mode, that's why I made the change."
