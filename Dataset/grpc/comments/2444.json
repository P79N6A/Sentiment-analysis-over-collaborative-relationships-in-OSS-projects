    "body": "I have done some further investigation here.\n1. As I've stated before, the QPS tests will not build on gcc-4.4 as there are too many dependences on lambdas and other advanced features . This is fixed in PR #2771 \n2. There is a repeated compiler warning about \"dereferencing type-punned pointer\". This is coming from the gflags version installed through yum on Centos6, which is gflags-1.3.7. This problem has long been fixed in gflags (since at least 2010 and gflags 1.4) and we should perhaps force a specific dependence on a gflags version. The problem goes away if you do yum remove gflags and then follow the install instructions in grpc/third_party/gflags .\n3. There is also a build error coming through gtest. This is because the yum on Centos6 installs gtest 1.5 . We depend on at least gtest 1.6 . This can be rebuilt and installed from a source download.\n4. I would recommend not installing protobuf-compiler through yum and instead just getting protobuf through \"git submodule update --init\" as stated in the instructions. That prevents protobuf from causing any further errors. I hope that this is an option for you.\n"
