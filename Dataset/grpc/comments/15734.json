    "body": "> The diff is that the first 5 characters are missing. And I also find that the fifth character is always the integer indicating the remaining length of the payload.\r\n\r\n> Does grpc add some specific custom protocol to the result of serialization protobuf?\r\n\r\nYes, gRPC sends length-prefixed messages: see https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md, specifically the definition for `Length-Prefixed-Message`. The prefix contains a flag indicating if the message is compressed as well as the message length; keep in mind that a gRPC stream can contain multiple messages.\r\n\r\nI'm closing this issue, as there's nothing actionable on the gRPC side here. In the future, our [grpc-io mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/grpc-io) is better suited for these types of questions; feel free to follow up with a new email thread there if you have any additional questions. \r\n\r\n"
