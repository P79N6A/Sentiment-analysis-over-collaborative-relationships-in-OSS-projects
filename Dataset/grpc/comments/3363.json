But if adding your cert to the default file doesn't work, this shouldn't either!\n"

We have the x509 cert from the server when we are in ssl_handshaker_extract_peer but the alpn and npn methods return null. \n\nThe server is using grpc-go I believe, and we have a go based client that is able to connect to it. This is the code they are using:\n\n```\n    creds, err := credentials.NewClientTLSFromFile(\"***certname***.cert\", \"***domain_name***\")\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalf(\"> failed to create transport authenticator: %s\", err)\n    }\n\n    conn, err := grpc.Dial(routerEndpoint, grpc.WithTransportCredentials(creds))\n```\n\nThey just have to set the client TLS certificate and domain, then connect with Dial.\n\nBasically using our old stack the iOS app could connect and work, but the new stack requires TLS and I can no longer connect.\n"
