    "body": "Hi @sipdar and @jclardy, sorry that this issue fell through the cracks.\n\nAs Jason said, this error showed up when the version of `protoc` used to generate the `.pbobjc.h/m` files was older than the latest Protobuf runtime library. The solution to it is to do `brew update` on the grpc and protobuf recipes. For some people, Homebrew has failed to update the recipes, and they've solved it by uninstalling them and reinstalling them with `curl -fsSL https://goo.gl/getgrpc | bash -`.\n\nPlease let me know if you were able to fix it, or if it's still causing you trouble.\nCheers,\nJorge\n"
