ClientInterceptor is asynchronous as well, but it is annoying when you need to do something asynchronous within an interceptor.\n\nNow-a-days there is `CallCredentials`, which is easy to implement independent of whether getting a token is instantaneous (call apply() immediately), asynchronous (call apply() when done), or blocking (schedule on appExecutor, call apply() when done).\n"
