From the stack trace, it looks like there is a call on the client that fails due to a status code-14 (server unavailable).</del>\n\nBut in general, you can use the same stub across multiple calls, and the stub is thread safe as well. And actually, if it's possible to reuse a stub across multiple calls, then doing so should be encouraged. Grpc is designed to be able to multiplex many calls over a single connection, and reusing the stub across multiple calls takes advantage of this - (you should see much better performance by doing so, if it's relevant for your case).\n"

It is mostly filling from an in-memory cache so the very simple requests are responded to extremely quickly.  Since the go server spawns off new goroutines for each request and in some of my cases wouldn't be getting more than 6 at a time (at the most) the notion that the server was 'unavailable' makes no sense at all.  Even making it so the client is completely synchronized and just uses a single client (from different threads but they would block themselves on a single mutex) I still run into it.\nIn many cases, it's getting the error as shown above where it's getting the 14 (nicely buried there. :() as part of just getting the 'return' status of the call.  The call on the server has already run and returned.\nIt's really odd.  If I have Ruby use no threads at all, then it seems fine.

    "body": "Does grpc see much testing under Windows?  Considering the grpc-tools gem is broken out of the gate for Ruby/Windows I'm leaning towards no?  Ruby code is generally pretty portable but I wonder if there's some networking edge case here.  It kind of seems like everything has actually worked but some piece is coming in after the fact and saying hey, wait, am I done(!?) and throwing an exception even though it was already properly cleaned up.  Saying the server is 'unavailable' is AFAICT definitely not right.\n\nI just need an efficient cross-language rpc mechanism for localhost messaging and for my particular use case I just need that basic pipe.   I _really_ just want to focus on the bigger problem at hand which isn't the plumbing.  :\\\nI tried thrift and it worked properly (I had to work around its client not being thread-safe) but it was significantly slower and also had some issues in its go server code.  So I tried grpc, ran into these issues, tried thrift, ran into its server issues, came back to grpc, spun on various tries of client changes (since its thread-safety rules weren't documented) and finally threw my hands up.\nIt may come down to writing a simple server and client to show the problem but project wise I've already spent way more time dealing with something that (I thought) should have been a non-issue than I'd like.  \n\nIf there's a bunch of people successfully using windows ruby clients w/ grpc (to go servers - maybe ruby<->ruby has some slight differences?) then I can try to see what I'm doing wrong but it sure 'seems' like things are kind of broken here somewhere.  \n"

I'd like to try grpc again at some point but it will be a little while before I can get back to it.   Considering the other things I mentioned re. Windows being broken as officially delivered (and it receiving no automated testing), it kind of seems like grpc isn't a good long-term bet for ruby/windows clients even if this issue can be tracked down.  \n"
