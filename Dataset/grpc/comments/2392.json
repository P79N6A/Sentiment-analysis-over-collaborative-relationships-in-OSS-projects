    "body": "The reasoning is simple. We believed that fixing the problem should've been trivial for you or Nathaniel, but wasn't for me or Craig. If we reverted the C-core change instead, it means Craig and others wouldn't have been able to continue working on gRPC until that problem is fixed. However, with disabling Cython, if you were to work over the week-end on the Cython port, you probably could've fixed that problem quite quickly, hence not preventing you to work. So in terms of impact, this was the least impactful solution.\n"
