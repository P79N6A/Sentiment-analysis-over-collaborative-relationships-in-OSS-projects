    "body": "The design sensibilities are a little different for the core API versus any of the wrapped languages though.\n\nFor core we're concerned with exposing a minimal set of abstractions that allow other things to be built up, whereas for wrapped languages we're more concerned with ensuring that no foot shooting occurs.\n\nA possible design would be to make a more extensive credentials API that's used in the insecure core base library - another possible design would be to drop the universal credential abstraction from core and start exposing that only at the wrapped language. If I had the chance to do this project again, I think I'd advocate for the latter.\n\nI want to explain that last sentence a little more:\n\nI tend to think of the core library as more of an assembly language of RPC systems. I don't expect, for instance, that many developers would consider programming against something like the batch API - it's awfully verbose, and doesn't express things in anything close to a natural way. It does however permit relatively trivial composition by wrapped languages to build a diverse set of primitives that developers really do want - in a truly efficient way, and in that way it's been wildly successful, in my view.\n\nIn that manner, I suspect if we'd decided to drop the OO usable auth paradigms from core, and only implement them in wrapped languages, we could have come up with some 'assembly language' that expressed the same things, but in such a fashion that the compiled code was a little more separable. To be clear, I've no such design in mind, but I think there's an alternative there.\n\nThat all said, the current core library design meets all the constraints we've ever come up with, which is a huge virtue that ought not be disregarded.\n"
