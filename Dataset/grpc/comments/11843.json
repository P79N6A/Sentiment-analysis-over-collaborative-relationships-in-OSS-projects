    "body": "Based on your description, it sounds like the problem is just \"cannot invoke sync RPCs from service handler\". You're right that that's currently not allowed (partly because writing such code is against async code best practices) and it boils down to gRPC C# threading model. We're currently considering changing that behavior in #11824, so please track that one for progress.\r\n\r\nThe other part of problem is that you're trying to implement an async name resolver in C# code (inside CallInvoker) which seems like a hack and shall be discussed under #11879.\r\n\r\nIt looks like #11824 and #11879 sufficiently cover this issue, so I'm going to close this."
