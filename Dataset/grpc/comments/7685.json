    "body": "I figured out the issue. I was running `npm install` on CircleCI, then copying `node_modules` into the Docker image. This works great for pure-JS modules, but it doesn't work for modules like `grpc` that compile C code. The environment on CircleCI and inside my Docker image was different, so it crashed.\n\nOne solution would be to run `npm install` inside the Docker image. For various reasons I didn't want to do that. So instead I reinstalled gcloud inside the image. Here's what I added to my `Dockerfile`:\n\n```\nRUN npm uninstall gcloud && npm install gcloud\n```\n"
