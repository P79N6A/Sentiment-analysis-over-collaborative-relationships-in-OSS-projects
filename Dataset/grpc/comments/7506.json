    "body": "There's no currently such hook for validating certs in grpc indeed.\n\nHowever there are a few things you can do modify the TLS root.\n1. Use the `GRPC_DEFAULT_SSL_ROOTS_FILE_PATH` environment variable to point to your root (don't know if this works on iOS).\n2. you can also use `grpc_set_ssl_roots_override_callback` function to serve a root for all ssl connections.\n3. you can of course specify your own custom root when creating ssl credentials.\n\nWe _could_ add a new function like the one that you're proposing but at this point, it looks like we have sufficient flexibility to take care of this particular problem and I would be worried about exposing another function in the API that we will have to support.\n\nMakes sense? \n"

But on IOS i cant access the os certificates.\nRight now we are registering our certificates in GRPC but we would like to test our store version (that wont own this certificate inside the application).\nThat s why a hook would solve all our problems.\nThanks for the answer :)\n"
