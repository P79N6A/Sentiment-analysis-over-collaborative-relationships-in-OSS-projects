    "body": "Hmm... Is it actually good enough to simply use the max of the deadlines?  For example, consider the following situation:  At time=0, we get a call with deadline set to time=5, and we start an LB request with that deadline.  Then, at time=1, we get a call with deadline set to time=6.\n\nIf the LB request is still pending when the second call comes in, it seems wrong for us to cause the LB request to timeout before the second call's deadline (which, of course, we didn't know when we issued the original LB request).  Ideally, if the LB request would complete between time=5 and time=6 (i.e., between the deadlines of the two calls), then we should still be able to use the result for the second call, rather than having it be abandoned early.\n\nThis makes me think that perhaps we should not be trying to propagate the original call's deadline to the LB request, because even if the LB response comes back after the original call has timed out, another call may come along that might be able to use the same data.  Would it make more sense to have the LB deadline be independently configurable?\n"

In order to make progress on other fronts, I'm leaving the current \"infinite deadline\" in place with an updated TODO comment. However, this PR does contain other necessary bugfixes. I've changed its title. Please review for those other points. \n"
