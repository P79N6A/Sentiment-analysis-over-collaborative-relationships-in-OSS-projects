    "body": "Seeing that you invoked this test using `make test`, it looks like the problem is just that (the Makefile invokes that test with a simple `$(BINDIR)/$(CONFIG)/resolve_address_using_ares_resolver_test`, which is incorrect).\r\n\r\nThat test requires a flag to be passed to it: `--resolver=<ares|native>`, and it will definitely crash if that flag is not provided.\r\n\r\nNote that our CI test system doesn't actually use `make test` to run tests - it uses the `run_tests.py` test script and `bazel` to run tests, and these test systems are configured to pass the `--resolver=<ares|native>` flag to the test correctly.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is interesting that we have a `make test` target at all. cc @nicolasnoble - it seems that the `test` Makefile target is unused and also won't work, does it make sense to delete it?\r\n"
