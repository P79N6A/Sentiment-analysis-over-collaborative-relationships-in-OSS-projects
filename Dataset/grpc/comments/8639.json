    "body": "@murgatroid99 \nIt looks promising but may I ask you for a usage model for this?\nAs I understand, the `channel` will have additional keys to expose the endpoint type to other side. What endpoint is planned to use to transmit this information?\nThe gRPC server have to support different clients at the same time. How it should switch endpoint from default (tcp) to user requested?\nI thought the workflow looks like:\n- client: creates alternative endpoint and a channel based on it.\n- client: send handshake request with special endpoint information to the server using default, tcp based gRPC endpoint, connection.\n- server: if server doesn't support alternative endpoint, it reject this connection.\n- server: if server supports this type of endpoint, it send server side alternative endpoint information to the client.\n- server: creates alternative endpoint, change current endpoint (tcp based) to alternative communication way and wait for an events on new file descriptor.\n- client: receive handshake information from the server via default channel (tcp). Change current connection method to alternative.\n- client and server: Do RPC via alternative endpoints\n- Shutdown procedure should destroy alternative endpoints and fallback into default gRPC tcp based endpoints. gRPC finishes the channel shutdown using default procedures.\n\nOne more question if you don't mind.\nWhat is deadline/time shedule for implementation of the proposed changes?\n\n@miked-mellanox FYI\n"

    "body": "Using this API would be a lot simpler than all that. The client and server would each be initialized with compatible endpoints using the channel arguments, then they would communicate using those endpoints. The `\"grpc.tcp.client\"` argument would only be used on the client side, and the `\"grpc.tcp.server_factory\"` argument would only be used on the server side.\n\nWe plan to get this done this quarter, assuming there are no major issues.\n"
