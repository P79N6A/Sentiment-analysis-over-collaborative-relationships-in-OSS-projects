Please ignore the implementations in place right now with regard to the use of Pluck and turning its bool return value to a StreamOpStatus - those are just temporary placeholders to make the tests pass. In the real implementation, we'll be passing in the deadline information to core when we initiate the op, but that isn't in place yet.\n"

Everything else has an unchanged default version that uses a default Options parameter. Since none of the WriteOptions have ever been documented or implemented before this, I don't envision that there are any actual users.\n"
