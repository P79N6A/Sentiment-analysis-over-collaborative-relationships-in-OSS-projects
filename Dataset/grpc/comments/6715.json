    "body": "Is it possible to turn this issue into something actionable?\n\nWhich languages were studied?\nWhat were the warnings?\nWhat hung?\n\nOn Wed, May 25, 2016 at 11:51 AM Vijay Subramani notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Feedback from Andrew Macvean's Veneer Toolkit Usability Study. Looks like\n> a GRPC issue.\n> \n> Arguably the largest usability issues experienced during the session\n> related to the underlying dependency on gRPC. Namely:\n> A number of gRPC API deprecation warnings were output during execution.\n> gRPC was failing to close connections on completion of execution, causing\n> the participant's’ application to ‘hang’ for a number of minutes before\n> timing out.\n> \n> In both cases, participants showed concern about their implementation, and\n> the reliability of the client library.\n> \n> “I see a whole bunch of deprecated packages messages. I would go back to\n> the documentation to see if I have used the right api and packages” -\n> Participant 3\n> \n> “Warnings are scary, slightly uncomfortable. I usually ignore them. It\n> would be nice, if they were not there” - Participant 6\n> \n> /rok987@\n> /andrewmacvean\n> \n> —\n> You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/6715\n"
