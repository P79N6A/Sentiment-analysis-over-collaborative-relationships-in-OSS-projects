    "body": "This is supported in the c-ares DNS resolver, but not in the native DNS resolver.  Currently, the default DNS resolver is still the native resolver, because there are some features still missing from the c-ares DNS resolver (mainly CNAME handling and address sorting).  Once we finish implementing those features, we will make the c-ares DNS resolver the default.\r\n\r\nFor now, if you don't need any of the features that are still missing from the c-ares resolver, you can use it.  You can do this by setting the environment variable `GRPC_DNS_RESOLVER=ares`."
