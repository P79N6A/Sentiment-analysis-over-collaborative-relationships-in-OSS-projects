    "body": "As to the issue, I tried with a clean repo and the `prepare_command` trick did work. I think you should probably not check in your `Podfile.lock`.\r\n\r\nI do agree that this is not an ideal way of doing this. However we do think this fit a lot of people's need. A user may elect to check in their compiled proto if they want to, but using `prepare_command` helps guarantee the sanity (e.g. proto version mismatch issues)."
