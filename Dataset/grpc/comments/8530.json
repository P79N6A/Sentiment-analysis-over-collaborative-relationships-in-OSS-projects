    "body": "What do we gain besides complexity?\n\nOn Wed, Oct 26, 2016, 4:28 PM Michael Lumish notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> When working with code that only runs gRPC with one thread, it would be a\n> nice optimization to take the minimum possible action at all\n> synchronization points. To that end, we would #define most of the sync\n> API to either nothing or simple arithmetic and pointer operations.\n> \n> @nicolasnoble https://github.com/nicolasnoble has suggested the\n> following solution: Leave gpr (functionally) unchanged, add grpc sync\n> functions that are directly #defined to the corresponding gpr sync\n> functions (e.g. #define grpc_mu_init(mu) gpr_mu_init((mu))).\n> \n> @ctiller https://github.com/ctiller (or anyone else) What do you think\n> of this solution?\n> \n> â€”\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/8530, or mute the thread\n> https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AJpudU1hNmsxh2AHncngUwDyv7EcNJoPks5q3-IsgaJpZM4KhyQQ\n> .\n"
