    "body": "Hey. \n\nSo I think this is a place where the spec is slightly ambiguous and more guidance should be provided to implementers.  From that same section\n\n\"Clients  that generate HTTP/2 requests directly SHOULD use the \":authority\"  pseudo-header field instead of the \"Host\" header field.\"\n\nwhich is the case here. What the spec does not say anything about is an intermediary converting from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP2 though my read is that it should conform to the above and MUST convert Host->:authority given that Host is always present in HTTP/1.1\n\nHave you seen any clarification on this from the spec group.\n\nFYI - Nice work on nghttp!\n"

    "body": "My understanding is that \"Client that generate HTTP/2 request directly...\" is meant for endpoint that generates requests for their own (e.g., web browser).   This excludes intermediaries which forward requests on behalf of upstream clients.\nSo web browser is a client that generate HTTP/2 request directly, so it use \":authority\" and can omit host entirely.\nOTOH, intermediaries forward HTTP/1 request with origin-form to HTTP/2 link, MUST omit \":authority\" and use \"host\" header field.\n"
