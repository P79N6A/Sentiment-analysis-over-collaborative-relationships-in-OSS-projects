    "body": "It's necessary because the C library is actually built in parent docker files. In this particular case, the cached dependencies caused the build to fail because it couldn't find the third party JSON library. Of course, if we are running `make clean` here, the previous builds don't make any sense.\n\nI don't know if we can fix make to avoid this problem without the guarantee that cached dependencies will never be a problem.\n"
