    "body": "Indeed it looks like failed <i>name resolution</i> doesn't appear to follow the value of the `wait_for_ready` flag. (name resolution appears to continue to retry queries even though `wait_for_ready` is false).\r\n\r\nI'd note that name resolution failures look like a special case here though - if the channel's target <i>has</i> been resolved and the connection sees `TRANSIENT_FAILURE`, then the `wait_for_ready` flag does appear to be respected and the RPC does appear to fail immediately.\r\n\r\nHow severe is this bug for you?\r\n\r\ncc @ejona86, who might have a better idea of proper behavior in this failed-name-resolution case."

We'd use those anyway in hot paths, so it's not a huge deal for us, but it could cause problems for anyone not using circuit breakers and expecting that fail-fast applies to DNS resolution failures."
