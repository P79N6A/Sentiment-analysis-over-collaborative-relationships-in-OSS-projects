    "body": "From the c-level and ruby backtraces, it looks like this happened in protobuf, when loading a protobuf `.rb` file?\r\n\r\nI can't see any grpc-related `.rb` files in the `loaded features` of the trace, and I don't see `grpc.so` in the process memory map.\r\n\r\nGoing to close as from the trace here I don't think this is grpc-related."
