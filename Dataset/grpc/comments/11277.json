    "body": "We have polished, and hopefully clarified, the backoff behaviour since this question was posed (in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/13121 back in Nov 2017). The [documentation](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/000ec4533d906ae7b9f8163871fcad72e8a4e1ac/doc/connection-backoff.md) was also updated. \r\n\r\nIt should be easy, but admittedly a bit confusing, to explain the behaviour in light of the pseudocode algorithm in the documentation. Let me know if you have any issues doing so. Closing for now, but please reopen if necessary. "
