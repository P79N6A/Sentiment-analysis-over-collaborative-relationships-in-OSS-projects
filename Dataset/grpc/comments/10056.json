    "body": "#10100 will fix the problem, which was due to the use of the `--net=host` flag when running the http2 server docker image along with hard-coding the ports `8080-8085`. If multiple Jenkins jobs were running at the same time, starting the http2 server would silently fail because the ports were already bound. Obfuscating this issue was the occasional instance where docker job <span>#</span>2's http2 server failed to start, but while it's http2 interop tests were running it was able to successfully connect to the http2 server started for docker job <span>#</span>1.\r\n\r\n#10100 passed on Jenkins, but locally it *always* fails the first two C++ http2 interop tests (regardless of which two those are) due to another issue: the http2 server, at start up, is in some weird quasi-state where the C++ client can connect to it and begin the test, but the server is not actually responding with valid Http2 frames (verified via wireshark). I've added a healthcheck of the server that gates running the http2 interop tests, and will try to get this added to the PR by the end of the day."
