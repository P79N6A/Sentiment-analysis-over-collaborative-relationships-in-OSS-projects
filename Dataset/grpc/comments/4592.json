    "body": "tox as dependency is mentioned now: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/python/README.md\n\nBut what's missing is the required version number and that is currently 1.6.1 because tox.ini contains the [\"-rrequirements.txt\"](http://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/example/basic.html#depending-on-requirements-txt) directive. (Unfortunately, Ubuntu Trusty ships with tox 1.6.0.)\n\n@soltanmm told me over Hangouts he plans to replace tox anyway for building Python gRPC and keep it only for running the tests.\n"
