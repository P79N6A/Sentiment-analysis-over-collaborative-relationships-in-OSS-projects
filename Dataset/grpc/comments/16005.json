    "body": "First, `SO_REUSEADDR` is a flag that lets you bind local addresses quicker when they've been freed previously by another process. This isn't about sharing ports across processes, this is about stealing sockets from one process to another basically.\r\n\r\nSecond, the flag you're thinking about, `SO_REUSEPORT`, is a Linux-exclusive thing. There's no Windows equivalent for it unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThird, if I am reading you correctly, you want to listen on the same port as a different application. Listening on the same exact port as a *different* application doesn't make any sense whatsoever. The primary purpose of `SO_REUSEPORT` is to create a cluster of stateless process for a single application, in order to easily parallelize the processing of incoming requests by using the TCP kernel layer as a sort of round robin load balancer across multiple processes. If requests are randomly served by different applications, no application semantic would make sense in form or function."

I want the Server to fail (exception, return value etc.) when trying to listen to addr:port that is already listened by a different process. Are you saying that the way to do it is `SO_REUSEPORT` but it's impossible on Windows? That's not what I understand from this: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/winsock/using-so-reuseaddr-and-so-exclusiveaddruse\r\nThanks and sorry if I'm misunderstanding anything"
