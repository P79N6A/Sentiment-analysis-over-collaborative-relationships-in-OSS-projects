    "body": "I've done a `git bisect` between the tags `v1.14.0` and `v1.15.0` ([full logs here](https://travis-ci.org/mpoullet/grpc/builds)) and found out that the commit 894745dfe39185620cf644508fd6fec8510b22bd is responsible for breaking the build on Ubuntu 14.04. So it's a regression between `protobuf` `v3.5.2` and `v3.6.0`. As it is not an issue with `gRPC` per se I'd close this issue here and start investigating in the [`protobuf`](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) repo instead. @jtattermusch as the commit author maybe do you have any idea that could help me further?"
