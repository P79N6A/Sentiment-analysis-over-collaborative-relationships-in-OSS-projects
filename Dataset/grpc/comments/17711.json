    "body": "We actually do that depending on your build configuration.\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, I think the real issue here is an outdated version of setuptools. It looks like the yum `python-pip` package for centos 7.5 is installing setuptools `0.9.8`. I'm seeing some weird behavior out of this version when instantiating [`distutil.core.Extension`](https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/apiref.html#distutils.core.Extension) objects. After upgrading distutils  with  `pip install --upgrade distutils` from a fresh centos 7.5 instance, the build seems to be working just fine, regardless of whether cython is installed."
