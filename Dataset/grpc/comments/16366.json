    "body": "I'm just getting started with gRPC, Python, and proto3, and I also encountered this problem.  We were planning to leverage https://godoc.org/google.golang.org/grpc/status#Status.Details, and it looks like adding details to an error response is also a problem for gRPC _services_ written in Python.  \r\n\r\nI see that this ticket was accepted as a bug last week.  I don't know how big this bug is, but it would be helpful to understand the timeframe when we might see a fix.  That will help my team decide whether we should assume that we'll have support for Details as we start to build out our gRPC services.\r\n\r\nThanks."

You should be able to leverage the function `trailing_metadata` of your gRPC response object in Python."

    "body": "The automatic `status.proto` conversion from trailing metadata is not part of the gRPC package, as it needs a dependency on `protobuf`. We have plans to provide such utility API as a separate package, which would also consolidate reflection and health checking (https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/15830) so this would be blocked until that is resolved. In the meantime, @etiennebch's great Medium post should be helpful."
