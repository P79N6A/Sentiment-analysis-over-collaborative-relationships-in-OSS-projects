    "body": "I mentioned in the issue why this won't get high priority (questionable value of api fuzzing). I'll also add now that calls to gpr_ref and gpr_unref are actually pretty high on our performance profiles because we have so many things being tracked in the system; as a result, I think I'd prefer not to add a PR that adds an unref that should never even get used if the API is being used correctly. So, I'm going to close this and we can talk offline about how much sense it makes or doesn't make to spend protecting against API misuse. (To further muddy the waters: this is not even \"real\" API - this is just the API that gets used by the language bindings implementers, so we're not even protecting against or fuzzing against API misuse by application developers.)"
