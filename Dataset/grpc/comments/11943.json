I plan to open PRs today to enable it for Macs.\r\n\r\n> It looks like the --auto_set_flakes flag is always ON, even for master builds, which doesn't seem right.\r\n\r\nI think we can just set `--auto_set_flakes` to `False` in master builds. This way, it's still enabled by default for when someone runs tests locally. If that sounds reasonable, I'll update Jenkins/Kokoro master builds.\r\n\r\n> -- it should somehow report which tests were marked as flaky (at least when requested)\r\n\r\nWould prefixing the test name with `(Flaky)` make sense? It'll help for when a flaky test fails all 5 runs, and a developer is trying to figure out if their code is causing the issue."
