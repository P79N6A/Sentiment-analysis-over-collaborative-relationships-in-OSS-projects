Our process crashed due to this all the time and finding this \"too_many_operations\" was a lot of work inclusive changing the grpc code.\r\nAnd knowing that the grpc lib is full of abort() invocations and not knowing when and how these might trigger results in a bad feeling. So why is it full of abort() invocations?"

The normal usage of the API, including flaky network conditions, invalid client requests, or any other external factors, should not trigger any assert."
