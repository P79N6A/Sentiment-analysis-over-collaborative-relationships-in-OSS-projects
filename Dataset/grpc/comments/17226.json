I guess I am a bit confused here by 'to start with'. On mobile platform when you lose connection, it's likely because you lose connectivity, and that was the original issue here: when you lose connectivity and gets it back again, there's that deadlock in TRANSIENT_FAILURE that prevents any further call from succeed."

    "body": "> Wait, could you elaborate this? I guess I am a bit confused here by 'to start with'. On mobile platform when you lose connection, it's likely because you lose connectivity, and that was the original issue here: when you lose connectivity and gets it back again, there's that deadlock in TRANSIENT_FAILURE that prevents any further call from succeed.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly the case that the test in this PR covers: the connectivity state starts in READY, because the network connection is working.  Then the network drops, so we transition to another state.\r\n\r\nWhat I meant about \"to start with\" is that if the network connection is not working when the channel is first created, we won't get into this state to start with, because then we will go into TRANSIENT_FAILURE due to the resolver failure."
