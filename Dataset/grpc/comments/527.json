Generally only \"important\" tests and server features required for those tests are likely to be useful. For all the changes to the document that I have reviewed, I have pushed very hard to prevent any need for guessing.\n\nIn your particular case, look at the \"UnaryCall\" feature for the server: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/interop-test-descriptions.md#unarycall\n"

I had also presented about its existence at multiple of our team meetings. Before that document, there was no \"large_unary\" or any other interop test. I also consistently got links to it added to other docs that were made that mentioned the test cases (e.g., the test matrix checklist had a link since October, and it that document was being shown every week in a meeting).\n\nI did everything in my power and believe no corners were cut, but unfortunately you didn't get the information. I fully agree that it was unfortunate, but took offense to your view of the situation exactly because of how well exposed and well defined it was. I chalk it up to \"it happens.\"\n"
