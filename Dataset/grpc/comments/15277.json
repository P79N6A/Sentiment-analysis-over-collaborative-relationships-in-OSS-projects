For 1) in your first post, I tried to build the pod `gRPC-Core` as framework (with the HelloWorld example in `example/objective-c/helloworld`) and I found no private header in the generated framework ([screenshot](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ssXyNsEnfNP1OvcNbaaroFaR_BOBcyAL)). For 2), I was a bit confused about what is `A` and what is `Versions` directory. I do not see a `Versions` directory in the framework or any directory called `A`. Do you have any sample project that has that code signature failure?"

    "body": "You are right. When I build it as macos framework, I do see the private headers in the framework. I agree that it will be good to remove private headers from the framework, but if that breaks something I am fine with leaving them too.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand I am more worried about the second issue. I tried that myself but I was not able to reproduce (maybe I messed up signing since I haven't done that on mac projects...). I would really like to avoid duplicating the pod into static/dynamic. Is there any reason Cocoapods copies the `src` directory to the framework? If only directory `A` is supposed to be there, that sounds like a bug to be."
