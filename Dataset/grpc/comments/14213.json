    "body": "@Horusiath  we actually used to generate interfaces, but deliberately changed to abstract classes, because interfaces aren't backward compatible when new methods are added - and that's one of the most common changes we anticipate with .proto service definitions (the problem with interfaces is that they don't allow providing default implementation, so regenerating a .proto file with new service methods added will result in breaking the build - as the user-written implementations don't implement the new methods).\r\nThe change from interfaces has been done here: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/5928 (and there are links to the original issue).\r\nClosing this issue as \"working is intended\"."
