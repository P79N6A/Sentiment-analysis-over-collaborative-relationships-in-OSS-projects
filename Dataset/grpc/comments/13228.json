They used to recommend piping content from the web directly into the php executable, but have since moved away from that. It would be more secure for us to link to Composer's self-maintained installation instructions where they use php to download and installation scripts and to verify checksums.\r\n\r\nIn this request I am also suggesting the use of Composer to install PHPUnit because it is a cross-platform package manager for php code. There is no security concern from me in a system install via apt-get or any other OS package manager."
