    "body": "This is probably due to the \"grpc.max_message_length\" channel arg not being changed from its default. Tried c++ client and c# client to c# server, with default message lengths (appeared be about 4mb), and did get that same error on all calls.\n\nThis should be able to be fixed by setting the max message length on all of the client channels and grpc servers dealing with those larger messages.\n\nExact code varies, but for C# server, for example, it can be done like:\n\n```\nServer server = new Server(new List<ChannelOption>{ new ChannelOption(ChannelOptions.MaxMessageLength, 8388608) })\n...\n```\n\nIt looks like the exact default max message length varies per grpc implementation. There's more dicussion on this unclearness surrounding the max message lengths of client and server channels in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/7927.\n\nFor the error, assuming this is due to a max message length too small I think that InvalidOperationException still makes sense, but perhaps the message could be adjusted somehow.\n"
