    "body": "After testing, it seems like git fetch isn't necessary. The issue is that I needed to append  --filter_pr_tests --base_branch origin/$ghprbTargetBranch to the built tests script. Before, I didn't have 'origin/'. I can't think of a situation where hardcoding origin can go wrong, but I think once this is being tested, any potential issue should surface quickly.\n\nI also wanted to be sure of something - when someone makes a pull request, does Jenkins merge the pull request's changes into an up-to-date repo, so that the --filter_pr_tests argument will be available to use even if the pull request hasn't rebased for over a week?\n"
