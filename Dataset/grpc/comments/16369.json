    "body": "On debugging, it looks like this happens for batches that do not contain send ops. \r\n\r\nAfter #15782, we do not have an on_complete callback for recv ops, and hence we do not wait on it. There was a hack in the chttp2 layer which added a dummy closure when on_complete was not present, so that things could continue as before. Since, the surface layer is not expecting waiting for on_complete to complete, it considers the batch as complete, as soon as the closures for the recv ops complete. When the batch is marked as complete, new batches can reuse the batch_control data used by the previous batch.\r\n\r\nThe data race occurs when the dummy on_complete closure has not yet finished but we are still considering the batch as complete and try to reuse the batch control. (The dummy closure uses storage from the batch control.)"
