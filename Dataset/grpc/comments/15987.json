    "body": "I don't understand the issue here: `grpcio-tools` of version X requires `grpcio` of *at least* version X, but can work with higher versions of gRPC library as well, which is declared in the requirements. If you need to pin `grpcio` to a certain version, then why wouldn't you want to pin it directly? Also, if I may ask what the motivation is to pin `grpcio-tools` to an older version? "

    "body": "Okay, I found my issue buried in a Makefile.  There's a line here, `pip install 'grpcio-tools==1.12.0'`, which does exactly what I said, you get grpcio-tools 1.12.0 and grpcio-1.13.0.  Later in the makefile, a `setup.py install` was called and it doesn't do a downgrade, so the tests fail down the line.  I guess it helps to be specific.\r\n\r\nNow if `setup_requires` would actually work in a useful way..... oh well.\r\n\r\nSorry about that, disregard."
