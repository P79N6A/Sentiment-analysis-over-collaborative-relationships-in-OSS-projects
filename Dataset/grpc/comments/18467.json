    "body": "@kkm000  In this PR I'm trying to setup automated tests for the Grpc.Tools msbuild integration logic (by extending our C# distribtests which test the nuget packages we build), but it seems that I'm having a problem when Grpc.Tools is being used on Linux and Mac in a test for \"classic\" .csproj\r\n\r\nFor some reason, I'm getting this error:\r\n```\r\n/Volumes/BuildData/tmpfs/src/github/grpc/workspace_csharp_macos_x86/test/distrib/csharp/DistribTest.sln (default targets) ->\r\n(Build target) ->\r\n\r\n\t/Volumes/BuildData/tmpfs/src/github/grpc/workspace_csharp_macos_x86/test/distrib/csharp/DistribTest/DistribTest.csproj: error : /Volumes/BuildData/tmpfs/src/github/grpc/workspace_csharp_macos_x86/test/distrib/csharp/DistribTest/DistribTest.csproj: Invalid type 'ystem.IO.Path' used in static method invocation\r\n\r\n\t 1 Warning(s)\r\n\t 1 Error(s)\r\n\r\nTime Elapsed 00:00:00.2346210\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny ideas what could be wrong?

    "body": "No, looks totally mysterious! So this is mono, right? Does this reproduce on Linux+mono, too? I can try to repro. Do you know the mono version?\r\n\r\nThere is only one place where System.IO.Path is referenced is [Google.Protobuf.Tools.props:11 and 12](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/csharp/Grpc.Tools/build/_protobuf/Google.Protobuf.Tools.props#L11). Probably start from there.\r\n\r\nI would try `msbuild /pp:output.xml` in the test environment and grab that file. This is essentially a composed single huge XML file as seen by msbuild after all files are composed into a project. Maybe this is a real typo but somewhere else, even in another package, and they have a conditional path for mono? Then our reference would be a red herring."

From the command-line you choose between them by running either the \"xbuild\" or \"msbuild\" command. In Xamarin Studio, you can opt in to using MSBuild in Preferences.
