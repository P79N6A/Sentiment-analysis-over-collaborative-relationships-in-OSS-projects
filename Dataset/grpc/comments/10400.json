    "body": "Possible reasons:\r\n-- the processes are leftovers from previously running tests. You need to doublecheck that the test suites don't leave running processes behind (e.g. when a test fails).\r\n-- run_tests_matrix.py  actually runs more test suites at once (and that is the intended behavior even though it can be set to run one test at a time).\r\n-- run_tests.py  suites may also run more test cases at a time (depends on language specific settings).\r\n\r\nIn general, assuming that tests have exclusivity when running is wrong - and I am not sure what gave you the idea that you can rely on that. Also, it should be possible to run the tests in a way that parallel test runs don't collide with each other (in all other languages it works so I don't see why objc should be different).\r\n\r\nThere might be reasons why exclusivity is needed when running objc tests, but let's try not to rely on that.  Let's sync up on what are the assumptions when running objc tests (@matt-kwong, @jtattermusch @nicolasnoble are the right people you can talk to)."

I am suspecting this is that `run_tests_objc_macos_dbg_native` and `run_tests_objc_macos_opt_native` use the same output directory. When they run concurrently without Docker they could be overwritting each other. We might be able to separate them though... looking for a solution."
