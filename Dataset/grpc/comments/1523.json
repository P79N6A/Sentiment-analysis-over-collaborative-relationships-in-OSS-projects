    "body": "@vjpai context: this change makes it possible to build binaries from net/grpc, the way we need to for the qps_{worker,driver}. Previously, those were in third_party/Makefile as cc_binary, which prevented referring to them from //net/grpc as cc_binary again. This change does:\n\n1) Makes binaries such as qps_{worker,driver} \"tool\" as opposed to \"test\" (which they are not).\n2) Makes such \"tool\" targets be cc_library in lieu of cc_binary, in order to be able to build them from //net/grpc (cc_binary which has the cc_library from third_party as dep).\n"
