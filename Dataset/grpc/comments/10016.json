    "body": "+1. I need to be able to manually run the tests, and it doesn't seem readily possible to do that.\r\n\r\nI think the \"build\" and \"run\" should be split though. Rebuilding before each run is maddening.\r\n\r\nCould we have the Dockerfiles specify an `ENTRYPOINT` so that we could simply use `docker run` to execute them? Any arguments would be passed directly to the language's interop test binary, so we could specify which tests and similar. The \"run\" script would then be pretty trivial, and it would allow testing across versions."

    "body": "@ejona86 I feel your pain,  but it's much more complicated than that (because run_interop_tests.py is pretty complex now and there are reasons why things are done in a certain way, it's not so straigthforward to do what you are suggesting - even though it sounds it shouldn't be hard). I tried to do my best and came up with something that should hopefully cover your needs in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/10037 (and at the same time it should be usable for interop testing against older releases).\r\nAlso, I ran out time I can spend on this, so this will have to do."
