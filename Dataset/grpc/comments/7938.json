    "body": "I ran into the same error when creating a Proof-of-Concept gRPC application to see if gRPC would work for my use case. Basically I was trying to send 3 million simple messages from the server to the client, in a single stream, and as a result I get the OutOfDirectMemoryError. I am probably doing something wrong or gRPC was not meant for such use case. If anyone could help, that'd be great.\n\nThe code: https://github.com/lploom/grpc-OutOfDirectMemoryError\n"

    "body": "I get one work around for this issue. reduce the times the rpc server send data to the client. Suppose you want to send 3 million records to client, you could reduce the time by create another message which hold \"repeated\" records of the send message. I do that by adding 10000 records to the new message and then do the sends. The error disappears.\nI think gRpc doesn't work well with millions records stream but by this way I could get it fixed.\n"
