    "body": "Section about protoc on https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/INSTALL.md states that it will detect existing protobuf\r\n\"and it detects that you don't already have it installed\"\r\n\r\n[EDIT]\r\nSo I uninstantiated my protoc version and cloned grpc again and pulled submodules\r\nThis time check install worked fine. I did try to build cpp/helloworld but got issue with older protoc version installed with apt-get (part of ROs.org). But for some reason grpc version was not copied this time !!!!"
