    "body": "I took a look. The current bazel rule is outdated and does not make sense. It just runs a server. The actual test is bad_ssl_cert_test which does not have a rule, and adding a rule for that does not seem possible without changing the test.\r\n\r\nThe way this test is written, they start a server as a separate process, and then run the test. For this to work as a test, we would need the ability to add a binary (for the server) as a dependency to the test. But, that is not allowed from what I read in the bazel rules.\r\nSo, the options I see are -\r\n1) Rewrite the test so that it works with bazel\r\n2) Simply not covering this test with bazel\r\n\r\nAdding @nicolasnoble"
