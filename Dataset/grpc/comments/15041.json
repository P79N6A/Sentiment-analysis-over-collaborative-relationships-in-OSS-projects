This fix only handles the kind of racy condition where we lose connection when a ping is already in progess. In the normal case, where no other ping is in flight, it would send a ping and start the keepalive watchdog timer.\r\n\r\nWe are also conforming to the keepalive timer values in the normal case. As for the case that we are fixing, it does mean that the ping has more time to complete since it was started earlier but it does not harm the spirit of the keepalive ping.\r\n\r\nAlso, when I said that the keepalive timer is not reset based on reads or writes, I did not mean that it is not rearmed when it fires or is cancelled. The keepalive timer is rearmed once the keepalive ping finishes and it is also fired if it is cancelled for some reason."
