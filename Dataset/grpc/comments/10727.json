There is no standardization. Everyone is keen on inventing 1. their own variable names (`PREFIX` vs. `prefix`), 2. funny installation paths / not heeding the FHS split between \"bin\" and \"share\" and just dumping everything into one directory, 3. mess up with the _basic_ expectations we usually get from build systems like autotools, cmake, (or whatever else there is). Like lacking a `make install` target, or, in case of grpc, I just found that it does not care about DESTDIR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[   30s] + make install DESTDIR=/home/abuild/rpmbuild/BUILDROOT/grpc-1.9.0-0.x86_64\r\n[   33s] [INSTALL] Installing public C headers\r\n[   33s] install: cannot create directory '/usr/local/include/grpc': Permission denied\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo no. Whenever there is a build system file, distros will try to use it. We will even write one ourselves if plain makefilery is just way too bulky/complicated/faulty."

Use CMake for all builds on Windows, Linux and macOS.  Always install the `*.pc` files (even on Windows, some folks use pkgconfig and Makefiles there too), and always install the `*.cmake` files.  You cut one build system to support (yes, I know you use templates to generate them, but still...), and your users get to use the build system that they wanted to.\r\n "

You presume your pathing for libraries, etc. is from the same as the tools...which breaks all to HELL on a Yocto setup for follow-on binaries or an SDK sandbox- because your tools are in an X86 environment usually, and the other's in an ARM, MIPS, or RISC-V target sysroot...)  \r\n\r\nIf you did  both, I'd have had the ability to simply resort to pkgconfig configuration which would've honored my target sysroot in the follow on projects.
