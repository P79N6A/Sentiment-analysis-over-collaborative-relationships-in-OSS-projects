I mentioned our use case over on https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/7945#issuecomment-415751801, but to recap, our interest is for caching, but also for HTTP/2 server push.\r\n\r\nFor the caching, we've heard Akamai is going to support server-side HTTP/2 soonish, and the caching certainly interests us. But we write our own clients, so we can do client-side caching immediately.\r\nHowever the main benefit we're looking into is HTTP/2 server-push. We want to do things like have a gRPC response contain a list of object IDs, but not the objects themselves. The response would instead go back with server-pushes or HTTP/2 `Link` headers (which could be converted server-pushes by an intermediary proxy) to the objects. These other objects need to be fetched via gRPC though, so the URL (both as the cache key, and as the Link addresss) has to be able to be translated to a gRPC request.\r\n\r\nSo if the implementation supports these use cases, then we would pursue this, and it would likely benefit us."

    "body": "@phemmer, the protocol was basically to include the message as base64 in the query parameters (`/package.Service/Method?grpc-payload-bin=DeAdBeEf`). So it would be compatible with server push.\r\n\r\nHowever, our clients and servers don't generally support server-push. If your proxy supports a magic header in the response (e.g., `Link`) to generate a server-push, then that would work \"on server side.\" The Cronet transport in Java and ObjC does support server push client-side.\r\n\r\nYou bringing up Akamai-side caching is great though. Because that is an environment lots of people could benefit from."
