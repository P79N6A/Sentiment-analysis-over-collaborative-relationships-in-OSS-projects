    "body": "The main intent of the subchannel index is actually to share subchannels across channels.  In other words, if you have two channels whose name resolutions both include a given address, the subchannel for that address should be shared between the two channels, as long as all of the subchannel's channel args are the same.  (The security connector is a channel arg, so if the two channels have different credentials, the subchannel should not be shared.)\r\n\r\nIn practice, this mechanism is also used in a few other places to check the identify of a subchannel.  For example, the place where I noticed this problem is in the pick_first update code, where we get an updated list of addresses from the resolver and we need to check whether the address that we were previously using is still present in the new list.  Currently, due to the fact that the security connectors always compare non-equal, the pick_first code always winds up thinking that the original subchannel is not present in the new list, even when it is, which causes us to unnecessarily reconnect to the server.  This PR fixes that problem.\r\n\r\nNote that historically, our code has always shared subchannels between channels; it has only been broken since #9194.  This PR simply restores the original behavior."
