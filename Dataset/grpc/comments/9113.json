    "body": "@tbillington I can live with the new-connection per request for now. I need the fast development cycles that gRPC gives me. Could you give me a hint of howto support gRPC on http1.1 appengine... I tought about creating a fake HTTP2 request from an HTTP1 request and then call ServeHTTP on the grpc server. But i dont know where to start.\r\n\r\nNote: I do understand this this issue, is not really a gRPC issue, but more an appengine issue.\r\nHowever support HTTP1.1 for gRPC would be usefull it hink. And it theory its not that difficult for the non-streaming API."
