    "body": "At this moment, s390x is an unsupported platform. However, this issue seems to be from the `setup.py` pulling in a boringssl dependency. Assuming that there is a system openssl in place, you might be able to patch `setup.py` to use that.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to actually have setup.py support the option of using the system openssl if preferred. The `Makefile` in core already supports this (ie, it tries to use the system openssl if available), but in this case, we would want this to be an option. We would be happy to accept patches that enables this functionality.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!"

    "body": "That one's going to be a bummer. While the Makefile is able to detect if you have a system OpenSSL that works properly and will try to use it, the python build system isn't going for this and will always try to use the embedded SSL provided, as @hsaliak mentioned."
