    "body": "Hello, this still seems to be a problem with gRPC 1.6.4 (now available through `gem`). It is **no longer related to boringssl** though, but rather to zlib.\r\n\r\nLog excerpt from OP actually show the errors: warnings about the possibility of fall through in switch-case statements, which are treated as errors.\r\n\r\nI couldn't manage to find anything related, maybe you have a solution?\r\n\r\nI don't know exactly how everything is linked (ultimately, I'm trying to install GitLab on my RasPi3, so I'm far from being the direct user of gRPC), but why is the zlib statically compiled alongside the gem while the PHP extension explicitly [asks for a separate installation](https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/php.html#install-on-linux)?"

    "body": "I didn't follow the development of grpc, but there was also a general fix for gcc 7.x missing, which I didn't noticed in this bugreport, as this was already reported in #12022 (and others).\r\n\r\nAs GitLab 10.0 is still using 1.4.5, and this issue still occurred there, I compiled it manually by adding `-Wno-error=stringop-overflow -Wno-error=implicit-fallthrough` to the `Makefile`.\r\n\r\nBut you're right, `boringssl` got updated with 1.6.0 and this issue is gone.\r\n\r\nGitLab 10.1 will actually use v1.6.0 (at least it's in [master](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/aaa57c9d35b1eb744fca970263220850db06639f/Gemfile.lock#L354)). I gave `gem install grpc -v 'v1.6.0'` a shot and ended with the same issue as you reported - same with `v1.6.4`, `v1.6.5` isn't yet available through `gem install`.\r\n\r\nA new issue should get created for this, as 1.6.0 fixed this issue, I gonna close this issue now :)."
