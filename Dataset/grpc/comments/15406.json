    "body": "This was intentional and documented in release notes: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/releases/tag/v1.12.0\r\n\r\nI apologize for the inconvenience it may have caused, but as a matter of correctness, one should list all their dependencies of their packages directly, and not rely on transitive dependencies to pull it for them. The fact that `grpcio` used to depend on `protobuf` had always been just an implementation detail of `grpcio` and not something our users should have ever assumed from their application or relied on.\r\n\r\nThere are valid use cases for `grpcio` package without pulling the `protobuf` dependency and we wanted to free the users from having to pull both packages when all they need is `grpcio`. That's why the change is made. (`grpcio-reflection` and `grpcio-health-checking` packages still do depend and use `protobuf` since they directly use it)\r\n\r\nFinally, if you have CI infrastructure set up, please please consider integrating and continuously testing with the latest **release candidate** package on PyPI frequently, which we ship usually a week or two before the final release, to help us catch problems early, and to prevent issues on your side as well.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
