    "body": "This is an interesting approach. Generally, when we want to run a tool, writing an MSBuild Task for that is the simplest way to go, as there are APIs to run a process, check files and so on. You write code at a higher level in general.\n\nI will be really happy to contribute and/or guide @ananthonline on that (we adopted gRPC from early alpha straight into production). But it seems to me that a very if not the most important problem here is still not satisfactory solved, namely: If I compile x.proto, y.proto and z.proto, what .cs files will be generated? If I guess wrong, I either cause the project to be recompiled because of missing outputs, or have stale outputs added to compile There is a lot of corner cases, e. g., what happens if I remove the `rpc` declaration from x,proto and recompile? That's the main thing here to get the build correct, or at the very least as correct as practical for most cases.\n"

Again, this seems to become more complicated than it originally seemed to be.\nBecause there seems to be lots of problems to solve, I don't think it is likely that we will be able to address everything in a single PR. Can we instead come up with some minimalist set of features that could be checked-in soon and would provide gRPC users some extra comfort when working with .proto files?\n\nBtw, I am not sure if it makes sense to invest a lot of effort into writing a custom msbuild task in times where DNX-style project.json projects are becoming the standard for new projects quickly.\n\nAlso, has anyone thought of looking at the problem from a different perspective and coming up with a VS extension that would provide some nice integration for working with .proto files?\n"

    "body": "@jtattermusch: I was thinking about an extension. There is one (https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/4bc0f38c-b058-4e05-ae38-155e053c19c5, https://github.com/mreu/ProtobufLanguageService). I did not want it at the time because it looked like it did too much. I certainly want syntax highlighting and other support from the editor, and it promises to be really amazing, look at the sample screenshot! It appears, however, that it also generates C# code, and I certainly did not want another compiler in the picture when everything was still in alpha and unraveling... Anyhow, the page now says \"C# code generation will follow in Version 2.0\" -- I do not remember if the promise was there, but I think I am not the only one complaining! :)\n\nGenerally, a VS extension is a greater hurdle to maintain for users and I believe gRPC or protobuf should [edit] not rely on an extension for the whole rig to work. MSBuild is more than enough to have everything built properly. This seems to be true for mono/Xamarin too, but I am not so well versed in DNX project.json builds, however. An extension, on the other hand, would add all the bells and whistles to user experience, including syntax highlighting, syntactic features in editing, creating and adding proto files to projects, but should not go beyond that, IMO. Visual Studio did include some code-behind code generators, but my feeling is this is not where they are going now.\n\nI'll try to wrap my head around the project.json thing. Long overdue, it's been out for a while and I do not even know much beyond the fact it exists!\n\nAs for writing and debugging an MSBuild task, this is not hard technically, but needs logistics coordination between protoc and gRPC packages.\n"

From my understanding of project.json,\n 1) DNX does use MsBuild behind the scenes\n 2) But we cannot rely on that, and\n 3) If we start off (2), it looks like it's dead uncustomizable. And you are totally right about it being a moving target.\n\nWhat if we just get MsBuild support in place first?\n\nAnd there is also C++, which should be supported in a slightly different way than C#. And of course there is no _documented_ way for an msbuild .prop/.target file to figure out to what language type project it is being added. The more I am looking into that, the more depressing it gets. Oh well...\n\n> per-project nugets\n\nI am not sure about other IDEs, but VS makes little if any differentiation between per-project and per-solution packages. The tool-only packages are not added to project references, but that's about it. I think there was more differences in the times of VS 2012--it used to maintain a file `.nuget/packages.config` for solution level packages, but that's been long gone, AFAIK.\n"

The C# wrapper parses the output of this file (for each input proto) and recursively generates C# down to the leaves of the dependency tree. I've verified that this list does indeed work for both XXYYGrpc.cs and XXYYcs files, along with included proto files that are not even included in the project.\n\nSee build output from an example here: http://pastebin.com/ruvwM8Df\n\nI've also added a proper clean target that cleans up all generated and temporary files.\n\nMight I suggest we support MSBuild + C# projects and then add support for JSON projects as customizability is added?\n"
