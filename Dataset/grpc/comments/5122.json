    "body": "I don't think that's correct for the `CallOptions.With*` methods. The implementation first assigns the current instance to a local variable, which performs a shallow copy since `CallOptions` is a struct. Modifying property on the newly created struct won't affect the original instance (this [test ](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/aa1ebffb323e012167d080c8375097e1bd290fc4/src/csharp/Grpc.Core.Tests/CallOptionsTest.cs#L49)verifies it).\n\n#5073 adds some additional fluent methods that allow to set properties that were probably added after the first with\\* method implementation.\n"
