    "body": "That first command just doesn't use the plugin at all. You don't need it to generate the `*pb.js` file.\n\nThe error message you're seeing is ambiguous. It means that it can't execute the program that you named `protoc-gen-grpc` by writing `protoc-gen-grpc=grpc_node_plugin`. The issue is that you have to pass it the full path to the plugin, even if it's in your `PATH`. So, assuming that it is in your path, you can run the command like this:\n\n``` sh\nprotoc --js_out=import_style=commonjs,binary:. --grpc_out=. --plugin=protoc-gen-grpc=$(which grpc_node_plugin) hello.proto\n```\n"
