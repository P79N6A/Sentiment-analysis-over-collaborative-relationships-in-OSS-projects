    "body": "Hi, I'm having this issue on OS X El Capitan. Anybody had any success?\n\nI tried reinstalling openssl through homebrew and it gave me a message about how Apple is ditching OpenSSL in favor of their own implementation. It said when compiling, I would have to add in some flags myself. The environment variables are:\n\n```\nLDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib\nCPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include\n```\n\nI'm currently trying to edit the bindings.gyp file to pass in these variables, and then rebuilding grpc from source by doing:\n\n```\n# from node_modules/grpc\nnpm install --build-from-source\n```\n\nI'm not very experienced with node-gyp. As a result I haven't had much luck. \n\n**EDIT:** I don't think the above flags are relevant. I ran `brew link openssl --force`. However, still no luck. Also, I followed the \"npm\" instructions [here](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules/#using-npm). I'm now rebuilding grpc using the last time in those instructions with `--build-from-source`.\n\n**EDIT (again):** I got it working. I added the following condition to `'target_defaults'` in `binding.gyp`.\n\n```\n['OS == \"mac\"', {\n  'libraries': [\n    \"/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libcrypto.a\"\n  ],\n}]\n```\n\nI don't really know how to make this into something cleaner, but I'm willing to work with someone on a pull request.  😄\n"

    "body": "I'm working on this, but it's tricky, The fundamental problem is that when building for Node under Linux and Mac, we need to use the OpenSSL that's built into Node because the Node headers include the OpenSSL headers, but when building for Electron, we need to use BoringSSL because Electron doesn't export those symbols. Unfortunately, there's no way to check in the gyp file whether you're building for Electron. I filed electron/electron#6556 to change that.\n\nSo, as this issue demonstrates, it's easy enough to compile this library for Electron; the hard part is determining when to choose those compilation options.\n"
