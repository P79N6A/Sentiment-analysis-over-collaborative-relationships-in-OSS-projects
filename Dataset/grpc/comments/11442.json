For security reasons we're reluctant to send exception text from server to client.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like your server-side application code to report a problem to your client-side application code, consider using the trailing metadata, status code, and status details facilities? (Unfortunately there's currently a restriction that the status details string must be ASCII; our apologies about that.)"

    "body": "Do you mean that an rpc handler is not allowed to throw an exception? And if it does, then it's undefined behaviour? Such as the gRPC Python server-side runtime never responds back to the client in this scenario? Certainly a rough edge, but thanks for the details on how to handle this properly with metadata/status/details.\r\n\r\nYou mention the reluctance to send exception text from server to client, but it appears it is currently doing that. It only sends it if its ascii, and raises internally (uncaught) if it's not ascii.
