I talked with Craig about it too in the morning.\nI can think of two ways of getting rid of it:\n1. remove/disable the test, if I understand correctly only one test case for httpcli is using it.\n2. at test setup stage, download the file with httpcli and set the environment variable to point to it. I checked it can be downloaded with http.\n\nI tend to disable the test, since it is simple and the test is not very robust anyway.\n"
