You can use `WithAsyncMethod` to specify which methods to make async (as in the `hybrid_end2end_test` example I mentioned above) and then the remaining methods on the service will all be sync. You just need to register that service once and it will get both your sync and async methods. If this doesn't help, please feel free to post your code snippet. Thanks!\r\n"
