    "body": "@kolmodin we are now planning to do 6 weekly releases, this is something we are aspiring toward and we may take longer until we get better at it.\r\nGenerally though, I would recommend you develop against master, especially for a port. The moment you start developing against a point release, rebasing forward will become incrementally harder for you. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately for 1.1 -- we pushed forward bugs we wanted fixed ideally but the need to have a release that was not too far off from base took priority, so we chose to stabilize and release a point release instead. Since then we have been looking at better ways to handle this and make our release process and decision making more understandable. Toward this end, we plan to publish backlogs for the point releases using Github projects. This is coming really soon. \r\n/cc @dgquintas who I am working with to make this happen. \r\n\r\n"

    "body": "@hsaliak Nice to see that you're looking into the release process and try to make it easier to understand - it's appreciated!\r\n\r\nWill the future `1.2` (or `2.0`) be cut from `master`? I eventually would like to make a release of `grpc-haskell`, and it'd be nice to know that the next release based on `master` is not too far out. Will the 6 weekly releases be done from `master`? I ask since the `master` branch itself states that it is version `3.0.0-dev` which gives the impression that it's not anywhere close at being released.\r\n\r\nI guess you don't keep C API compatibility between the `1.x` releases, but you do for the `1.0.x` releases?"
