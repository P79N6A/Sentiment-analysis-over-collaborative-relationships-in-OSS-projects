    "body": "Erm, this change doesn't sound right at all. The point of msys2 is to provide a very thin layer around the Windows API. As a proof, of what I'm saying, you even had to add a few #ifdef inside the code to work around things that weren't, in fact, supported by the Windows API.\n\nThe Windows API can and should in fact be used when compiling under msys2. That change would nullify that and render the code effectively slower. Moreover, the Windows socket API is _not_ posix. Sockets shouldn't be treated as ints there, even using msys2. A lot of Windows-specific calls must be used instead to make everything work properly. For instance, you wouldn't be calling WSAStartup with that change.\n\nWe can definitely compile grpc core under msys2 without trouble, and it seems to work fine. The test suite isn't adapted for it however, but that's another matter. That change is unwarranted and doesn't actually solve any existing problem.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7281574/14537694/ef084cf0-022c-11e6-8090-ce76f994786f.png)\n"
