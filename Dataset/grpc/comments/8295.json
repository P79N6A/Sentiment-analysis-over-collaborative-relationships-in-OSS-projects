    "body": "> nit: compared to the base branch the PR is getting merged into (not necessarily grpc:master)\n\nUpdated along with any other instance I mentioned grpc:master\n\n> so if none of the diff files are in one of these subdirs, the script is going to skip c++ tests? That's actually not good enough - if someone decides to change Makefile, that can totally break C++, but this script doesn't capture that (and it's going to be hard to capture this in general). Perhaps we need a different approach.\n\nI changed it to like how you described it in your brainstorm. Right now, unless a changed file matches a whitelist condition, all tests will be run - more whitelist conditions will need to be added and the current ones verified.\n\nI am working on making the whitelist conditions around sanitizer tests to be as fine-grained as possible. Currently, if a change is made only in test/core, only core tests are run. If a change is made in only src/cpp or test/cpp, then all c++ tests AND core sanitizer tests are run. If a src/core change is made, all tests are run. I am not if this is correct at all, so please correct me if I'm wrong. I'd also like to change it so core sanitizer tests are skipped if only test/cpp files are changed.\n\n> dangerous to hardcode origin/master (people might as well merge into v1.0.x or any other branch in which case this gives them wrong results).\n\nThis is changed. When we configure Jenkins jobs, the arguments `--filter_pr_tests --base_branch $ghprbTargetBranch` should be added when calling run_tests_matrix.py. \n\n> string.split() splits on spaces as well and you really should split on newlines only. Also, please check that the splitting works on windows where you might see \\r\\n line endings (maybe?).\n\nGood catch - I changed it to str.splitlines(), which should work with Windows, but of course I'll test it using Jenkins to make sure.\n\n> I don't quite see what you need the \"ends_with\" triggers for. If you dont' need it now, don't include it and only add it when needed.\n\nI added a use for this; I think it'll be useful to filter out documentation files such as README.md.\n\n> I'm a bit afraid to skip tests based on a shortname of a test (the shortname is basically a freeform string). Maybe we could come up something more bulletproof. \n> On the other hand, perhaps fine for initial experiments (before actually enabling this) if a TODO is added.\n\nTODO added - will address in the future.\n"

Thoughts?\n"
