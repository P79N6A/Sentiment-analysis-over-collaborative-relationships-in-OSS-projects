The goal in either case being not to create a new `grpc-java` gem that only works on JRuby, but to create a version of the `grpc` gem that has a platform of `java`?"

E.g., API-compatible with `grpc-ruby`, don't have to regenerate grpc-related `.proto` files? \r\n* In this case this should probably go into `grpc-ruby` repo, as an addition to the grpc-ruby project. But this would also have to fit in to the same testing setup as grpc.\r\n2. Is a grpc implementation that just works on jruby good enough? Has wrapping the `grpc-java` client from within jruby \"app-level\" code been considered? \r\n3. The main work that the grpc-ruby C extensions do is wrap the grpc C-core library. This could potentially also be wrapped with JNI, and then possibly a lot of the grpc-ruby \"pure-ruby\" code could be reused in that way.\r\n\r\nFor `1)` and <s>`2)`</s>`3)`, these should be introducing fairly big changes to the grpc-ruby project.

    "body": "@apolcyn - what I'm looking for is the ability for Ruby dependency management tools like `bundler` to Do the Right Thing™️ when higher level gems (like `google-cloud-datastore` for example) express a dependency on the `grpc` gem under a JRuby interpreter. From the perspective of the Gemspec, the approach that the [Google Protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/ruby/google-protobuf.gemspec) took is near ideal for my purposes: when executed on the JRuby interpreter, include the jar file rather than the C implementation files. In Protobuf's case, the job of getting your hands on the jar is a little bit more straightforward as it is built from the same repo as the gem, but there already exist [tools](https://github.com/mkristian/jbundler) to leverage Maven dependencies from JRuby rather than store the jar binary alongside the ruby source. From there it is about building a shim over the Java implementation (to the extent necessary) to provide Ruby API compatibility."
