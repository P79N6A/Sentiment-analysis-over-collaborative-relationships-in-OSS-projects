    "body": "Among the tests I ran, only the interop client reported memory leaks. It reported some memory leaks in the C wrapping code and some in the PHP script.\n\nI closed this issue because I fixed the memory leaks in the C wrapping code.\n\nThe reports of memory leaks in the PHP script gave no information about what objects were leaking, or whether those leaks were in the code being tested or the test code itself.\n"
