Because aside from tests, I\r\nam not aware of the reason you'd need the plug-ins to build anything.\r\n\r\nEven if I remove `plugins` from the `all` target, something still attempts to use them.  Look for `$(PROTOC_PLUGINS)` starting from [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/Makefile#L2244).  I don't think I'm building any tests since the way I invoke the build is to just run `make` with no target.\r\n\r\nIt appears that `PROTOC_PLUGINS` automatically gets set to the ones from the grpc tree if `$(HAS_SYSTEM_PROTOBUF)` is true (see [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/Makefile#L794)).  This also seems like a bug.  I would think that if `$(HAS_SYSTEM_PROTOBUF)` is true, then we should check to see if the protoc plugins are also installed and use those instead of building them out of the tree.\r\n\r\nSo to clarify my comment what I'd like is for the Makefile to not attempt to handle multiple toolchains at all and instead use the same toolchain to build everything while providing knobs to turn off parts of the build (like the plugins).  I guess I'm a bit frustrated because it's clear that cross-compiling isn't something that gets tested on every commit (otherwise the AR/HOST_AR issue would have been caught earlier) so it seems better to just drop the support rather than let it bit-rot until someone finds a problem."

    "body": "Aah, the health checking now uses the plugins, indeed. Okay, that's a good reason to have a cause for concern when doing cross compilation. Originally, one could ask to only build the library and no host target would've been touch, that's not the case anymore, which indeed increases the complexity.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm a bit weary of the \"using the plugin from the system\" part, because this isn't something that's supposed to be stable and backward-compatible. The code generated by the plugin isn't subject to semantic versioning, and there has been cases in the past where code generated by a previous version of the plugin wouldn't be compatible anymore with the latest version of the library, from a pure compilation perspective. So I'm not sure doing what you're suggesting is a good idea, since it would become impossible to upgrade grpc with a simple overwrite. Basically you'd need to uninstall the former version before even compiling, which seems odd.\r\n\r\nOn another subject, testing cross compilation on every commit isn't something we're really able to do at the moment for two big reasons:\r\n\r\n1) There are _lots_ of potential cross compilation targets. Be it ARM on GNU Linux, Android, ChromeOS, WebOS, ... or even Intel Alpine Linux. We'd need to find a narrow list of targets we're willing to support first, then expand.\r\n2) The maintenance cost for this isn't trivial. Actually going in and say we're actively going to fully support cross compilation for all times now and forever isn't a decision we should take on lightly.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, finding interested active maintainers for some items in 1) would alleviate 2)."

    "body": "Re: cross-compile being a huge commitment.  I fully understand, cross-compiling is a hairy beast.  I guess what is was trying to get at is that (from a chrome os perspective) cross-compiling should either be fully-supported or not supported at all.  The reason is that we have a lot of tools (like the previously mentioned cross-compile aware wrappers around pkg-config) to deal with packages that don't support cross-compiling.  It's the packages that provide halfway (or best-effort) support that cause the most headaches for us because they don't integrate nicely with any of our existing infrastructure.\r\n\r\nRe: building the plugins.  What I'm suggesting is to provide the following instructions for cross-compiling:\r\n\r\n* Build and install grpc natively for the build machine and then\r\n* Use the plugins from the previous step when cross-compiling\r\n\r\nRather than making it a default, maybe we can gate it behind the GRPC_CROSS_COMPILE option so that nothing changes for the average user.  If you're still worried about backwards compatibility then I won't try to make this change and I'll just stick to cleaning up the host flags and applying those changes to the template."
