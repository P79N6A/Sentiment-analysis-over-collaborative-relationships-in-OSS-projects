Perhaps a grpc-lameduck trailer in a response or a special ping if no RPCs are in flight?\n\nStubby has such a feature (see pg. 234 of http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920041528.do). The even bigger question is how to detect that a backend is ready again. It could be a) in-band with pings, if a connection is open, b) out of band through UDP like Stubby does for inactive connections, c) through the grpclb protocol if you're using it or d) a mix of those.\n"

We are going to use PINGs, but for TCP-level checking, not service-level checking. There's no plan to do UDP health checking, as we want to rely on centralized health checking instead for reduced waste and less DDoS risk.\n\nYou can see our planned use of PING in [a comment of mine](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/1648#issuecomment-207581337). I'm now working on a design to allow doing PING even if there are no outstanding RPCs, which can be used as a poor man's health checking.\n"
