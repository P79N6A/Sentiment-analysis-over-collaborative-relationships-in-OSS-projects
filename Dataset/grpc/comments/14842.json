    "body": "Thanks for the info! Note that we have observed this behavior both for unary and for server-streaming RPCs, but so far only with the Swift (but not the C++) implementation. So I’m less concerned about the discussion about whether it is actually desirable to return responses and non-OK statuses, but rather whether the behavior we are seeing is „expected as implemented“, if you know what I mean ;-) Because my understanding is that once we have passed a message to the transport layer, it should not be able to pre-empt that message just by returning a non-OK status code — but that’s the behavior we are sometimes observing. Again, this is most likely a flaw in our implementation, but any pointers as to what we might be doing wrong (e.g. an explanation of which circumstances would allow these messages to be dropped) would be appreciated."

Since the transport is async in nature, it is possible that the message has not yet gone out when non-OK status code was returned. But yes, we have to hear from someone who knows how this will actually behave in C++ implementation. @vjpai, your thoughts?"
