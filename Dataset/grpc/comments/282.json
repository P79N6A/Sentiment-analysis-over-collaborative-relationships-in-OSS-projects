Is there something I'm missing?\n\nThat's a dealbreaker for grpc on my current work (and that's okay, I'm not here to gripe, things don't always work out), but given that Python is one of the blessed at Google I'd have expected more awareness of its ecosystem and a little better support for the language, even pre-GA. Is this a proto3 limitation or a grpc limitation? Is there any way I, or anyone more familiar with Python than me, can help? If Python 3 were alive, it'd be well into primary school at this point, and we have a lot of industry experience with 2 and 3 compatibility. I'm being diplomatic, but others will not be re: no 3.x compatibility.\nWe're talking about a mostly new library here, not porting Twisted (as @alex will attest).\n\nI was a bit alarmed to see that there was a little bit of drama with Cython and that features were disabled pending the availability of one or two people (i.e., #2394), so I guess some help is needed here? Was Cython a bit of an overreach for the task at hand?\n"

The current reasoning is that we know Cython will effectively fix the vast majority of Python 2->3 compatibility issues (the rest being small syntactic changes throughout the Python code). We know this because it was demonstrated earlier in #2243. Whether or not the rest of the team bites on Cython is partially dependent, currently, on the (relative) stability of the core API. That will be much less of an issue after beta hits. In the meanwhile, I'd rather avoid expending effort on new-target code I intend on scrapping in a short period of time (as far as the current beta timeline is concerned) while we still have a working library for a significant fraction of our targets.\n"

    "body": "@leifurhauks I think the ideal is for everything to run from under the same roof, and I think we consider the tests as part of that notion of everything. There _shouldn't_ be much needed for Python 3 compatibility, but I vaguely recall bumping my head on something when I attempted to take a quick pass at it. Something about protobuf messages somehow not getting turned into bytes by the time they reached the Cython layers. If you want to take a stab at it, or even if you just want to take out some of the low-lying fruit like Py2 -> Py3 renames and such in either the `test` or `grpc` packages, we'd really appreciate it!\n"
