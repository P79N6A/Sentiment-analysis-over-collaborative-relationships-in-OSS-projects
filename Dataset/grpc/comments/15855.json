    "body": "> to build the examples using cmake\r\n\r\nfor now, the examples can be built success with cmake by using set(GPRC_AS_SUBMODULE ON) in the CMakeLists.txt. In this way, one separated grpc is built for every example. \r\n\r\nStill prefer to make the grpc as packages for examples, however, i think the \"install\" step can be ignored since we can manually set the protobuf compiler and other tools and libraries in a CMakeLists.txt, in this way there is no need to install the grpc globally. I just don't know how to do it. thx. \r\n"
