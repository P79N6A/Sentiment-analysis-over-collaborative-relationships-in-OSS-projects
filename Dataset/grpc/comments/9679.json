    "body": "Thanks a lot for your reviews! The missing information is `sin6_flowinfo` and `sin6_scope_id` in `sockaddr_in6`. `sin6_scope_id` can be enclosed in the address as the `zone_id` in `<address>%<zone_id>`. `%` is the delimiter character to distinguish between `<address>` and `<zone_id>`. But this format might conflict with the URI syntax, since the URI syntax is using `%` for percent encoding. It seems there's no syntax for enclosing `sin6_flowinfo` in the address string."
