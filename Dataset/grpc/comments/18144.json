    "body": "It's funny that you bring this up, as we were just having a discussion about api_fuzzer this morning in our team meeting. api_fuzzer isn't a \"real\" fuzzing failure in the way that uri_fuzzer or hpack_fuzzer are. These are just cases of api misues (IMO) and nothing can protect against all cases of API misuse. For example, if you pass the same pointer to free twice, the program will crash. So although we protect against some misuses and assert in others, there are hundreds more that we don't even attempt to protect against. As a result, the team is not even of one mind as to whether or not api fuzzing is worth keeping. That's some context, and why this won't likely get high triage priority. Thanks for the PR and we'll review it at some point, but I wouldn't suggest that it will get a prompt reaction.\r\n"
