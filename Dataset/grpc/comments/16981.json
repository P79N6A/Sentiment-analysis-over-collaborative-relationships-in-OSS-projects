This only works for me because I send a heartbeat from the server that is able to detect a non-gracefully disconnected client (I've had trouble in the past with ungraceful client disconnects [caused from client hardware losing power] causing indefinitely hanging connections). There was nothing unusual about my python or golang clients."
