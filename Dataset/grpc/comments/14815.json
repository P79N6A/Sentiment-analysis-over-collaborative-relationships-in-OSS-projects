The latter uses the older TLS version and is the one used for running Python tests. We do a few `pip install x` commands as prebuild steps using the version installed by brew and have had no issues with those. The binaries we use for the prebuild steps are:\r\n```\r\n++ which python2\r\n/usr/local/bin/python2\r\n++ which pip\r\n/usr/local/bin/pip\r\n```"
