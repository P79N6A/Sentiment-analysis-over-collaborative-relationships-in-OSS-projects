    "body": "So the error reporting mechanism in the core library is two fold:\n- API misuse is reported via grpc_call_error codes as return values from functions such as grpc_call_send_batch - these failures indicate API misuse, which typically results from broken invariants in higher level code. We should _NEVER_ see these. Ordinarily we'd make these asserts in the C code, but for languages such as Python which have their own runtime exceptions, we want to translate these to them.\n- Runtime errors - things such as trying to send on a disconnected channel - are reported via grpc_op_errors as part of the completion event for each queued operation. These are the error codes you're wondering about Andrey.\n\nWhat I think is happening is we're somehow misclassifying an error condition and not reporting it up from surface/call.c in the correct fashion, leading to this assert.\n"

This gives no way to get know for C++ high level code about error and return 'false' from writer->Write(). Passing 'result' into grpc_cq_end_op_complete() instead of GRPC_OP_OK solves problem with returning 'false' from writer->Write(), and loop finishes fine. \n\nBut unfortunatelly this fix leads to next error in server.cc:143 after finishing loop : \nassertion failed: cq_.Pluck(&buf).\nIt is because of cq_.Pluck(&buf) returns 'false' and GPR_ASSERT(cq_.Pluck(&buf)) aborts server. \nRemoving GPR_ASSERT() solves my problem with server crashing when client disappears.\n\nSo, I suggest that cq_.Pluck() CAN return 'false' on RUN-TIME errors. The C++ code MUST NOT abort or crash on RUN-TIME errors\n"
