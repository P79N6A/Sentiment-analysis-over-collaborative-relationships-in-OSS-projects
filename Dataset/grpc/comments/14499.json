    "body": "To add a little context how this affects us (GitLab): since we upgraded our Ruby gRPC clients to 1.8.3 we see that the moment new gRPC server processes get deployed, a large number of clients start throwing GRPC::Unavailable errors with the message `14:Endpoint read failed`. They do not recover if we force them to create a new GRPC client stub; the only thing that works is to restart the client process.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround we are adding an exception handler in our application that will restart the current Ruby process the moment a `14:Endpoint read failed` exception is caught. This is a heavy-handed and desperate workaround.\r\n\r\nIf we were to upgrade to grpc 1.9, where the process just hangs instead of throwing an exception, things would be even worse because a hung Ruby process is harder to detect and react to than an exception.\r\n\r\nSo we are now stuck on grpc 1.8 in our Ruby clients.\r\n\r\nIf there is any way we can help diagnosing or fixing this issue please let us know. Thanks in advance!\r\n"
