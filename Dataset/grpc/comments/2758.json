    "body": "@DavidPhillipOster: There was a security concern that making non-SSL calls by just using `\"http://\"` before the server address was too subtle (for the implications it has). That a library surface that cries \"this is insecure\" when disabling SSL was preferable. This change addresses that concern.\n\nSide effects are that now the ObjC wrapper always passes the URL scheme to the wrapped C gRPC library (because they have plans for fanzy schemes to select how addresses are resolved), and so only tries to add a default 443 port when the user merely wrote a host name (without scheme nor port).\n"
