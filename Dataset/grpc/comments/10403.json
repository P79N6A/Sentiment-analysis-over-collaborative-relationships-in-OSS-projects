    "body": "I should also note that since the projects default to Treat Warnings As Errors (/WX) , I had to add the following to Disable Specific Warnings: 4996;4273. Since this is an external dependency, the warning can't be fixed unless c-ares is updated and used here. My understanding is there is a way to set certain warnings to be disabled in CMakeLists. I don't understand how, but it seems prudent to do so here."
