    "body": "@ctiller, can you take a look at the Windows test failures and tell me if you think they're flaky or are actually caused by this PR?  Based on the output, I'd say they're unrelated -- the failures often occur in the test case that does not use the service config, so should not be affected by this -- but I find it suspicious that the failures are occurring in the particular set of tests that this PR is touching.\n\nI would ask Nico about this, but since he's out, you're my next best bet for Windows expertise.  Please feel free to redirect me if there's someone more appropriate to look at this.  Thanks!\n"
