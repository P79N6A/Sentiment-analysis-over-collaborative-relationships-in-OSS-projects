    "body": "The segfault occurred during ruby server shutdown.  \n\nRuby server shutdown has been re-written to use a different shutdown api in #1731.  As a consequence of those changes, this particular failure is unlikely to occur again.   Closing as this scenario was sporadic and won't occur in future test runs.\n"
