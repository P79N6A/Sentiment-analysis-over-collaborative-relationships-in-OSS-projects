That's why the switch was made from having people specify `\"http://\"` to having them call `[GRPCCall useInsecureConnectionsForHost:myHost]` (as in the test Michael pointed to). The reason is we don't want anybody using cleartext inadvertently.\n\nThe scheme part of the server's URL doesn't need to be specified anymore.\n\nI'm currently going over all samples to ensure they're up-to-date (#3371).
