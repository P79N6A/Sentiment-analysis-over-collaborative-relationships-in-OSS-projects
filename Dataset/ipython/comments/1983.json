I had 0.13.dev before it was distributed with EPD 7.3-1 and after installing it I thought it was upgraded to the version of EPD, but as my private install went into ~/Library, I still had the old one active. \nSorry for the noise, but maybe another qualifier in the output of --version would have made me realise that something is old?\n"
