    "body": "I think this is covered in the doc of autoreload:\n\n> Reloading Python modules in a reliable way is in general\n> difficult, and unexpected things may occur.\n\nThe problem is that python imports are cached, so while we do our best to replace things\nwhere we can, you end up with 2 instances of your `base` module, that are the same (content)\nbut not the same (object id). Which to some weird case like an object not being an instance of it's class.\nYou can poke around and have [3+1 = 255](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/05/09/why-python-is-slow/) also if you like. \n\nThese are some corner case you hit when you do things (like autoreaload) you are not supposed to do with the language. \n\nIf you find a fix, PR welcome, but this is not something we will actively work on, so I'm going to close. \n\nThanks\n"
