    "body": "I am going to close this one as the read-only design discussions will happen offline.  Once we know what we are going to go, we can open a new issue to track that work.\n\nIn terms of the print view, I think we really want to use the saved version and I don't think we want to trigger saves on print.  Those two actions should be orthogonal.  As we move to a version controlled/auto-saving setup, it will be even more the case the print will always use the likely-very-recently-saved version.  I don't want to break that model by trying to save to temp files that are not the real saved version.\n"
