At a glance, that looks sensible, and I don't think I've seen any examples where the comma is after the newline, so that's probably not a big concern.\n\nJust to note: we prefer if you don't merge master back into feature branches, since it complicates the commit graph. In general, it should be fine to just make the change and leave it until it's merged into master. If it ends up unable to merge cleanly, you can rebase it, do a forced push, and make a note on the pull request that you've done that.\n"

This will ensure that the problem doesn't recur in the future.  You don't need to write up a new file, you can simply add a new test to the existing test_inputsplitter.py.\n\nWith a small test as indicated above, this will be good to go.  Thanks a lot!\n"

That's weird.  Are you sure that you ran iptest in the same\nenvironment that is finding your development copy of IPython?  It's\npossible you picked up the system-wide iptest and that it ran the test\nsuite for your system-installed IPython, not actually finding your\ndevelopment tree.\n\niptest is actually just this code:\n\n```\nfrom IPython.testing.iptest import main; main()\n```\n\nso you could also run that at the command line if iptest is finding\nsomething wrong.\n"

That way of running the test suite doesn't support\nindividual test selection like `iptest` does, it's just for\nwhole-suite running, but it does produce identical results to iptest\non my system.
