    "body": "> I agree not referring to the private variable. But I thought that a method telling if a tooltip is visible may be handy. Anyways, I made the function return a boolean depending on whether it actually removed a tooltip or not.\n\nYes, a method that says wether the tooltip is visible or pending would be good too. This might be the subject of another PR maybe :-) \n\nThis looks good to me.\n"
