    "body": "@ellisonbg, I agree on the trash action that perhaps it should be a little harder to achieve.  Perhaps what we should have instead is just a menu action at the bottom of the File menu called 'Close Notebook'  that shuts down the kernel, and in the confirmation dialog for that there could be a checkbox (off by default) called 'Delete notebook file on close'.  That would let people shut down cleanly 'scratch' notebooks, nuking the associated file on the way out.  If something along these lines sounds good to you, we can implement it later.\n\nI've gone over the code as well.  Keeping in mind I'm a JS newbie, it looks very clean to me.  I have to say that I wish JS had a more declarative way to specify things like the toolbar, b/c there's a lot of repetitive boilerplate in there.  But oh well, not much we can do about that at this point.\n\nSo in the spirit of keeping things moving swiftly, and since you've addressed all the points in the discussion above and the code looks great, I'm merging this puppy.  Great job!\n"
