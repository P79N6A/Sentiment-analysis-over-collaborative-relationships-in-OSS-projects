    "body": "Following up on the other issues, this is a question about the QtConsole, not IPython itself. IPython (the Kernel) can't really do this as configuration, but we could add an option to the QtConsole to allow HTML output. It couldn't be done for just pandas though, it would have to be all or nothing. The reason being that IPython, which knows *what* it is displaying, doesn't know what the frontend (QtConsole or notebook) supports or not. But the QtConsole only knows that it got HTML output, not that it got the tiny subset of HTML that it can support, or that it was a DataFrame.\r\n\r\nBut we could have an off-by-default option to enable HTML in the QtConsole for users who prefer semi-supported HTML output to none at all."
