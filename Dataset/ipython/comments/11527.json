    "body": "It seems like this can be fixed by adding\r\n`self.init_alias()`\r\nat line 1435 of core/interactiveshell.py under the reset function after\r\n`# Restore the default and user aliases`\r\n`self.alias_manager.clear_aliases()`\r\n`self.alias_manager.init_aliases()`\r\n\r\nMy only qualm with recommending this fix is that I don't know what the intended behavior here is (as I haven't contributed to this repo before). In the meantime, you can always get around this bug by using `!clear` instead of `%clear` if that helps."
