    "body": "You'll need to work in two files,\nPython - `ipython/IPython/html/widgets/widget_string.py`\nJS - `ipython/IPython/html/static/widgets/js/widget_string.js`\n\nThe widget framework works by syncing traitlets with `sync=True` applied to them.  The first step will be to add a traitlet to the `TextWidget` in the Python file. Something like \n\n``` python\nplaceholder = Unicode('Type here...', sync=True)\n```\n\nThe second step is to listen to that value in Javascript.  There are two ways to do this.  Right now most widgets are implemented such that all changes are handled in the `update:` function.  `update:` will fire when ever a value (any and all values) changes in the model.  The new way, which I'm trying to use more often, is to use Backbone trait specific events.  I recommend you use the new method but in the end it's up to you. \n\nThe syntax to register an event handler is \n\n``` js\nthis.model.on('change:TRAITNAME', function(model, value, options) {this.HANDLER();}, this);\n```\n\nwhere `TRAITNAME` would be `placeholder` in this example\nand `HANDLER` would be the name of the method to handle the changes.  You could just as easily inline the function here using a closure.\n\nSee the `AccordionView` constructor in `ipython/IPython/html/static/widgets/widget_selectioncontainer.js` for an example of how this is done.\n\nYou'll be adding this handling code inside `TextView` in `ipython/IPython/html/static/widgets/widget_string.js`.  `this.$textbox` is a jQuery handle to the textbox control.  You'll have to lookup how to set the Bootstrap placeholder text via Javascript.\n\nLet me know if I can help some more...  I look forward to seeing the changes.\n"
