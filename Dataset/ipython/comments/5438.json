    "body": "Hi @juhasch ,\n\nThis is a difference between Pandoc (nbconvert -> latex) and Marked.js (notebook).  I've created a list of all of the known differences [here - http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/jdfreder/6734825](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/jdfreder/6734825)  The one you mentioned is here http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/jdfreder/6734825#Math .  NOTE: This notebook must be downloaded and run to render correctly (since it uses JS to invoke marked in real time).\n\nI don't think there is anything we can do to change this behavior of Pandoc so that it parses gfm the same way Marked.js does.\n"
