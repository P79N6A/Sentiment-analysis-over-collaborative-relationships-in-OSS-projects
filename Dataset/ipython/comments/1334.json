    "body": "Thanks @fawce!\n\n@takluyver, I tested this on Firefox and Chrome (linux), with an Apple keyboard, and I see no problems.  Alt (meta) and the Apple key are not captured by this, only `Control-S` works.  And I assume that @fawce is on OSX, so for him this makes `Cmd-S` (Apple key) work as well.\n\nIt is indeed a big usability win, so I'm merging it now.  There's always the chance we can get a bug report from some user on some combination of platform/browser, but the only way to find out is to merge and put it out for public use.\n"
