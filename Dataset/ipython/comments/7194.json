I didn't provide an example of setting it in my extension, because I never really use non-default profiles in any case.\n\nWe could check whether an IPython application is running, and get the profile directory from it if so, but I'd be inclined not to:\n1. It feels too magical to have a script that will behave differently if run inside IPython and if you run it with `python install.py`, when it's not obvious that that would happen.\n2. It's not yet clear what will happen to profiles in the IPython/Jupyter split. There's a distinct possibility that only IPython will preserve profiles, and Jupyter will just have a single configuration directory. In that case, we'd be putting in complexity only to pull it out again in a couple of months.\n"
