That's probably why `LooseVersion` isn't always comparable - there's no right way to do it.\n\nLooking at their source code, it looks like PySide pre-releases would have a version like `1.1.2~alpha1` - which is comparable, but strictly less than `1.1.2`. ([ref](http://qt.gitorious.org/pyside/pyside/blobs/master/CMakeLists.txt#line61)). PyQt appears to go with `snapshot-4.10-f0118624625e` (from a development snapshot tarball) - which can't sensibly be compared to anything.\n"

In this way, a snapshot will always pass the minimum version check, and rightly so.\n\n> we ourselves use 0.13.dev < 0.13.1 for IPython\n\nWe actually use `0.13dev` on _both_ sides of 0.13.0.  But the case remains that nobody using X.Y.dev of any version other than _today's_ is valid.  It seems to me to always be appropriate to interpret dev as 'latest'.\n"
