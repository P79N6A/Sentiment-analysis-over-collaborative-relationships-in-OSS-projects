    "body": "It's strange that the qtconsole and notebook would behave differently, since they use the exact same kernel code.\n\nI should specify that you don't have to use pylab-mode, but you should at least inform IPython about the GUI eventloop you will be using (e.g. `ipython notebook --gui=qt`).  It just isn't reasonable to have multiple eventloops play well together unless one knows about the other.  And the kernel's knowledge of which eventloop to work with is established at launch time (it determines which Kernel subclass to use).  \n\nThat said, when matplotlib is not interactive, you have to mess around with show(), and closing windows, etc. to get back and forth between the plot windows being responsive and the ability to run new code.\n"

If you run the code snippet, the figure window appears. Close it, arrow up to get the same code and run it again: the figure window appears again.\n\nMatplotlib uses the default backend TkAgg (and I am using Ubuntu).\n"
