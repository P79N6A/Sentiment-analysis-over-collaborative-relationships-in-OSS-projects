So it would require an interested user who needs it, to invest\nsome time on the effort.  The main code is in `lib/bacgkroundjobs.py`,\nand we can get the magic back from the 0.10.x tags.  It would be a\nmatter of reworking that code, validating it in the various user\nenvironments (terminal, qt console, notebook) and adding proper tests\nto it.\n\nInteresting and possibly useful, but at this point in time somewhat\nlow-priority, I'm afraid.\n\nI'll leave this open though, so others can find it, and if an\ninterested user (including yourself) wants to jump on it we'll be\nhappy to review any relevant Pull Requests.\n"

BTW, mind putting your script in tools/?  That way we can\nall use it and refine it over time.  I have github-stats in there, so\nit might be worth merging some of the  code which is probably\nduplicate between the two...\n\nNo need for a PR for that, just go ahead and do it at your leisure.\n"

Though from your use case, it seem like [ipyparallel](http://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and using Python Futures might be more appropriate. \n"
