Basically, this change would make it a little harder (double-click) to 'get in' to a text cell for editing, but if matched with also being harder to lose the editing state, it could overall be an improvement.  Right now I find that often I'm editing a text cell and switch over to another window to copy some information, and it's frustrating to have to click around to edit again.  Thoughts?\n"

So there's definitely a focus issue introduced by this\nparticular PR.\n\nBTW, Brian: I don't know if you're aware of the 'git-mrb' script in\ntools/.  It's super useful for rapidly testing branches from people\nwhose remotes you track (I track those of all the core committers for\nease of merging).  I wrote it recently and it really simplifies/speeds\nup the testing of PRs a lot.  Let me know if you need  any pointers.\n"
