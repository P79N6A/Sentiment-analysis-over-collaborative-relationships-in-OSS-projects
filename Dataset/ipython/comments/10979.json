It is a complex enough problem that a team of interested people are more change to do something that work.\r\n\r\nI've recently learn about http://gittup.org/tup/, which seem to be able to intercept IO operation (which is one of the reason why dependency tracking is hard). \r\n\r\nAs you guessed, this is likely both a backend and frontend extension, though if you \"tag\" manually, it should be doable only as frontend-only extension. You'll have to play with the `Cell.prototype.execute`method and make it submit dependent cells if these have not been executed.\r\n\r\nHope that give you something to start with. \r\n"
