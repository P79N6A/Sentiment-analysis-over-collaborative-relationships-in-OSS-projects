    "body": "@Carreau I disagree. This situation is _extremely_ bad. We have made a number of changes to how focus is managed and they are cooperating in a particularly nasty way right now to make the UI basically unusable. Just this morning I realized that part of the problem is that simple entering command mode causes a focus jump. Some of the changes we need to revert:\n- We should not be focusing cells when they enter command mode.\n- We should not be focusing anything when the toolbar is used.\n- We should not be disabling keyboard handling when the toolbar is used. When we made that change I was hesitant, but willing to try it. It simply doesn't work.\n\nSummary: we should almost never manually focus any element on the page. The more we do this, the more the different manual focus events start to \"argue\" leading to crazy focus jumps. As far as I am concerned this is a complete blocker for 3.1.\n"

The only calls to focus_cell should be the ones that were in the original keyboard manager. The actions.js PR included a number of new calls to focus cell that don't belong there.\n- Audit the code base for other calls to focus_cell and remove ones that are not there for good reason.\n\nBasically I think we need to go back to where things were closer to the 2.0 release. I recall that all of the problems we now have are _new_ since then. What @jdfreder and I found when we were writing all of the keyboard handling stuff is that there should be almost no calls to focus_cell - everytime we tried to put one in somewhere it lead to these problems. The calls we had in the 2.0 release were highly tuned and well understood.\n"
