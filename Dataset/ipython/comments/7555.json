Now it's possible to click on other cells, and visually be in command or edit mode on another cell, even typing into another cell, and the IPython keyboard shortcuts are still disabled. Clicking save in the toolbar brings the shortcuts back, presumably because they're restored when focus returns from the toolbar.\n"
