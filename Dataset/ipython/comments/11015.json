I'll go ahead and close this here, since the classic Jupyter notebook UI does not have a representation for just JSON mime types, your example will render as `<__main__.Foo at 0x107d48b70>` in the classic notebook (and in jupyterlab's notebook component)."

You get the same result in jupyterlab:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/881019/36573320-ffdd2966-188b-11e8-8902-cdb2076a4b00.png)\r\n\r\nIt *might* be an issue in jupyterlab - https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/packages/json-extension\r\n\r\n...but I was under the impression that the underlying machinery was in ipython itself and the jupyterlab extension was just to the output from ipython and displayed it.\r\n\r\nEdit: Perhaps it's an issue in both the jupyterlab  and nteract display implementations in that they don't recognise any metadata other than `expanded`."
