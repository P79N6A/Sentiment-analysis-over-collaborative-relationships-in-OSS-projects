    "body": "I'd argue that this is a bug with pdb++, because it calls itself pdb, and aims to be a drop-in replacement, but isn't. For example, if someone made an os++ module, or a sys++ module that aimed to be like the standard library counterparts, but actually also clobbered the standard libary names, it wouldn't be ipython's job to make sure they are supported.\n"
