    "body": "Looks good to me.  :+1: \n\nThe HTML tests for the string widgets are in `ipython/IPython/html/tests/widgets/widget_string.js` and all of the utility functions (and base class) can be found in `ipython/IPython/html/tests/util.js`.  Programming tests for the JS stuff is a little wonky because you have to deal with two execution contexts.  I think @ivanov wrote a nice excerpt about this [here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Dev%3A-Testing#wrapping-your-head-around-the-javascript-within-javascript).\n\n> I also updated the Widget Basics example notebook -- is this the appropriate place to mention placeholders, or should I move the example somewhere else?\n\nSounds good.\n"
