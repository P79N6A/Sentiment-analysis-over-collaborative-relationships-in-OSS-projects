    "body": "pinging @fperez, based on his reply on-list.  We previously shipped a pylab profile, which set the backend to Qt, among other things, and showed an example of inheriting config from the default profile.  In this PR, I've removed the profile, and changed the Start Menu item to use the default profile.  Does that sound good?  Another option would be for the Start Menu item to still load `--profile=pylab`, even if that doesn't exist.  This would allow users to have separate config triggered by each menu item, which not be enabled in the current state of the PR.\n"

    "body": "If config is inherited, the most obvious effect of using a separate profile is a separate history. On the one hand, it's quite natural to have a separate history for pylab, because you're using a lot of names that aren't present in the default IPython shell. On the other hand, a unified history is possibly the 'least surprise' option, and is handy if you want to take code from non-pylab to pylab.\n\nI'm currently mildly in favour of using the default profile (the current state of the PR), but I've flip flopped twice in writing this comment.\n"

    "body": "I agree that it's great to have a separate profile to distinguish the histories, but we should go for simplicity and generality.  I think the cleanest solution is to go with `--pylab`, nuke the weird pylab profile, and then simply have a clean explanation of how to create a profile that inherits from another, along with explaining how this impacts history.  This gives the benefits of these ideas to anyone (not just those using pylab), and makes the out-of-the-box behavior simpler and closer to what people do in the command-line (where they've learned to type `ipython --pylab` from countless tutorials).\n"
