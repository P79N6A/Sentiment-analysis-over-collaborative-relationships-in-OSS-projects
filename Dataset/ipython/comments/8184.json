    "body": "Hi, \n\nSorry for the time to respond. We are strongly pushing people toi push as much as possible to external libraries, So as long as you can do things outside of IPython in a non-super hackish manner the answer will most likely be that No, we won't add it. \n\nWe are though working on static widgets, in general, and I think that his is only a particular case of static widget. Unless I missundertsand what you are asking. \n\nDoes that answer some of your question/concerns ?\n"

See the template used from https://github.com/PBrockmann/ipython_animation_javascript_tool/blob/master/animation_template.html \nIndeed I was hopping some interest to see this piece of code implemented as it has been done with the class IPython.display.YouTubeVideo. \nThus, anyone could have been able to use the IPython.display.DisplayFramesAnimation class.\n"
