    "body": "Yup, this is a result of having `__main__` represent two different things. It's trying to issue a warning for line 1 of your code entered interactively, which is run as part of the `__main__` module. But the lines are coming from the other `__main__` module - the file that Python ran to launch IPython, or to launch the kernel. So the text you see is the first line of that file (the `This is separate...` text is a docstring).\r\n\r\nIt's a bit messy and confusing, but it's never really been a big enough problem to be worth fixing."

    "body": "I got curious and went to see what it would take to fix it. We could quite easily leave the code out of all warnings attributed to `__main__`, but that's a bit unsatisfactory. Showing the correct code is impossible for IPython, as far as I can tell, because the warnings module looks up code in its own peculiar idiom.\r\n\r\nTracebacks and pdb find the file by doing:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nframe.f_code.co_filename\r\n```\r\n\r\nWarnings finds the file by doing the equivalent of:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nframe.f_globals.get('__file__', sys.argv[0])\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe give each input a unique fake filename for its code, so it can be looked up for tracebacks. But they all have to share the global namespace, so I don't think we can distinguish them for warnings at the moment. I've just commented about this on an [ancient Python issue](https://bugs.python.org/issue1692664)."
