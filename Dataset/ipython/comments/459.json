That also indicates that run_cell is not the only code that calls prefilter_lines, and run_cell _is_ the only case where a trailing newline is needed (or even desired), due to ast.parse (on 2.6 only, if I recall).\n"

For example right now if users type !nano in the Qt console, they get a gory mess without any easy way to unwedge themselves.\n\nBut that's a different story, not something to hold this PR on.\n\nOnce the above is handled, merge away!  Thanks for the great work!\n\nps - don't forget to close #297 if none of the commit messages will auto-close it.\n"
