The PDF UI should probably not be conditional on there also being an image (for instance, it technically makes sense for a user to _only_ have PDF figures if their goal is just nbconvert latex output, rather than needing interactive inline figures.\n\nI think it's appropriate for this initial PR to do a little bit less:\n1. define the PDF formatter\n2. tell jsonutil about PDF as a binary format\n3. provide an API function for enabling PDF output for matplotlib figures\n\nWe can save the js UI for PDFs for later work.\n"

I think that `figure_format` is the right place to configure this, but currently that is set up so that only one figure type can be chosen at a time.  I, for one, have a definite use-case in mind where I want two figure types turned on at once (png and pdf).  Should we allow only one of png/retina/svg and have pdf turned on and off separately (could get complicated quickly if more figure types get added, for instance eps), or should we allow any combination of figure types to be turned on (simpler, the potential harm I see is larger notebooks)?\n\nIf the latter, is there already an extant config mechanism in place for turning on a set of options?  I'm imagining something like\n\n```\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = {'svg', 'pdf', 'eps'}\n```\n\nI'm also happy to remove the JS stuff for now -- I think my changes are somewhat kludgy as is (doesn't work for SVG+PDF, for example), so will need more careful work before they are ready to be incorporated.  I'll continue using what I have now, though.  It works perfectly for me and my use-case. :-)\n"

If you're willing to wait perhaps several months, I'm happy to spend the time, as I have it, to try to figure this out.\n\nRegarding the JS, I'm no UX expert, so perhaps it is best to let someone else tackle that.\n\nI'll take a stab at a todo list:\n1. Remove changes to JS\n2. Turn `figure_format` into `figure_formats` -- a set/list of representations to send to the frontend\n3. Develop alternate JS for displaying whatever set of representations are provided\n4. Refactor mimetypes system to be more general\n\nI think that, if 1 and 2 are done, perhaps you could merge this, and leave 3 and 4 for future work?\n"

In a separate PR, we would like to follow up with a general API with the backend that allows multiple output formats to be enabled.\n- [ ] `OutputArea.append_pdf` should just display a \"Download PDF\" button/link and not try to wrap png/jpeg/svg output. IOW the handling of these different output types should be orthogonal. In this PR, the \"Download PDF\" button will only show if there are no other output types. In the future, we will add UI support for changing which format is being viewed.\n"
