    "body": "I've tracked it down, and the issue is that an exception is being raised inside the `show.mainloop()` call, rather than during the execution of user code.  I'm not sure if this is a matplotlib bug or not.\n\nI tested, and the behavior is the same in IPython 0.13.2 as 1.0.0, so if anything changed it was probably on matplotlib's side. It is also not restricted to the kernel model, nor the OS X backend. I can reproduce the behavior with terminal IPython and Qt backend.\n\nThere is a general question about what we should do with exceptions raised inside matplotlib's eventloop, rather than during user code execution.  For instance, this script:\n\n``` python\nfrom matplotlib import dates\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nplt.plot([0])\nplt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(dates.DateFormatter('%Y/%m/%d'))\nplt.show()\n```\n\nwill raise `ValueError: ordinal must be >= 1` on `%run`, but it will raise again inside the eventloop every time you try to resize the figure window.\n\nI think we just need a _third_ excepthook, not for user code, that specifically displays as: \"exception raised in mpl eventloop: ...\", and try to ensure this is the eventloop hooked up when matplotlib is in its eventloop.\n"
