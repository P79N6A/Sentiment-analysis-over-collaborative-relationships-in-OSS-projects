It runs with the virtualenv active, and a fresh checkout of github master as the working directory.\n\nIf you just install IPython inside the virtualenv (python setup.py install), it shouldn't interfere with your normal installation at all, so it's safe to leave it. If you need to remove it, you can delete the folder the virtualenv is based in, or call `pip uninstall ipython` with the virtualenv active.\n\nUpload location: if you can put it somewhere on archive.ipython.org - maybe make a new testresults folder, and call it testresults-win-latest.zip. I'll set ShiningPanda up so that you make an HTTP request when you've uploaded the file, which will trigger it to download and add the results.\n\n```\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/slave/local/lib\nexport ZMQ_DIR=/home/slave/local\npip install nose coverage\npip install pyzmq\npip install readline\n\nrm -rf build/\npython setup.py install\n\nmkdir -p results\ncd results\nrm -f *.xunit.xml\nrm -f *.coverage.xml\niptest --with-xml-coverage --with-xunit\n```\n\nThis will create *.xunit.xml and *.coverage.xml files, which you can zip and upload.\n"
