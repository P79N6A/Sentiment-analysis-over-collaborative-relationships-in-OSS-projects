    "body": "The flip side is that adding blank padding decreases the amount of useful information on screen, although of course information density isn't the last word in interface design.\n\nMaybe how noticeable this is depends on the window manager - on my system, the Qt console window has a small shadow, so there's a clear border at the bottom, and I've never felt that it was awkward.\n"

    "body": "Hi, \n\nThe qtconsole has been moved to https://github.com/jupyter/qtconsole, and this issue had no activity for quite some time. If this is still relevant I would suggest this issue to be reopen on the above cited repository. \n\nThis will allow us to keep the number of IPython issues smaller and focussed on IPython. As currently there is an extremely high number of opened issues , it make it really hard to find if a problem is actually known, or going to be worked one. \n\nFeel free to reopen if need, for the time being I'm going to close this. \n\nThanks.\n"
