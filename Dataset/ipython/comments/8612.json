Yes, any requests that actually reach the notebook server will be logged, which is why I suspect you need to debug your vagrant network setup.  I would start this by creating a toy application that doesn't involve IPython and trying to connect to it. Once you are certain that you can connect to a particular port in the app in vagrant, then try it with IPython.\n"

This [post](http://www.howtogeek.com/122641/how-to-forward-ports-to-a-virtual-machine-and-use-it-as-a-server/) tells you the buttons to click.\nBut basically, \n\na. navigate to the settings of the virtual machine image that vagrant controls using the virtualbox GUI\nb. click on the `network` pane, uncollapse the `advanced` setting then click on `Port Forwarding`  \nc. make sure that you have set the ports correctly to forward your Mac requests to the ports where IPython Notebook is running on virtualbox \n\nI imagine you can configure the same settings via the vagrant file but I have not played with vagrant that much.\n\nIf you want to use PySpark via the IPython Notebook interface, you have to configure a IPython profile called `pyspark` so the SparkContext is initialized correctly when you start the IPython Notebook. [This](http://ramhiser.com/2015/02/01/configuring-ipython-notebook-support-for-pyspark/) is a good post for guiding you how to do so. \n\nLastly, I had to add the line `c.NotebookApp.ip = '*'` that I mentioned earlier in `~/.ipython/profile_pyspark/ipython_notebook_config.py`.\n"
