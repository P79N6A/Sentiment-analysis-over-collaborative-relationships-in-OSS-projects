I really like it! \nI've added a bunch of comments - a separate PR against your would have been possible, but I was to lazy to do so :sweat_smile: \n\nA basic, but fundamental, issue is the splitting of the content into several individual parts. You have already mentioned that. In this context it is IMO important to decide which significance the Notebook App will get within the whole IPython world. If it will be the number one feature everybody is advised to use, than \"all\" of the IPython features could be introduced based on their Notebook appearance. If it is \"just\" one of several frontends, it might be a bit trickier to split the information into general parts (related to all IPython products) and frontend specific. In the latter case, the current PR might need some excessive rework.\n"

Sawyer, author of some moderately well-known maths pedagogy books, such as _Mathematician's Delight_) used to talk about \"reconstructing the examiner\" in an exam, to try and work out what _they_ wanted _you_ to write.\n\nHere it is the same, you have to work out what _they_ had in _their_ head, what they actually wrote down, and then how to bridge the enormous chasm between the two ;)\n\nLet me take a break from this today and make the changes tomorrow.\nOf course I agree with you about adding links etc -- this just interrupts the writing process, and is a completely automatic, tedious thing (indeed, _should_ be automated).\n\nThanks again and looking forward to the next one!

Not at this point.  We plan to write all of our narrative docs in notebooks, but simple _reference_ docs still belong in plain sphinx.  As time goes on, we expect docs written for sphinx to shrink, and notebook docs to grow.  However, part of that is actually sphinx exporters for nbconvert, so that we can write notebooks that actually get rendered along with everything else in the sphinx build.\n\n> In fact, is there an easy way of incorporating output of nbconvert into the sphinx workflow?\n\nNot yet, that's one of the things we will be working on. NbConvert has to finish existing first.\n"
