    "body": "This is actually a confusing issue of scope in Python. A great [notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rasbt/python_reference/blob/master/tutorials/scope_resolution_legb_rule.ipynb) was recently posted exploring the issue.\n\nThe issue here being that all of your `move` functions have references to the same `axis` and `direction` variables, which are resolved at call time, not definition time.\n\nHere's [an illustration](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/minrk/fbecdd17e5cc9d6e9b88) of achieving your goal with closures.\n\nThe gist is to use a closure to fix the values of axis and direction at definition time with a closure:\n\n``` python\npos = [0,0]\nfor axis,axislabel in enumerate('xy'):\n    for direction in (+1,-1):\n        def make_move(ax, d):\n            def move(inst):\n                pos[ax] = pos[ax] + d\n                print(ax, d, pos)\n            return move\n        move = make_move(axis, direction)\n        ...\n```\n"
