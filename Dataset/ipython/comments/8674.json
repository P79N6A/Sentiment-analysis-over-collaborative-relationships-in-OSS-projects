    "body": "I think I know why that is: rst doesn't define heading styles for particular levels, it just uses the sequence of different kinds of heading markup, treating the first one it sees as level 1, the second as level 2, and so on. By convention, we typically use `===` for the first level, `---` for the second, and so on.\n\npandoc is presumably designed to convert an entire document, whereas we're giving it one cell at a time. So in each cell it makes the first heading level it sees `===`, rather than consistently picking based on heading level.\n\nWe could concatenate all the markdown cells with some recognisable marker, convert to rst and then split them up again. But that seems awkward. I'm not sure what a better solution would be, short of changing how pandoc works.\n"
