    "body": "Thanks for your patience - you do take your life into your hands, working on these things with nitpicky people like me.  This is looking nice.\n\nTry [this base.css](https://github.com/minrk/ipython/blob/notebook-header/IPython/frontend/html/notebook/static/css/base.css), and tell me what you think.  It makes significantly fewer changes, which I think may account for some of the difference between your experience and mine.\n\nAll these issues are a consequence of all the elements in the header being text of moderately similar size, but in different containers.  This would not be a problem if they were of sufficiently different size, or were separated by sufficient distance, or if our 'logo' were not plain text.\n\nNow my only disappointment is with the fact that we have chosen a font that makes the 'logo' (IP[y]:) part look very nice, but is pretty poor for actual text.  But I think that ship sailed long ago, and is not pertinent here.\n\nSince we intend to ultimately redo _most_ of the UI elements we have right now, I shouldn't be too picky. So I think this can go in as is with my minor adjustments if you think they are sensible, after you revert the bundling of the font, which isn't being used anymore.\n"

I've rebase the whole thing and force pushed.\nThe last thing i'm hesitating on is used a logo of just the right size (bad when zooming in)\nOr use a bigger logo scaled with css (FF make a poor job of scaling-down on debian)\n\nI've also added the logo source, not sure if it is very usefull. All in 3 commits so you can just cherry-pick or throw away when you'll be ok with merging.\n"
