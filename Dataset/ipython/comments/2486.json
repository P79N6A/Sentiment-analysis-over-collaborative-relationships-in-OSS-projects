Not sure how to fix it yet, but for those joining us the keyboard interrupt is handled in [TerminalInteractiveShell.interact](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/frontend/terminal/interactiveshell.py#L553).\n\nAlso this might be a limitation of readline itself, as it doesn't clear the line buffer on CTRL-C and there isn't an exposed Python interface for changing the line buffer.\n"

    "body": "I don't think this is a bug in GNU readline, but a missing feature in Python's readline module.  If we could call `readline.delete_text` in the KeyboardInterrupt branch, then I think we would be set. Unfortunately, Python only exposes a tiny fraction of the readline API, and it includes none at all that let you edit the buffer.\n\nI've seen proposals to add these methods to the stdlib going back before Python 2.3, but it hasn't happened.\n"
