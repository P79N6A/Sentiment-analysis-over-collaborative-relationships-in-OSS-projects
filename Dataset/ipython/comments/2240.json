    "body": "I marked the crash tests with `@attr('crash')`, and then tweaked iptest, such that if no `-a` args are specified, then it is equivalent to `iptest -a '!crash'`.  To run the crash tests, you can do `iptest -a crash IPython.parallel`.  To run them all, I can't see a better way than `iptest -a crash -a '!crash'`, given how nose handles tag-based selection (it only seems to do selection, not exclusion).\n\nI think we can make use of tags to improve `@skip_doctest`, so that 'skipped' doctests do not show up as passing tests, as they do now, but it's not quite obvious to me precisely how.\n"
