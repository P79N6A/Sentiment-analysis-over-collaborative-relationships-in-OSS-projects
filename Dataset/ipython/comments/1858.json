    "body": "FYI, as @ellisonbg probably suspects, this patch introduced a number of focus related issues.  I'm testing an improved that works as follows:\nA method is added `notebook.prototype.focus_selected_cell()` that is called judiciously after notebook operations, alongside `Notebook.prototype.select()`.\n\nAfter each operation that modifies the notebook, the Notebook must decide 1) what to select and 2) what to focus.  So each operation (e.g. run, cut/paste, add cell, etc) a cell will be focused and selected as appropriate.  #1 could be multiple cells.  Consider typing shift-down when no cell is focused, to select two cells but focus neither.\n\nThere currently is no real infrastructure for handling clicks in either Notebook or any of the Cell classes.  CodeMirror has an onMouseDown handler, which focuses a CodeMirror element if it is clicked.  The net effect is that with my new patch, clicking anywhere except on the CodeMirror element will only select, but never focus a cell.\n\nI think handling of clicks by the Notebook and Cell should be more explicit, to enable things like multi-select and interactive plots.  So Notebook should have an onMouseDown handler that can handle multi-select, and Cell classes should also to handle self-focusing.  The latter requires that Cell inform Notebook that the cell has been focused, so that Notebook can de-focus the previously focused cell.  This introduces a dependency on Notebook for *Cell, which is something I gather from the comments that you want to avoid.  But I see no way for Notebook to decide whether a clicked cell should be focused, since the Notebook shouldn't have detailed knowledge of different cell types.  e.g. did the user click on the input area, or an interactive plot that may read keystrokes, or did he click on In[30]: or on CodeMirror's gutter?\n\nThoughts?  Maybe there's a way to avoid the dependency this using chained handlers...\n\nP.S. There's also lots of jumping associated with executing the contents of a cell that I intend to address...\n"

Thoughts?\n\nI think re-targetting for 0.14 is a good idea.\n\nThere are some nasty interactions occurring between jQuery and CodeMirror, and\nI've yet to fully disentangle that mess.  This is even responsible for some of\nthe slowness I reported in my SVG mail.\n\nI can provide a simple patch to fix the stated problem, but there are a very\nlarge number of ways that the window \"jumps\" upon focus changes, clicks, output,\netc. and I was trying to identify and fix them all.  I'd like to retarget my\nbranch for 0.14 to fix all these problems.\n\nIt's more complicated than one might expect because if you click on an output\ncell, and don't want the page to scroll up or down when you do so, you end up\nwith a focused CodeMirror textarea off-screen, which the browser doesn't like --\nso focus handing has to change.  And fixing this leads down the rabbit hole...\n"

You can look around, make experimental\nchanges and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this\nstate without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.\n\nIf you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may\ndo so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:\n\n  git checkout -b new_branch_name\n\nHEAD is now at 0928e9d... autochange highlight with cell magics\n\n$ git checkout -b saved_commit   \nSwitched to a new branch 'saved_commit'\n```\n"
