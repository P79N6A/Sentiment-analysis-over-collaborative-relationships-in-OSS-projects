    "body": "I see the same issue for EPD's distribution for Redhat Linux (6.1.1). I then installed ipython directly into that distribution (0.10) and it still failed the same way. I have older EPD distributions (e.g. on Mac OS X) for which this is not an issue. Not sure what is going on.\n\nI wonder if this is a python 2.6 issue, because my other distributions are 2.5, I believe.\n"
