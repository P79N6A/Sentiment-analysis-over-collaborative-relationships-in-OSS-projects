    "body": "We might be able to get it to work. The big diffference is that the KeyboardManager is a global thing, but the shortcuts in each cell are bound separately to each CM element. We would have to figure out a clean way of passing the cell object into the handler so the shortcuts can operate on the cell/tooltip/completer. The other issue is that the keyboard shortcuts on CodeMirror are not the same for the different cell types - all that logic would have to be special cased somehow. Something I will think about though.\n"
