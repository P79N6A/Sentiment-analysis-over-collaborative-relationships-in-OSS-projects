    "body": "I mean there are differences between tokenize module in python and python-dev builds on travis. At my first commit, the unit test failed with python3.6-dev, python3.7-dev and nightly. Looking further I found the inconsistency in which python-dev's tokenize automatically adds a NEWLINE token (before the ending DEDENTs and ENDMARKER), while normal python versions don't. The issue has also been mentioned at the top of the check_complete function in the same file (# See https://bugs.python.org/issue33899)"
