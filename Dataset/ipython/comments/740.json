Also, there's no new cell, ctrl-Enter is for executing a series of commands in one cell (e.g. ls, cd, etc. things you don't actually want to be part of the notebook).\n\nIn Chrome: ctrl-Enter executes the cell, and leaves the input selected, so typing the next command will clear it (this is the correct behavior).\nIn FF6: ctrl-Enter executes, but clears input and adds a newline, which it shouldn't.  It is essentially equivalent to the Chrome behavior followed by hitting 'Enter'.\n"
