This is useful since some commits which are now in the main repo refer to fixes by issue number which don't make sense in the context of the main repo. Having a maping of nbconvert -> main repo #s would also allow us to append the relevant low-numbered main repo issues with a link to their nbconvert namesakes, for when people are investigating specific commits and the GH #s don't make sense because of our repo merging. If we do step 1 monolithically (all in one go), then mapping from original nbconvert number to an ipython main repo number will just be a matter of a constant offset.\n> I'd like to have at least the first step done before 1.0, since that's when nbconvert will first make a public appearance.\n> \n> Does this sound like a reasonable plan?\n> \n> â€”\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n"
