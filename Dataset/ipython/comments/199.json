    "body": "Great, many thanks!  Only one minor note: don't use shlex.split, it's borked with unicode input.  Instead, use this:\n\nhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/utils/process.py#L106\n\nIt's kind of ugly that we actually have _two_ shlex.split replacements, the second one is:\n\nhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/completerlib.py#L58\n\nThat one does extra stuff to handle incomplete lines.  Use whichever you prefer, but definitely don't rely on the plain one.\n\nOther than that, this looks fantastic.  Many thanks!\n"
