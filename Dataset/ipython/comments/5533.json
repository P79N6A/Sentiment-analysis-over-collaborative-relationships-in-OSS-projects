    "body": "@takluyver - I'm reopening this for consideration based on the discussion in mathjax/MathJax#795 .  There, they basically said that it'll be a while (possibly never) before `\\AA` can be included because it's not in the default fonts with the relevant metric information.  \n\nIt, can, however, be implemented by macro to `\\unicode{x212B}`.  The mathjax folks said they don't generally do such things because it would fall back on local fonts, which may have the character, but you can't know which font of the character.  A solution they offered is having Ipython ship with the STIX fonts (which have x212B), so then it will be predictable which angstrom character comes out.  \n"

    "body": "> (possibly never)\n\nIt's not quite as bad (I hope). Ideally, the next release (after 2.4) will drop the image fonts from core MathJax at which point it's much easier to add new characters. This reduces the problem to actually having that character in the fonts -- we wouldn't mind a pull request for that.\n\nBut given the broad nature of IPython, it seems logical to ship the STIX fonts. `\\AA` could go into a custom IPython macro extension (e.g. the MediaWiki Math extension does something similar). We'd be happy to include that in our [third-party-extension repository](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-third-party-extensions), which will also be hosted on our CDN once 2.4 comes out.\n"
