I need step by step instructions because I don't know what the <fill in explicative deleted here> I am doing but just filling in a recipe.  \n\nSo, I did them out of order (by the way, the above part means that #3275 is greek to me as I barely know english).  How do I fix this?  How do I uninstall??  Then, what order do I need to install them in???\n\nThanks for your help!!!!!  \n"

But if you mix the order like performn develop and then submodule does not work. Also for me #3275 is chinese to me cannot say its Greek as I am greek that will mean i get it, you see.

The only thing that matters is that `submodule` comes before `install`, because nothing you do after `install` has any effect on anything until you do `install` again. And as for @pvlastaridis suggestion - this is fine, as long as you remove the first `install` - it makes no sense to `install` and then do `develop`.\n"
