Otherwise, the easiest way to figure it out is to download the notebook, open it, and then click the cell to unrender it. (Although this does suggest that it would be handy in nbviewer that one could mouse-over or click a cell to see the Markdown source). That would make a nice tool for beginners to see how to create Markdown and equations.\n"
