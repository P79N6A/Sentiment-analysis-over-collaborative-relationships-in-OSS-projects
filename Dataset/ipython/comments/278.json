    "body": "I'm inclined to switch to ~/.config/ipython for all new users.  Might as well start following standards :)\n\nBut before we merge, the policy should be documented: the docs describe ~/.ipython in a lot of places, so the new policy should be explained.\n\nAnd for now, I'd stick to just one dir, ignoring the XDG guidelines for multiple dirs.  Let's get the basic part working first, but with our design of one ipython dir and subdirectories below it.  If we read the full basedir spec (http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) and were to follow it all, we might need to have logic for DATA_DIRS, CACHE_HOME and RUNTIME_DIR.  That's more complexity than I want to mess with now, especially since we haven't even finalized how much we want to serialize and where we want it. Those decisions are easier to make if we just have one location to think about instead of 4 different things.\n"
