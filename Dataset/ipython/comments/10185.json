I don't think we can just set  a Python signal handler and leave it, because a Python signal handler won't break out of compiled code which the user may have called.\r\n\r\nJeroen has implemented the machinery in Cysignals to restore OS-level signal handlers from Python, but we don't want a compiled dependency in IPython. And there doesn't seem to be much interest in getting that functionality into the Python `signal` module - though there isn't antipathy either, so maybe if someone made a pull request it might go somewhere.\r\n\r\nClosing this for now, anyway."
