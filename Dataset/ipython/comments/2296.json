    "body": "Hi,\n\nBase project URL is the URL that the iPython server uses to serve a\nnotebook manager UI. In my case, I am using a notebook manager UI that is\nnot part of the core iPython code, and not served by iPython server. So\nwhen I set my notebook manager URL to say A, and notebook manager class to\nsay B, then the default python manager UI from iPython uses B to list\nnotebooks, etc, but at a different URL A (in my case served by Django), I\nsee a different UI with notebook searching, tagging, etc.\n\nI think at least at this point, it seems perfectly reasonable to support\nabstracting out the manager UI out of iPython core.\n\nShould definitely be reflected in File > Open. Thanks! I will update my\nbranch.\n\nBenjie\n\nOn Mon, Aug 13, 2012 at 11:21 AM, Bussonnier Matthias <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> couldn't you do what you ask with base_project_url?

It make sense to have \"new\", \"open\", \"copy\" all go to the same baseProjectUrl, rather than just changing the behavior of \"open\".\n\nBasically, my alternative notebook manager UI leverages the existing iPython notebook manager HTTP interface to create, copy, rename notebooks, but just list notebooks differently. \n\nI updated my branch accordingly.\n"

Eventually we want single sign on anyways, if we do end up with two\nservers.\n\nRegarding \"serving from /\" -- this is an interesting thought. What if we\ndelegate more to the manager? Right now we handle URLs in handler.py and\ncall routines in notebook manager, but what if we put in more UI\nfunctionality in the notebook manager as well? E.g. routing of URLs,\nloading templates, etc.\n\nIn that case, we can add a manager that serves the default dashboard UI,\nand current file system based manager and azure manager can subclass that,\nand I can create a separate notebook manager all together.\n\nThen I can serve URLs, from the same iPython server, that are just\napplicable for my UI. E.g. API for accessing tags, archives, etc. And my JS\ncode can use those APIs.\n\nLooking at the URL list in notebookapp.py, I think it makes sense to\ndelegate anything dealing with notebooks to the notebook manager, leaving\ncluster and kernel management as is.\n\nThoughts?\n\nBenjie\n\nOn Mon, Aug 13, 2012 at 12:34 PM, Bussonnier Matthias <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Thinking about it,\n> If there is 2 servers, wouldn't authentication be broken in the sens that\n> you would have to login twice ?\n> \n> I haven't looked at the ability to change backend, but maybe there is a\n> way to serve your pages from '/'.\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/2296#issuecomment-7697427.\n"

    "body": "If this does go in, then I think that redirects are the way to do it.  But I am not sure that this makes sense at this point.  A few points:\n- The internal structure of the notebook server that you are modifying is very much a moving target.  More specifically, we have plans that would completely refactor all of it in the next 6-12 months.  In light of this, I don't want to expose things to developers like yourself and be committed to maintaining them.\n- We want the notebook to be extensible, but in a very different manner than this.  My idea is to break up the html/js/css/handlers into reusable components that people like yourself can assemble in different ways.  Each of those components will have well supported, official dev APIs for customizations.  But in this new model, customization will be done by writing custom main applications that assemble the pieces in the desired manner.  In fact, IPython itself may end up having multiple top level notebook server scripts for different purposes.  I would much rather make it easy for people like yourself to write the top level scripts than to try to have one script with a million different configuration options to try and please everyone.\n\nOn more practical notes:\n- From a technical standpoint, I don't see why you are trying to run django in a separate process.  Do you have an existing app you are integrating with?  Why not just write everything using sqlalchemy and tornado?\n- We are wanting to move the notebook in this direction, although we are thinking of using git for version control.  I would much rather have discussions to see if we could design a more general UI that can support different notebook managers. Would you be interested in working with us on these things?\n"

    "body": "@ellisonbg I do have another django based app that I am integrating with, but I think it's much better if I first forget about that integration and just get the iPython part right.\n\n@Carreau @ellisonbg What do you guys think of a new effort in the following commit:\n\nhttps://github.com/benjiec/ipython/commit/7b86380a369b6b7235b433bf6da4b14e7b1f2ec2\n\nThis is not part of this PR, but I thinking over the above comments, I decided that it may be better for me to take a less divergent approach. Instead of a complete different backend to store notebooks and separate server to handle dashboard UI, I extended the list_notebooks method of notebook manager and the NotebookRootHandler to allow sorting and querying/filtering. I hope this effort at least would be useful for you, and be easier to maintain if you do decide to take it.\n\nThis commit lets notebook manager optionally handle ordering and filtering. Notebook manager can also pass extra information to the UI. E.g. I extended file based nb manager to also include a mtime that the UI displays. And if the UI asks for sorting by mtime, then file based nb manager handles it. The UI also includes a widget to search notebooks by name.\n\nIt may still be useful to abstract out the JS code to be manager specific? E.g. right now the JS code handles when backend does not pass it mtime, but displays a mtime column anyways. So it's clearly backend specific. That may be okay, though, if there may be some consensus on what the frontend should look like, or at least what the default frontend should look like. This may be closer to what you are thinking about.\n\nFor myself, I plan on a simple subclass of file based notebook manager to just create converted notebooks on each save for archiving for now, and stuff them in a directory or in a git repo.\n\nSorry, I have obviously not thought about all this as much as you have. I'd love to help in some way; we are developing an app that I want to use iPython notebook significantly, with many users and many notebooks. The UI side of the notebook manager is just one thing, but we are also interested in interface between iPython and the browser, for SVG visualization stuff.\n"

I hope this effort at least would be useful for you,\n> and be easier to maintain if you do decide to take it.\n> \n> This commit lets notebook manager optionally handle ordering and\n> filtering. Notebook manager can also pass extra information to the UI. E.g.\n> I extended file based nb manager to also include a mtime that the UI\n> displays. And if the UI asks for sorting by mtime, then file based nb\n> manager handles it. The UI also includes a widget to search notebooks by\n> name.\n> \n> It may still be useful to abstract out the JS code to be manager specific?\n> E.g. right now the JS code handles when backend does not pass it mtime, but\n> displays a mtime column anyways. So it's clearly backend specific. That may\n> be okay, though, if there may be some consensus on what the frontend should\n> look like, or at least what the default frontend should look like. This may\n> be closer to what you are thinking about.\n> \n> For myself, I plan on a simple subclass of file based notebook manager to\n> just create converted notebooks on each save for archiving for now, and\n> stuff them in a directory or in a git repo.\n> \n> Sorry, I have obviously not thought about all this as much as you have.\n> I'd love to help in some way; we are developing an app that I want to use\n> iPython notebook significantly, with many users and many notebooks. The UI\n> side of the notebook manager is just one thing, but we are also interested\n> in interface between iPython and the browser, for SVG visualization stuff.\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/2296#issuecomment-7716527.\n\n## \n\nBrian E.
