    "body": "Yup, I, at least tried, it is doable:\n    http://carreau.github.io/posts/05-YAML%20Notebook.html\n\nHaving json mean that we can compare the data structure we are using with what is in memory, and a space error in modifying a json file, will most likely raise an error than introduce a bad weird format hard to debug which can happend in yaml/.\n\nYAML also suffer from \"security feature\" where you might be tempted to serialize an object in the store, which depends on the implementation (easy to slip), and json support across languages is more robust.\nWe ( by which I mean I) don't trust people to use `safe_load` and library author to make `load` == `safe_load` by default.\n\nI know that yaml as some other advantages, like streaming and alike that might be usefull too,\nbut for know I think that the cost of yaml would be too high for interoperability vs the benefits.\n\nThough we have pluggable backend, so you could do a yaml/reader writer, which woudl be nice to develop.\n\nI'm going to close because there is nothing to \"fix\", but we can continue the discussion if you like.\n"

    "body": "Thanks for the quick comments.\n\nCouple of quick followups:\n- I wasn't suggesting new serialization capabilities (eg. object serialization), but rather just a different syntax for the same JSON data model. So I'd expect that to not result in new security surface area from new serialization approaches.\n- Reading notebooks as plain text - I tend to think of this as quite interesting/mainline, certainly not fringe... conversion tools are fine if they're meant to be a one-way thing, but in scenarios like diff, you don't want to diff some derived output, but rather the notebook itself, if that is what you're committing in a changelist. I hear you that there is a bunch of metadata, but I think there is a lot more syntax noise, which would be eliminated with a more readable format.\n\nSome of this is indeed opinion. I was curious about prior thought on this, so once again, thanks for the responses.\n"
