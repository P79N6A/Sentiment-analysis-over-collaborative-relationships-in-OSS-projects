    "body": "This behavior is expected.  When the notebook cells are executed the last expression in the cell is sent to be displayed.  For example, the following will not write to the console because of the trailing semi colon:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom IPython.display import Javascript\r\nJavascript(\"console.log('foo')\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you import the code as module you must explicitly call `display` to show rich display objects.\r\n\r\nIn the notebook, the cell display behavior is configurable with [`ast_node_interactivity`](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/options/terminal.html#configtrait-InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity)."
