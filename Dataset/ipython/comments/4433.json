    "body": "Ubuntu 11.04. I've compiled Python-3.3.2 from sources with bz2 compressor. The only thing i've changed was `if (self.compiler.find_library_file(['/home/user/packages/libbz2/lib'], 'bz2')):  # lib_dirs, 'bz2')):` in setup.py -- just showed him where my bz2 is. Then make && make -f Makefile-libbz2_so && make install. After that I could untar bz2 files using pip. With this configuration IPython was monochrome. And also another guy I work with also noticed that Up arrow does not show last command. Instead prints ^D ^A and so on. What is this `readline`? Did I do something wrong?\n"

When you compile Python yourself, it's easy to get an incomplete standard library, and have various broken aspects of Python that are not immediately apparent.  Try making sure that the readline headers are available at compile time (probably `apt-get install readline-dev` or similar).\n"
