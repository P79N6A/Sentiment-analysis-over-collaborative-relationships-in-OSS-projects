    "body": "Added some commits to address your notes, as well as bookkeeping like updating man page source and allowing `--gui=gevent` from the command line.  Wasn't sure what to do about the `--pylab` options which seem similar in choosing gui modes.\n\nThis is still not 100% perfect - when you import something that gevent has monkeypatched, you'll get an error: `The history saving thread hit an unexpected error (NotImplementedError('gevent is only usable from a single thread',)).History will not be written to the database.`\n\nI suspect this is due to the gui hook being loaded later on after it has imported modules already that gevent needs to monkeypatch to get working properly.  I'm not sure the best approach around this.  In our project, we use embedded IPython, so we've already monkeypatched long before IPython's modules get imported, but certainly is not the case here.  Hoping someone else has a suggestion.\n"

It's not code that I'm closely familiar with either, but it looks like the Application initialises the Shell (which in turn initialises the history) before it deals with the GUI integration.\n\nI _think_ the GUI integration doesn't actually require the shell object, so it might be possible to split `InteractiveShellApp.init_gui_pylab` into two methods, so the gui integration runs before the shell is created, and the pylab integration runs after. Hopefully someone who's more familiar with this can confirm that.\n"

The history thread is started by the `HistoryManager`, in [`init_history`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py#L1516-L1519), called by [`InteractiveShell.__init__`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py#L451).\n\nThe `HistoryManager.__init__` [starts the thread](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/history.py#L469-L470).\n\nThis is far too early in the process, at least from my rudimentary printf-debugging.  Configuration from the command line hasn't even been considered yet, so we've had no point in which to do our monkey patching before a thread has already been started.\n\nIs there a possibility we could move this thread init/start to be later in the sequence?  Some point before an interactive shell is actually started/shown (instead of initialized)?  That would solve one of the hurdles.\n"

I'm sorry I'm not able to figure out a better spot to do the gevent monkeypatch that is required before anything happens like starting the history thread for instance.  The obvious but also dirty feeling solution would be, in the `InteractiveShell.__init__` method, check the config for `--gui` and special case it.  Feels wrong.  Could also introduce some sort of \"pre-gui\" hook concept into the whole chain there which is slightly better but still feels a bit out of place.\n"
