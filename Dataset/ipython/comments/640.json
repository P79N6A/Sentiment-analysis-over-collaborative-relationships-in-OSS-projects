    "body": "@claumann it makes sense that the behavior is the same between the qtconsole and notebook, as they use the same kernel code (where all the real execution happens).\n\nI typically use matplotlib trunk, which is generally better behaved (much less crashy with the osx backend), but I just installed the 1.0.1 egg from sourceforge, and it still behaves just fine, so I'm baffled.  At some point, I will try installing EPD, and see if it behaves any differently.  You might try getting the eggs from the [scipy superpack](http://stronginference.com/scipy-superpack/), and see if they don't work better.\n\nSo: System Python (2.7 on Lion and 2.6 on SL)  + git numpy + matplotlib (1.0.1 or trunk) definitely work fine here.\n"

    "body": "I've looked into this a bit, and it does seem to be unique to EPD.  It at least does not affect System Python, and shouldn't affect any official Python.org distros, but it will affect any Python that is built against non-native libtk (could include macports).\n\nI had forgotten that selecting the OSX backend uses the Tk version of the kernel in order to get the zmq polling integrated with the backend eventloop.  Using Tk works fine with the system Python because the system Tk is native Cocoa, so the CFRunLoop (the native eventloop) that the osx backend hooks into _is_ that of the Tk app, and events are processed properly.  However, EPD's Tk is bizarrely linked against X11 instead of native libraries, so it _doesn't_ advance the CFRunLoop.  This explains why the behavior in EPD is the same as if the backend eventloop is not hooked up - it isn't.   \n\nI certainly don't blame EPD for shipping their own Tk - the system one is notoriously a mess - but that is the root cause of this issue.\n\nSo, essentially we need to figure out a different way to get the CFRunLoop going without using Tk, since Tk can't be assumed to be using the native toolkit.\n\nAny matplotlib and/or Mac folks have clever ideas for how to integrate with the native eventloop when stdin doesn't exist?\n"
