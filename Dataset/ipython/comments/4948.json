We can not support all the themes because it would imply touching the reveal.js source code... that we are only using as an external library.\n\nI have detailed an example customization in a blog post here: http://www.damian.oquanta.info/posts/customizing-your-ipython-slides.html\n\nSo, I think there is enough info and we can close this one, but we can wait for @keflavich opinion if you want...\n"
