    "body": "PR #757 tells if user specifies his/her own color scheme by looking at the `py-python-command-args` as my patch does. That's correct. But if user follows the the new syntax, it won't work as expect. Because:\n\n``` lisp\n(member \"--colors\" py-python-command-args)\n```\n\nfails to match `--colors=LightBG`. while my patch matches the arguments with `(string-match \"^--colors=*\" x)` where `string-match` matches the elements in the argument list with a regular expression of `^--color=*` . That's the right way to go, IMHO.\n\nOther than this, we are basically the same. And I am sending PR #765 in which I replace all tab with four spaces.\n"
