Bizarrely, I think the answer is: there isn't one.  Nor for require.js, or many other javascript things.  A document containing each function, together with its arguments and consequences, would be Very Awesome.)\n\nBut the answer you're looking for is:\n\n```\nrequire([\"widgets/js/widget\", \"widgets/js/manager\"], function(widget, manager){\n\nvar HelloView = widget.DOMWidgetView.extend({\n\n    // Render the view.\n    render: function(){ \n        this.$el.text('Hello World!'); \n    },\n});\n\nmanager.WidgetManager.register_widget_view('HelloView', HelloView);\n});\n```\n"
