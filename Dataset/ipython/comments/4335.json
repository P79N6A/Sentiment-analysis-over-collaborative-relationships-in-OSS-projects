    "body": "The warning could be related to #2035 and the fact that sympy 0.7.2 is installed. Sympy is imported due to the skip if not sympy decorator and importing sympy selects a backend due to the ploting module breaking the selection of backend in the testss However this should be fixed in sympy 0.7.3. Other package imports may have a similar effect. \n"
