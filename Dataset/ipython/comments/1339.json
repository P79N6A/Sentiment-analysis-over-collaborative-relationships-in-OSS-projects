Print view works again =), and \"save as web page complete\" and \"print to pdf\" from Firefox both work.\n\nMinor issues :\n- Less-than and greater-than symbols are being double escaped (e.g., to &amp;lt; instead of &lt;) (_c.f._ markdown source for what I mean)\n- Code cells still have cursors and can be edited/run (I think this is intentional)\n\nSo, printing is totally usable as of this commit.  Thanks!\n"

The print view does remain editable which at some point I think it wasn't, but you've mentioned there was some refactoring needed re. the read-only use, so we can revisit that point later if it works best that way.\n\nI think having the print view be read-only is a valid enhancement request, but not really a bug, so as far as I'm concerned this is fixed.\n"
