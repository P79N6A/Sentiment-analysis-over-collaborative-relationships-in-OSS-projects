I'm also not looking at types in the  signature. I'm looking at something that has as little false negative. Focusing for now on non intentional change of function signature (I catched a few in matplotlib 1.5->2.0 but it's too late now). And also something that can give me a list of change to review. \r\n\r\nA change can easily sneak through multiple PRs, as you may think a change had not been released yet and bring modification to APIs where you should not.\r\n\r\nIt does not of course remove work from the reviewer (I don't want to be without a job ðŸ˜„  )"
