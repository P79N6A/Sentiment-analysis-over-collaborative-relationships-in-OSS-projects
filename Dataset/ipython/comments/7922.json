I try to run notebook continously and install the package it fails importing until it runs. I got confused because it failed on a pyzmq import but I had installed it on virtualenv.\nTo fix it I also installed ipython from package repo.\n\nThere still might be bug because maybe it uses the system version when it should use virtualenv one.\n\npyzmq imports just fine.\n"
