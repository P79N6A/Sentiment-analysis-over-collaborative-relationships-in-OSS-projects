    "body": "I actually think we could get rid of `git mpr` and use [those instructions](https://gist.github.com/piscisaureus/3342247).\n\nYou can even push it a little further and tweek your .git/config (global or local) to have a shortcut for both the HEAD and MERGE commit if the PR is mergeable. And it is actually much more usefull than `mpr` because you can do all sort of things like `diff master origin/pr/2543` or directly a checkout, or a rebase... etc.\n"
