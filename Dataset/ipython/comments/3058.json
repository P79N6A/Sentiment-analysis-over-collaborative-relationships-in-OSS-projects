    "body": "> - How do you reference a notebook in a sub dir/parent dir?\n\nWe are going to need to figure out what the URL scheme looks like for notebooks elsewhere before we can think about this.  We may want another special redirect that can take more information, but the important thing here is that a relative link to an adjacent notebook resolves.\n\n> Also, would it be more consistent to put these under the \"files\" handler.\n\nIt would not.  a files url is strictly for serving static files - a link to a live notebook is decidedly not serving a static file. Specifically, requesting `files/Notebook Name.ipynb` always has worked, but this results in _downloading_ the notebook file (as it should, being served as a static file), not loading the file in an active notebook.\n\nWhat should work, given what we have now:\n- linking to an adjacent notebook with simple _relative_ `notebook.ipynb` URL.\n\nWhat may need more work (or may never work, depending how we do things):\n- linking to notebooks in other directories\n\nBut we can't begin to think about this one until we have our url scheme for notebooks in other directories.\nOne thing that may change is that notebooks get `/`, such that starting from notebook U-U-I-D\n\nright now:\n\nlink `Notebook.ipynb` on page `/root/U-U-I-D` resolves to `/root/Notebook.ipynb`.  If we end up going with simple UUID urls for notebooks even after we have multiple directory support, it may make more sense for the notebook URLs to have trailing slash, so a single notebook would be `/root/U-U-I-D/`, in which case the relative `Notebook.ipynb` url would instead resolve to `/root/U-U-I-D/Notebook.ipynb`, which we would then have to interpret as \"Notebook.ipynb that is adjacent to notebook with id U-U-I-D\".  In either case, the link scheme is the same - as long as people stick to relative URLs.\n\nIf we end up with per-directory project UUIDs, such that each notebook would have a url like `/root/projectUUID/nbUUID`, then there's no problem again, because it is unambiguous which project where the notebook resides.  For linking across projects, we may need to add another redirect for 'project-by-name', just like this one for notebook-by-name.  In all of these cases so far, the redirect does not need to change.\n"
