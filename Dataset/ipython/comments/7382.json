I think we do want to minimize our usage of large shaded areas on the page. So not sure about the grey one.\n\nFor the green one, I think we would need to pick a very subtle treatment. The stronger colors are just too much on the eye. I think the `#ded` version is in the right direction and definitely gives more emphasis to edit mode.\n\nHonestly, this is exactly the type of design work though that is best when two people can sit down in person and try different things in real time. @jdfreder and I could do that next Wed.\n\nAdding to the dev meeting for next week to get other ideas.\n"
