It's unfortunately not clear why it does that, but we know that's very delicate code, so I don't want to rip it out until we have a good idea why it's there. I suspect it's something to do with the fact that module names are normally meant to be unique, and having multiple modules around thinking that they're `__main__` could cause problems.\n\nNote that the warning is just a warning, not an error. Embedding still appears to work despite it.\n"
