And I'd rather not start a ChangeLog again (we used to have one), since now our release process instead generates its equivalent out of the github PR and issue list.\n\nBut, iterating on this idea: how about instead we add  a short section on this topic at the end of the main README.md?  This is likely important enough to warrant mention there for a while to come, and that would mean it's available to the users always right next to them (if they are installing from source, by definition they have the README.md).\n\nSo, we could keep the short & sweet error message as per @willingc's suggestion in the code, and a bit more info at the end of the README.\n\nThat would, I think, satisfy the constraints, obviate the need for managing a separate URL, and pick up on the Changelog idea without the issues that specific kind of file brings up.\n\nThoughts?\n"
