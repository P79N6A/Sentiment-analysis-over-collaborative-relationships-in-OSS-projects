    "body": "Complete implementation of interactive traceback support.\n\nEver since IPython started, we've had no proper tracebacks for\ninteractively entered code.  The terminal version was fairly\nuncomfortable for more than just a few lines of code, so this was\nnever too big of a deal.  But the new architecture allows clients with\ncomplex multiline input, and having proper tracebacks becomes now\ncritical for real-world use.\n\nThanks to Robert Kern for key implementation ideas and original patch.\n\nClosed by c94126c20b9b761f78a574eb4dcacc04f164b398.\n"
