    "body": "For widgets that use execute on browser-side change events, this PR will mean that execute requests queued on the kernel are lost.  If a user keeps making changes to a widget before the queue is emptied, nothing will ever show up in the output area.  That will be extremely confusing to users who will keep moving the UI controls trying to get something to show up - which itself will only prolong the problem.  I understand why we need to fix this, but I am wondering if we can use an approach that is a little more liberal about this behavior.\n"

This only affects the previous call to `cell.execute`, not the previous call to `kernel.execute`.  I should hope that widgets do not actually call `cell.execute`.\n"
