For example, if usability testing shows that 90% of users prefer \"keep\" for the indentation mode, then we will use that, even if 10% of users don't like it.  But, in things like this, we will eventually have a config section that allows advanced (or annoyed) users to adjust things to their liking.\n\nIn spite of all of this, I do think that \"keep\" is probably a good default if we can fix the backspace bug.  But until then, I think we should leave it as is.\n\nOne last important point on this.  We (developers) tend to be _horrible_ judges in areas like this because we are not \"typical\" users.  I am guilty of this as much as any of us.\n"
