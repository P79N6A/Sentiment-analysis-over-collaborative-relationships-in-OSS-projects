    "body": "This is one of those things where whichever way it works, someone's always unhappy. The rationale behind using separate lines is that the terminal is a poor multiline editor, so getting a block of lines is just awkward (and the indentation looks off, because we can't put the `...:` prefixes before each line). A config option isn't a bad idea, but hopefully it will be less of an issue as more people start using the Qt console.\n"
