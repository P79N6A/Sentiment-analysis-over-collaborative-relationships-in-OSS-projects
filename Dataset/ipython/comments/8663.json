I'd also like to see specific deprecation warnings in IPython 4 if there are big changes coming in 5 instead of this broad warning. The changes made in the widgets API for version 3 caused us lots of headaches and it isn't clear why changing css, etc on widgets are now done with private attrs/methods. I can understand that you all want to clean things up but the current warning seems to tell developers that you all don't care that we have lots of code depending on the widgets API from IPython 2 and 3. I'm just dreading our app breaking on install of future IPython versions with no specific warnings in the previous versions.\n"
