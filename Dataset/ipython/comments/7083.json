    "body": "Ah, I missed that you were pulling the webapp off the nbapp rather than getting it directly.  \n\nFor what it's worth, it seems like there's a more pressing need to be able to configure the Tornado server than there is to configure the IPython app (partly because the app is already a Configurable, and partly because most of the user-facing options on the IPython app are actually forwarded to the Tornado app).  My guess is that a pretty common pattern will be to do what you're doing in the example and pull the Tornado app off the nbapp immediately muck with it instead.  I guess this is strictly more general, which may or may not be a benefit if you're concerned about pandora's boxing.\n"

    "body": "You can already use require to load css and other file types from nbextensions. You do not need yet another static handler for that.\n\nEnvoyé de mon iPhone\n\n> Le 3 déc. 2014 à 00:57, Thomas Kluyver notifications@github.com a écrit :\n> \n> As some people may be tiring of my pointing out, it seems strange that we have extension points for the JS and the kernel, but none for the notebook server.\n> \n> For cite2c, I want to add a handler which can serve a directory of style files for use by the nbextension part. With this PR, the extension for that looks like this:\n> \n> from IPython.html.utils import url_path_join as ujoin\n> from tornado.web import StaticFileHandler\n> \n> def load_jupyter_server_extension(nbapp):\n>     webapp = nbapp.web_app\n>     base_url = webapp.settings['base_url']\n>     webapp.add_handlers(\"._$\", [\n>         (ujoin(base_url, r\"/cite2c/styles/(._)\"), StaticFileHandler, {'path': '...'})\n>     ])\n> Like our other extension APIs, the extension may define a single function, here load_jupyter_server_extension(), which we will call with a reference to the notebookapplication object. From that object you can access just about anything else of interest in the notebook application.\n> \n> If adding handlers is a common use case, we may want to add a convenience method that does so correctly, taking account of base_url.\n> \n> You can merge this Pull Request by running\n> \n>   git pull https://github.com/takluyver/ipython server-extensions\n> Or view, comment on, or merge it at:\n> \n>   https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/7083\n> \n> Commit Summary\n> \n> Add support for notebook server extensions\n> File Changes\n> \n> M IPython/html/notebookapp.py (23)\n> Patch Links:\n> \n> https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/7083.patch\n> https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/7083.diff\n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n"
