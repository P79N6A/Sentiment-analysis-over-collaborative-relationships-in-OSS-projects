    "body": "The main issues, as far as I can tell:\n- you should probably clear output _before_ drawing the latest edition, otherwise you are drawing output, then immediately clearing it. `\\r` is non-destructive, but clear_output blanks the output immediately.\n- make sure you call `sys.stdout.flush()`, to push events to the frontend, otherwise they will all fire together at the end of execution.\n- `import IPython` does _not_ imply `import IPython.core.display`, so your code always gives `IPython=None`.\n- I don't know why you would _not_ use `\\r` on non-Windows, because it seems to work perfectly well.\n\nThis seems to work just fine in the notebook, qtconsole, and terminal IPython:\n\n``` python\nimport sys, time\ntry:\n    from IPython.core.display import clear_output\n    have_ipython = True\nexcept ImportError:\n    have_ipython = False\n\nclass ProgressBar:\n    def __init__(self, iterations):\n        self.iterations = iterations\n        self.prog_bar = '[]'\n        self.fill_char = '*'\n        self.width = 40\n        self.__update_amount(0)\n        if have_ipython:\n            self.animate = self.animate_ipython\n        else:\n            self.animate = self.animate_noipython\n\n    def animate_ipython(self, iter):\n        try:\n            clear_output()\n        except Exception:\n            # terminal IPython has no clear_output\n            pass\n        print '\\r', self,\n        sys.stdout.flush()\n        self.update_iteration(iter + 1)\n\n    ...\n```\n"

    "body": "Thanks, that is an improvement, but it still does not seem to work. For some reason, the problem arises when animate() is called externally. For example, even if I ignore my PyMC code altogether and call the ProgressBar's `animate` method from a simple function, it does not work -- it displays nothing until the last iteration, when it dumps everything to the screen:\n\n![bad progress bar](http://f.cl.ly/items/0l140g2N2N142I1s0V3w/Screen%20Shot%202012-03-26%20at%205.46.19%20PM.png)\n\nHowever, if I add a `run()` method to the ProgressBar class itself:\n\n```\ndef run(self):\n    for i in range(1000):\n        self.animate(i)\n```\n\nit works ... any reason why this should be?\n"

I gather that I'm supposed to let IPython notebook choose what to display by using http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/github.com/ipython/ipython/raw/master/examples/notebooks/Part%205%20-%20Rich%20Display%20System.ipynb .
