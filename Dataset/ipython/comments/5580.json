I indeed removed python 3 (completely, I thought) before re-installing, with brew, but all the /usr/local/lib/python3.3/site-packages are still hanging around, and that version indeed installed the `/usr/local/bin/ipython3`:\n\n```\nfrl$ cat /usr/local/bin/ipython3\n#!/usr/local/opt/python3/bin/python3.3\n# EASY-INSTALL-ENTRY-SCRIPT: 'ipython==1.1.0','console_scripts','ipython3'\n__requires__ = 'ipython==1.1.0'\n... etc.\n```\n\nSo, looks like uninstalling and re-installing ipython with\n\n```\npip3 uninstall ipython\npip3 install ipython\n```\n\nwill not overwrite the ipython3 exec `/usr/local/bin/ipython3`\n\nI deleted it manually, and re-installed ipython again, now it all works.\nThanks again!\n"
