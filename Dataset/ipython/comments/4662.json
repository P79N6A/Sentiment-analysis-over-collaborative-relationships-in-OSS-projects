    "body": "Thanks for the feedback. Here is my modified thoughts:\n- Removing the \"Kernel\" menu entirely will likely confuse users. I am +0.8 on putting it back.\n- I am still +0 on putting the cell type items in the \"Cell\" menu, but don't feel strongly about it. I would, however, prefer to put it into a submenu. Thoughts?\n- I am -1 on including select next/prev in the \"Edit\" menu. These are equivalent to the up/down arrow keys and I have never seen another app put simple navigation like this in a menu. Also cell selection is completely equivalent to simply clicking on a cell. Requiring two clicks (click on \"Edit\" menu and then on \"Select Next\") instead of just one (just click on the cell!) is complete silliness.\n- Another thing that I don't think we should put into a menu - UI for switching between command/edit mode. I think this falls under the basic navigation category. This is not to mention that it won't work because clicking in the menu always puts the notebook into command mode.\n"
