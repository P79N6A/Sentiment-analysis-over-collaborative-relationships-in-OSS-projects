This PR only modify things inside the slide as a unit.\n\n> So long as this doesn't risk breaking existing slides, we're happy to merge it (from dev meeting).\n\nI will not break them, at least, AFAIK... \nIn fact, this PR introduce the notebook linearity inside the slides, because right now, a \"-\" cell could \"appear\" (be visualized) before a fragment cell located upstream of this \"-\" cell... with this PR, it is ensured that the \"-\" cells appear with the fragment, at the same time... avoiding the \"linearity\" break.\nSo, in conclusion, if someone render again his/her slides with this PR, s/he will see the same except for the fact that \"-\" cell are \"visualized\" with previous fragment cells, if there is a fragment cell before the \"-\" (if not, there is not change in the behaviour at all).\nMaybe I need to record a video to show the difference... let me know if you need them... I have no problem to do it, just a few minutes...\n"
