We should probably ping Enthought to ask them to make their readline identifiable in some manner though, I'm sure they could just add a flag to their module to allow us to recognize it.\n\nI haven't run the code myself, but given your OSX expertise and how much you've dealt with this issue, I'm OK if you want to merge once the above tiny things are fixed.  Though if you want a second pair of OSX-specific eyes, that's OK too.\n"

    "body": "I do worry about mucking with the path, but I was helping someone out today, explaining why pip doesn't work, and they asked if I could just instruct Python to ignore the system one, allowing the site-packages to be searched for readline, and I realized it actually is possible.  I tested it, and it certainly does work - pip-installed readline will be found by IPython, at least with System Python and EPD on my machine.\n\nI honestly don't know why EPD and/or fink readline are broken - we should ask Ilan, or someone. Just this week, I have had people with EPD at py4science and Fink (in #915) report weird readline behavior (not the same), and both found that their respective weirdnesses were resolved by `easy_install readline`.  If it is that they are linked against libedit (fink is _not_, but EPD might be) and just not reporting it, that would make sense, and it is a bug that their `readline.__doc__` is wrong.  But I don't know what the default behavior is, when you build Python and readline is not present.\n"
