Either way, I'll get used to it, I'm sure.\n"

The implementation would need to keep C-D as delete if there's text on the line and only issue EOF if done on an empty line (like the readline-based console works).\n\nBut as long as it's configurable, I could see people wanting it.  Evan's been great at refining the console as people point out little rough edges, see #356 for a good example.\n"
