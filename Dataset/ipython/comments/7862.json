Is it simply a matter of not being able to maintain all the different components? If so, the project is going to grow either way, and this approach of only maintaining the core will leave behind a lot of the functionality. That is just my personal opinion, and I would like to hear yours.\n\nI would certainly appreciate any help with making it standalone if that's the way it has to go, as I don't have any clue on where to begin and what the framework is for ipython standalone extensions. How do people discover what packages are currently out there?\n"

    "body": "We write these APIs and make them configurable specifically to allow people to develop these ideas outside IPython, without the massive inertia associated with being part of IPython itself. When we add functionality to IPython, we are committing to supporting it indefinitely. There is a high cost to that. Making extension points that others can use to provide their own functionality allows experimental ideas such as this to move at their own pace, which is likely very much out of sync from the IPython release cycle. If they are generically useful and popular, it may be merged into IPython itself in the future, but that's not where it should start.\n\nA great example of this is the [ExecutePreProcessor](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/3.x/IPython/nbconvert/preprocessors/execute.py), which began as a simple [demo script](https://gist.github.com/minrk/2620876), was picked up as [runipy](https://github.com/paulgb/runipy), and ultimately landed in IPython.\n\n> I would certainly appreciate any help with making it standalone if that's the way it has to go\n\nSure, we'd be happy to help. You may want to look at these other examples of custom storage implementations:\n- [pgcontents](https://github.com/quantopian/pgcontents) stores notebooks and checkpoints in postgres.\n- [nbx](https://github.com/dalejung/nbx) does its own treatment of the filesystem and has some integration with GitHub\n\nThe main thing to do is create a Python package that contains your class and upload it to PyPI. This could be a single python module plus a small setup.py for installation. Then people can install your class, and enable it via `ipython_notebook_config.py`:\n\n```\nc.FileContentsManager.checkpoints_class = 'yourmodule.GitCheckpoints'\n```\n"
