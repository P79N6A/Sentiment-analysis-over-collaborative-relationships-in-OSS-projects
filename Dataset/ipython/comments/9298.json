Given that the name of that module carries a dot in it, it's really confusing: I spent some time tracking down the problem down to this PR (much like @Achifaifa), before realizing that I wasn't missing some module called `backports`, but instead that someone literally decided to name a package with a dot in it!!  \n\nI guess there's nothing we can do about that (I think it's unnecessarily confusing to users, imagine if people start making lots of top-level packages with dots in their names, the fun we're going to have tracking down import errors).  But at least we can mitigate it via a message, given this is such a special case.\n\nJust my 2 cents...\n"

    "body": "Yep, it's only an issue for people updating from git - anyone installing a released version, or even installing afresh from git, will get it automatically.\n\nWe've been down the road of trying to add better error messages before (with jsonschema), and it later ended up obscuring a problem with jsonschema's dependency specifications, because there was an `ImportError` coming from some other package. I don't think we should try to be clever with this - having to deal with new dependencies occasionally is an occupational hazard of living on master. Maybe we should ping them mailing list to let people know what they need to install, but I don't think it needs changes to the code itself.\n"

    "body": "Yes, I can see the problem with potentially masking other errors.  That could be mitigated by simply adding the info message without blocking the traceback, so the full original traceback is always visible, only with a catch message:\n\n``` python\ntry:\n  import foo\nexcept ImportError:\n  warn(\"you seem to be missing new dependency foo, see http://url/to/foo to get it\")\n  raise\n```\n\nBut I'm not going to push it :) At least, a little PSA-style announcement on-list when new dependencies arise would be a good idea.  That way, at least the devs who work off master get a heads-up.  In my case, what happened was that I did a git pull but didn't re-run right away, and only noticed the problem on a plane without internet :)  I knew what to do, the git reflog is always my close friend, but a simple heads-up would have saved me a bit of time (esp. later, when I was online and tried to get to the bottom of the problem).\n\nI know the risks of living off master's bleeding edge, but that doesn't mean we can't do a few simple things to soften the edge a little :)\n"
