    "body": "This is because of the multi-file loading - apps load `ipython_config.py` followed by `<appname>_config.py`.  Which is a bit weird for the qtconsole, because the frontend's name is 'qtconsole', and the kernel is 'ipkernel', so they don't load the same second config.  I will fix this so the kernel's \"appname\" secondary config is inherited from the frontend, because the kernel should definitely load the frontend config.\n"
