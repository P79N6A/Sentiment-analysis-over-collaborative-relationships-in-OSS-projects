[Example](http://jsbin.com/orutip/11/edit).\npossibly you could load mathjax async under a controlled timeout via a script loader in the body\n\nrandom google link on [\"how  <script> can break your site\"](http://www.schillmania.com/content/entries/2009/defer-script-loading/).\n\nAlso, wasn't aware caching a local copy was that easy.
