    "body": "After seeing your response and looking back at the [docs](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/reference.html) I noticed similar code In one of the embed examples; my bad, I should have looked closer.\r\n\r\nHowever, I did notice a rather confusing comment in the example claiming:\r\n\r\n> The first argument is a string with options exactly as you would type them if you were starting IPython at the system command line. Any parameters you want to define for configuration can thus be specified here\r\n\r\nWhich implies a very different manner of configuration than in your example above (c is not a string?). Perhaps this comment could be revised to make more obvious the various ways that an embedded interactive shell could be configured, or better yet a section could be added to the embedding ipython part of the docs explaining configuration more thoroughly. Again, I might just be missing something.\r\n"
