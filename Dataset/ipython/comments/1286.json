There should be no reason to use C-c (ctrl+c) in the normal operation of ipython or readline because you have the default keybindings that you can override in your ~/.inputrc file.\n\nThis also seems to be related to the following upstream issues:\n- http://bugs.python.org/issue1175004\n- http://bugs.python.org/issue1744456\n\nI have also submitted pull request #2895 to deal with #1286 and #2486.\n"

    "body": "Also, I feel I should elaborate that I think the current situation is very dangerous. It's dangerous because commands can be re-executed in different contexts while writing code, possibly with different values that can compromise a project, file system, database, etc.\n\nMy proposed patch causes all KeyboardInterrupts to be intercepted (not just those caused during reverse search, which I couldn't figure out how to detect separately anyway). However, you shouldn't be causing a KeyboardInterrupt during normal use of ipython anyway (such as searching, writing, editing, deleting), so I think the proposed change is not too intrusive\n\n I should note that the proposed patch causes C-c on a normal line to cause the same line to appear in the input after recovering from the KeyboardInterrupt, but the user is given a message explaining the other more relevant keybindings anyway so the damage is minimal. Maybe there's a better way to solve this. For now, I think the best option is to immediately get rid of the dangerous situation with my patch.\n"
