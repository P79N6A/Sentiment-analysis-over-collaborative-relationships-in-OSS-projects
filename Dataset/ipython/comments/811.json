E.g. where cwd is used in tests, we might not want to catch the error, because that could mask something that's going wrong. And there may be other cases where it makes more sense to fail (with a helpful message) than to carry on with the user's home directory.\n"

To prevent such an\noccurrence but it could slip through in rare cases.  Instead of crashing\noutright this could warn the user. IMHO  It's a minor but nice failsafe\nfeature to have unless there is a good reason against having it. (Perhaps\nsome unintended effects I am not aware of ??)\nI can also foresee such a case occurring in a lab or a server where\nmultiple users access the machine at different times and aren't aware of\nany inherited changes.

    "body": "I'm generally against this --- it's not surprising that IPython will crash if there is no current working directory.  Most other command line tools will break, often with weird messages.  For example, after a quick setup:\n\n```\n$ mkdir tmp\n$ cd tmp\n$ rm -rf ../tmp\n```\n\n`bash` cannot write to files:\n\n```\n$ cat > hello\n-bash: hello: No such file or directory\n```\n\n`ls` can't list anything, not even the current directory:\n\n```\n$ ls -al # notice no output at all!\n$ \n```\n\nAnd `ipython` does give a proper error:\n\n```\n$ ipython\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n...\n  File \"/Users/bfroehle/src/ipython/IPython/core/profiledir.py\", line 203, in find_profile_dir_by_name\n    paths = [os.getcwdu(), ipython_dir]\nOSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory\n...\n```\n"

    "body": "@dhananjaysathe : Not crashing is a reasonable aim, but we don't need to protect every call to `os.getcwdu()` in this way. E.g. some of these are only called when starting up, or are part of the test suite, so they can't be hit in normal operation.\n\nBuilding on @ivanov's suggestion, I suggest you implement an [IPython extension](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/config/extensions/index.html). There's a hook which is called before each code execution (you can call `ip.set_hook('pre_run_code_hook', my_function)`). In your function, check if the cwd exists, and if it doesn't, cd to home and print out a message like 'WARNING: Working directory deleted. Your working directory is now...'.\n\nI'm going to close this pull request, as it's been sitting around for ages, and it's got various issues. You're welcome to implement a better solution and open a new PR, or talk to us on the mailing lists or on IRC if you want to know more.\n"
