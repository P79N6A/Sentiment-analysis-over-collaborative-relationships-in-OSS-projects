When I have a notebook where the first cell is:\n\n```\n%pylab\n```\n\n\"Run All\" will always hang even after having manually run that particular cell on its own.  After this, I have to Kernel->Restart in order to get the notebook to respond to anything.  My workaround is to run that cell manually by itself, move to the next cell and then \"Run All Below.\"\n\nI'm also happy to provide more info to help track this down further.\n"

    "body": "I can also confirm this (and it is rather annoying if you have a first cell with both `%matplotlib` and some imports (that take some time to execute), and you want to execute it together with the next cells).\n\nA simple way to reproduce this:\n1. A notebook with two cells:\n   \n   ```\n   %matplotlib\n   import time\n   time.sleep(10)\n   ```\n   \n   ```\n   print \"This will not print\"\n   ```\n2. Execute both at once (press shift-enter twice)\n3. The first cell will execute, but then the kernel hangs (second cell is not executed, you cannot execute anything, although the indicator says the kernel is ready).\n\n![untitled](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1020496/3748186/f2d56c5e-17d8-11e4-82cb-805cb3f8a990.png)\n\nSo it is not necessarily related to \"Run all\", but just to executing multiple cells where one cell has `%matplotlib`.\n\nTested it last with IPython 2.1, Windows 64 bit, Firefox 31\n"

So, this does not seem to be a good repro procedure (or internal workaround). :-/ \nI also found, like @tanderl, that the sleep workaround does not consistently work for me. This is on ipython 3.2.1 on Ubuntu 64bit. I can try the same thing on Windows tomorrow.\n"

For instance, they try running an example workbook provided by some plugin. With the current behaviour, users using the Run All command, or \"Shift + Enter\"ing quickly through the notebook will find that the notebook hangs from the very first moment, and this gives a very poor first impression. Such an impression can often really emphasise how \"complicated coding is\" to someone who is learning coding for the first time, or someone who has had a bad experience (class/exam) in the past."
