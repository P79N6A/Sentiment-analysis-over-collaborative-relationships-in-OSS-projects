In that case, I think it should actually save OK - even if the UI reports that it's failing, the failure should be after it has saved to the regular file.\n\nIf that is what's happened, I think it can only come about if the user has deliberately messed with those permissions, so I don't think it's something we need to worry about too much.\n"
