    "body": "Apart from the way that exceptions are handled in IPython there is a difference in Matplotlib. \n\nConsider the following code executed with a standard python command:\n\n```\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot(range(100))\nplt.text(0.5, float('nan'), 'Hello, World')\nplt.text(0.5, 1, 'Hello, other World')\n#plt.savefig('test.png')\nplt.show()\n```\n\nWhen running plt.show() the exception is not shown and the figure produced. When saving the figure with plt.savefig() the exception is thrown and the figure file is not produced.\n\nThe IPython inline backend is closer to the second that the first since it actually saves an image as png which is then inserted into the notebook which is why no figure is shown, while the figure is shown in an interactive matplotlib backend. \n"
