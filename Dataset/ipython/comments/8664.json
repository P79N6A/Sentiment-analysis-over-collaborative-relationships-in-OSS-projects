    "body": "It turns out that this issue, while made apparent by the way ipython saves checkpoints, is not really ipython's fault. Rather it appears to be a permissions thing with sshfs. For anyone who runs into this problem, a workaround is to change the mount options for your sshfs mount. Adding the following mount options allows saving with no problem:\n\n```\n-o workaround=rename,noexec\n```\n\nClosing this issue as it is unrelated to ipython, really.\n"
