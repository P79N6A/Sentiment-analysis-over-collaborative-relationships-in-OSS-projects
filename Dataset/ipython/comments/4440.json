I've worked up experimental tooling to convert the HTML that the publisher uses to power the Chimera ebook reader (http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001583/ch01.html) to ipynb format as part of an experiment to determine whether or not we might be able to offer the entire book in ipynb format, depending on interest. If we could get this particular issue worked out so that I could provide the nbviewer link, it would be really helpful.\n\nIt's a minimal conversion, but with the right styling could be really nice.\n"

    "body": "Actually, I'm wrong. It's because you are using `code` tags instead of `pre` tags to wrap those. If you use `pre` tags, it should pass through nbconvert just fine. the `pre` tag means that everything (including whitespace) must not be touched. I guess pandoc does not extend that same reservation to `code`.\n\nSide note: pandoc and marked (the live notebook js renderer) actually support pipe tables, so you don't need to wrap those in pre tags:\n\n```\n| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |\n| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|\n| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |\n| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |\n| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |\n```\n\nin markdown becomes:\n\n| Tables | Are | Cool |\n| --- | :-: | --: |\n| col 3 is | right-aligned | $1600 |\n| col 2 is | centered | $12 |\n| zebra stripes | are neat | $1 |\n"

What I'm doing is taking some HTML that's already been generated and trying to run it through nbconvert as-is, so I didn't think much about pre vs code tags until you mentioned it. I'll take a closer look and see if there's enough semantic markup in place that I can detect and render pipe tables as markdown, but if not, it sounds like I should be able to replace code tags with pre tags as a quick conversion and get the desired effects.\n"
