    "body": "Sorry I had forgotten I wrote you.  The problem was that I had enabled some features on the ipcluster_config.py on my mpi profile, file and I forgot to clean it up. Especifically I enabled the lines on \"MPIExecControllerLauncher configuration\" section, as you deduced from the log.  Finally I fixed it by disabling those lines and  adding the correct ones, namely:\n\nc.IPClusterEngines.engine_launcher = 'IPython.parallel.apps.launcher.MPIExecEngineSetLauncher'\nc.IPClusterEngines.engine_launcher_class = 'MPIExecEngineSetLauncher'\n\nIt was just a mistake of naives. Anyway thanks for your response; is good to know that there is support for such an important project. \n\nCheers\n"
