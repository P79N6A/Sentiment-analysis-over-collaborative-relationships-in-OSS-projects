I just spent some time reading the developer documentation again, specifically (https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Dev%3A-Testing) but can't find anything that explains the behavior. \n\nHere's specifically what I noticed:\n- something that should have been caught failed on Travis\n- repro on my system with iptest3 and the same code passed\n- since it was in py3compat.PY3, I added a version check and exit in a unit test\n- iptest3 still passed all tests\n- put in illegal syntax ($$$) \n- iptest3 still passed all tests\n- deleted the pyc file\n- iptest3 still passed\n\nIn all of the above cases, there are no messages about skipped tests (S or otherwise). The tests should definitely be failing at this point or - if they are being skipped - issuing some kind of warning. \n\nAny objection to me opening a separate issue on this? I'll be researching the fix and will update the documentation when I find it. \n"

Tell the user to avoid\n frustration._\n\nIdeally - and I understand that IPython is complex so please don't take this as a criticism - when the unit tests run they should be testing the _local_ code. They should be using local imports by running in the local directory. Local imports make it _impossible_ for unit tests to silently fail because they are running stale code located somewhere else on your file system. For integration tests, a flag should be passed in that specifies not to run the tests locally (this would be non-magic and not silent).\n"

    "body": "To avoid taking up too much of your time since you are both active contributors, perhaps I could do the following in the short-term:\n- Make it not be silent: When the tests are run, print where code is being imported from when the tests are run (i.e., no magic). This will make it no longer be silent about running non-local, stale code and add only one line to the test output. \n- Make it not be mysterious: Update the documentation so that it clearly explains the current design and the possibility of testing stale, non-local code. The behavior will still be unexpected but at least when someone reads the documentation they will know what's going on. \n\nLonger term, as I learn the codebase, I'll keep my eyes out to see if there are ways to get around the constraints that led to the current design (like, for example, passing a flag in the integration tests to allow them to run against an installed version instead of allowing it by default). If I find a way to keep all the benefits and improve it, I can send a pull request at that time. This will give you code to critique instead of just suggestions for improvements :]. \n"
