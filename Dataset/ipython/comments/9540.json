    "body": "```\nOK, but would it then be possible that the first item is selected by default?\n```\n\nThat's a valid request. Unlike several other prompt-toolkit based CLIs, IPython doesn't use the `complete_while_typing` option which generates completions as you type. When this is enabled, you don't want to automatically select the first completion, and pressing tab is required. In the case of IPython, use user explicitely presses tab, so in that case it makes sense to select the first completion by default. (Shift-tab can be used to undo this.)\n\nAny objections against? I can do this in the next minor version of prompt-toolkit as well. If not desired, it's also always possible to override.\n"
