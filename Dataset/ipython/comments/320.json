If readline/libedit segfaults in the middle of the completion code, ipython can't protect against that.\n\nIt seems in this case the problem is libedit, but in the past I've seen (and reported) similar crashes coming from Python's readline itself.  \n\nIt's fine to leave this one closed as it's not within our power to fix, unfortunately.\n"
