You can install install it with pip. \n\nThough you should not need it to build for local instal the css should be already bundled. \nIf you are just doing a local install you can probably do a `python setup.py symlink`, IIRC and  *nix only.\nand it should work. \n"

    "body": "Note that 'seeing errors' is different from there being any problem. Without invoke, you will see this:\n\n> Failed to build css sourcemaps: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'invoke'\n\nWhich means just what it says: you won't have css sourcemaps. This is not a problem, and installation succeeds just fine. You do not need less or invoke to install or run IPython, only to actively develop the LESS source files.\n\nShould we add to the \"Failed to build\" message an explicit \"this doesn't matter\"? Having invoke and lacking less looks like a real error, since it shows a traceback, but it's similarly inconsequential. Any actual error would prevent installation from succeeding.\n"
