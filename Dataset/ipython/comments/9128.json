If I run ipython without --pylab (no OSX backend), the python command line freezes every now and then, but Ctrl+C causes keyboard interrupt and it recovers. With --pylab and matplotlib OSX backend enabled, Ctrl+C does nothing, only killing the process works (or I haven't had the patience to wait long enough).\n\nFor me it doesn't require any arrow keys, just normal writing (typically fast) does the trick.\n\nSo, for me it seems that there's a problem with the ipython command line (readline?) and it would somehow clash with some other event loop if OSX backend is active ... just guessing ...\n"

    "body": "I've been having the same issue for a couple weeks now. I am always able to unlock it by hitting `<CTRL-C>` then `<enter>`. Whatever had been displayed before is in the history, so I can get back to where I was with `<up>`, but my session is littered with:\n\n```\nIn [56]: xy =\n\nKeyboardInterrupt\n\nIn [56]: xy = vor.points\n\nIn [57]: from scipy.spa\nscipy.spacing  scipy.sparse   scipy.spatial\n\nIn [57]: from scipy.spatial import\n\nKeyboardInterrupt\n\nIn [57]: from scipy.spatial import Co\n\nKeyboardInterrupt\n\nIn [57]: from scipy.spatial import ConvexHull\n```\n\nSo far, this is all I can gather:\n1. Problem occurs if I run `ipython --pylab` or if I run `ipython` then later run `%matplotlib`, but so far I think not otherwise.\n2. When it does occur, I can always free the interface and get the prompt back with `<CTRL-C><enter>`, but nothing else has worked. I tried other suggestions from this issue page, but `<CTRL-A>` and `<CTRL-E>` do not work. Waiting (for a few minutes) and clicking in and out of the terminal do not work.\n3. It happens without using arrow keys, just alphanumeric keys are sufficient. However, it seems to only happen when I'm typing the start of something defined. That is, if I jam keys randomly, it is fine, but if I type `np` it can freeze. This is not so certain, and hard to test since the freezing is inconsistent. It can happen when hitting `<Tab>` as well, which is especially annoying, since I first think `<Tab>` is doing nothing because I've misspelled something so no completion exists, but it turns out it's frozen, so I have to hit `<CTRL-C><enter><up>`, then `<Tab>` works.\n4. My keyboard repeat rate and delay are both set to the fastest setting. However, holding any keys down or typing randomly really fast do not induce the problem.

Like @leewalsh, I'm only able to get out with Ctrl-C.\n\nI'm running ipython without any flags.
