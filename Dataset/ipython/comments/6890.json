Can you summarize the public attributes, what they do and if they are r/w/rw to help us design the right API and naming?\n"

    "body": "More doc added, but this doesn't fix the underlying problem, I suppose.\n\nIf renaming was going to happen:\n- as mentioned, django has `choices`, and doesn't actually name the given value... \n- plain old javascript, of course, has `options` and `selectedIndex`... but is awkward for multiple values\n- in jquery, a select with multiple will give back a list in `val`, while the selector is `:selected`\n- qt has `items` and `selectedItem`\n\nSo I guess changing `value[_name]s` to `item[_name]s` or `choice[_name]s` or `option[_name]s` would be the least surprising, which `value[_name]` seems fine, and there is probably no way to make it clearer.\n"

    "body": "@jdfreder thanks, in fact needed a rebase... it was still using `traitlets.List`, which is a recipe for trouble, anyway, and now even `SelectMultiple.value` is a tuple.\n\nI also added some tests for `SelectMultiple` backend widgets... are there front end tests I should add?\n\nAs to the values/value/choices API question: `value` is a good and usable name for the thing that is selected, for its compatibility with all the other widgets. For widgets that can take multiple independent values, it should be pluralized. However, `values` is taken.\n\nHere are some options for (the things that can be chosen), (the thing that is chosen), (the things that are chosen):\n- `values`/`value_names`, `value_name`/`value`... ????\n  - confusing, even for non-multi-select. When `value` is usually to be a list, there's just no good way to name them, if the stem is the same.\n- `choices`/`choice_name`, `value_name`/`value`... `value_names`/`values`\n  - _could_ be construed as _I made this choice_, but its prevalence in other APIs suggests this isn't a common interpretation. \n- `items`/`item_names`,  `value_name`/`value`... `value_names`/`values`\n  - shortest! is what Qt uses.\n- `options`/`option_names`, `value_name`/`value`... `value_names`/`values`\n  - probably the clearest, and most accurate given its HTML intent, but `options` has connotations outside of _a list of discrete things that **could** be the value, but aren't neccessarily_, i.e. settings, configuration.\n"

Currently, the selection widgets have public traits `values` (the available choices), `value_name` (the text of the selected item) and `value` (the Python object associated with that), and private traits `_values_dict`, `_value_names`, and, magnificently, `_value_values`.\n\nI propose leaving `value` unchanged for consistency with other widgets, calling the available choices 'options' rather than 'values', and the text displayed for them 'labels' instead of 'names'. In full, the six traitlets would become:\n- `value`\n- `selected_label` (`selected_labels` for the multiple-selection case)\n- `options`\n- `_options_dict`\n- `_options_labels`\n- `_options_values` (I'd like to get rid of 'values' here, but I can't think of a better word right now)\n\nI'd also like to have a go at simplifying the logic for this, but that's a separate question.\n"
