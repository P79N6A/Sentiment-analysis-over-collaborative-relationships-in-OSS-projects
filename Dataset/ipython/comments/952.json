For some reason, the actual responsecode doesn't seem to be available, but this does seem to catch both cases of the 426 error, and the bug preventing websocket urls from matching the http one.\n\n@ellisonbg - is there a reason that the hostname/port of the websocket connection should not just match that of the http connection?\n"
