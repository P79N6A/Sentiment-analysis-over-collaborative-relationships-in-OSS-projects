    "body": "Cool. I also noticed that kernel.js grabs `document.cookie` which is currently empty for me. I grab the `document` from the `jquery` node module which instantiates a `jsdom` window/document anyways. So it's easily remedied, but it would be preferable to have the session value stored in the kernel object. \n\nI think having just baseline support for `kernel.js` would be good. Past that, I think the js files require the actual dom to exist.\n"
