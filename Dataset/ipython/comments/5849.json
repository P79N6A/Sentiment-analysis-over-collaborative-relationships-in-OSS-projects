    "body": "I don't think this is a bug in Ipython but perhaps in pyzmq.\n\nWhich Python version are you running? For some reason your pyzmq tries to import cffi according to https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq. This should only be used when running under pypy which cannot use the regular cython bindings. Perhaps it just falls back to this because the cython one fails. \n\nPerhaps try to just import pyzmq from a regular python console and run the pyzmq unit tests if possible. \n\nIf that fails I would surgest reinstalling pyzmq.\n"
