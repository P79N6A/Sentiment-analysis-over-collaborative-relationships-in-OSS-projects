    "body": "I'm not an expert on how the `%run` command works, but, if I understand correctly,  `script.py` is ran in it's own namespace, and then, some of the variable of this namespace are copied back into the IPython namespace. It seem to me that Qt/PySide will clean everything it i't not referenced. So the segfault appear on the copy back into the main namespace(?), except if it's already imported by `from qutip import *`.\n\nlook at #1001, and maybe some other issues ,  you can try `%run -i`which will run the program directly on IPython namespace, or `%run -p` not to copy back (I think it's `-p`, or is `-p` under the control of the debugger?). (see `%run?` for help, explanation and all options.) \n\nDoes it make sens ? (If anyone who understand this better than me can confirm or correct...)\n"
