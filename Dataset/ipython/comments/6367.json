One approach to notifying users of that problem would be: instead of 404ing the old location, instead serve javascript that adds such a message to the page. Another alternative would be to keep track of components as we move them around and have routing rules that would issue a 301 Moved Permanently in those cases.\n"

The goal he is to find a way to show something to the user that give some hints of what to do if there is a problem in js loading:\n\n```\n- Did you `pip install ipython[notebook]` otherwise you won't get JS\n- Did you try to force-refresh your browser ? \n- Please open the developpement console and look if you have error\n```\n\nThere is nothing more annoying that having a fucking white page and don't even know what to do. \nEven Gael and I, which are I think quite good user had a hard time figuring out why it was not working. \n\nWe already have a `<noscript>` that show a message if js is disable, the question do we at least try to show something if js crash ? \n"
