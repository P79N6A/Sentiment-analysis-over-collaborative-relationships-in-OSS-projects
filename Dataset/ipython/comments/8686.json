Furthermore, the full traceback is most of the time not that interesting (apart from where it was initially raised, but for the docs this is something like `<ipython-input-292-8c5fa6a37f5b> in <module>()\n----> 1 rng_hourly.tz_localize('US/Eastern')`) and contains some info that is specific to the user anyway (the paths of the files).\n"

If you are missing time or have any other issues that prevent you to work on that, please feel free to tell us, we can try to build on top of what you did. \n\nThanks a lot and looking forward to see this moving forward again.\n\n## \n\n@jorisvandenbossche : See you after your PhD ! Hope things are moving forward !\n"
