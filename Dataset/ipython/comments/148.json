    "body": "This is a bug in the standard library's pprint module. Their safe_repr isn't as safe as it could be. I will note that the \"pretty\" extension distributed with IPython does handle this case correctly. Perhaps it should be promoted to the default pretty-printing for IPython.\n\nFailing that, we should wrap pformat() in a try: except TypeError: block that falls back to a regular repr().\n"
