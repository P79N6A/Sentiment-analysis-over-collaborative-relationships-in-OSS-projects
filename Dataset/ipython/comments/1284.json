I imagine we are likely to run into this sort of thing a few more times before we rewrite the magic arg-splitting in a cleaner way.\n\nThe process_common thing is a bit funky - we really should _not_ be using the same code to split magic arguments and split strings into a Popen command-list, but we do, so your fix is probably in the right place.  That's more for the major reorganization of magics that @fperez has in mind.\n"
