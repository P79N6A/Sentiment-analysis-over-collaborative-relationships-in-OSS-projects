    "body": "To borrow @ellisonbg's beloved phrase---I think we are seeing a leaking in abstraction from having separate widget and output areas from the same input cell.  Perhaps it would be more clear to just have an input cell have output, which can be interspersed widgets and outputs.  The only objection I've heard is that the clear_output command is not well-defined, then.  So just make clear_output more explicit about exactly what it is clearing (or make it possible to clear _specific_ output instead of just a bazooka that clears everything.)\n"

    "body": "FWIW, in Sage we can define a specific output region with a context manager.  Anything executed inside the context manager gets some metadata appended to the output messages redirecting the output to a specific place (we do this by appending default metadata to the session python object).  Then when you issue something like a clear_output, it only clears the output pointed to by the metadata.\n\nSo something like:\n\n``` python\nwith new_output_region() as f:\n    some code that outputs things\n    will be put in a div tied to f\nsome other stuff\nf.clear_output() # clears the div f\n```\n"

    "body": "I don't think we have a leaky abstraction with separate widget and output areas in the same input cell. Here are the abstractions:\n1. All widgets go into the widget area.\n2. All outputs go into the output area.\n3. All widgets in a cell direct their output to that one output area.\n4. clear_output only affects the output area.\n5. Deleting a cell removes the output and widgets.\n6. Re-running a cell should clear the output and widgets.\n7. Anytime a widget view is removed from the page, we need to clean up that view.\n8. When all views are gone from the page do we cleanup the widget itself? (I don't remember exactly how this works.).\n\nThe behavior I am observing is only a bug with 6 and possible 7/8. But I don't see a problem with the abstractions themselves. Can you clarify? There might be, but I am not seeing it.\n\nI know you want to have multiple output areas. But that is a new feature/abstraction that should be considered on its own. I am +1 on thinking more about adding that feature, but I don't see how it is related to the current bug or leaks in our current abstractions.\n"

    "body": "My abstraction was much simpler: the input cells have output below them, and the output is either printed or display()ed.  Oh no! some of the output gets erased, but other output doesn't.  Oh yeah, the output actually has two types, so I have to think about whether display() is creating a widget, or some other kind of output.  It's confusing that display() can create two drastically different kinds of output with different lifecycles.\n\nBut I see your point too.
