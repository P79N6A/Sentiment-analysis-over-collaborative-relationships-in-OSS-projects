Probably best considered once we refactor the magics so they all share a base class, where this behavior can be implemented in a consistent manner.  So this is at least post 0.10, and likely post 0.11, since I'm sure the magic reorg will take some serious effort.\n"

My reasons for wanting to be careful is that\nI'd like an organized mechanism for coherently handling magics,\naliases and system calls.  So at least we should get feedback on this\nbug from the rest of the team to agree on a convention.\n\nIt's also important that magics be allowed to propagate an exception\nif they want, yet we want to record the failure in this special\nvariable.\n\nI'm all for solving this quickly, as long as we have a clean and\nlong-lived solution, not yet another quick hack that's a special case.\n\nCheers,\n\nf\n"
