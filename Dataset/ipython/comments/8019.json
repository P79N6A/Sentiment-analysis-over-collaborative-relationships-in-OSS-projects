I removed `focus()` here (in  `ipython/IPython/html/static/base/js/dialog.js`):\n\n```\n    modal.on(\"shown.bs.modal\", function() {\n        setTimeout(function() {\n            footer.find(\"button\").last(); // here was .focus()\n            if (options.open) {\n                $.proxy(options.open, modal)();\n            }\n        }, 0);\n    });\n```\n\nand that fixes it. \n\nDo you know what unintended consequences this change might have?\n"
