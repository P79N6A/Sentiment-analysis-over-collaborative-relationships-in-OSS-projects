If users are doing lots of bash scripting with their notebook files, they might choose space-less ASCII names for convenience.  But there is no reason we should enforce something like that.\n\n> ---\n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1815#issuecomment-6076470\n"
