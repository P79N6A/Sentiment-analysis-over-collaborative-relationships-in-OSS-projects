    "body": "At moment, thanks to a commit of @minrk, there is the possibility to pass an optional list of cell types to `CellToolbar.utils.select_ui_generator`. A toolbar, containg an element generated by that utility, is hidden if the cell, it belongs to, is of a type not in the list.\nHowever:\n1. That method can only be used to not show, in a cell, select elements generated by the\n   `CellToolbar.utils.select_ui_generator`.\n2. The UI element is created and inserted in the toolbar even for cell of type not in the list and only after that the toolbar is hidden. So there is a (little) waste of resources.\n3. When a toolbar contains an element generated by `select_ui_generator` and the cell is of a type not in `cell_types` list, the whole toolbar is hidden even if it contains other UI elements that should be shown in that cell.\n\nRegards\n"
