    "body": "Thanks, putting the code inside the init event works. I overlooked that because previously I added `IPython.load_extensions()` to `custom.js` and that does (should?) not need to be inside an event.\n\nAs I don't look at the output of the javascript console on default, my solution is to open a popup when something goes wrong. Basically, I embedded the code in `custom.js` into a try..catch block:\n\n```\ntry {\n    // Code goes here\n}catch(err) {\n    alert('custom.js:\\n'.concat(err))\n}\n```\n"
