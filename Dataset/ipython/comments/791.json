The console already has all the info necessary so it should be able to simply open the pager with it.  \n\n@epatters, do you think that's easy/realistic?  If so, we can leave this open (low priority) in case you or someone else has a chance to tackle it.  If you think it's doable but you don't have the time right now, it would be great if you can drop any pointers you might have off the top of your head on where to look.  That might entice a motivated user to have a go at it.  Often simply pointing people in the right direction so they know where to start suffices to get them doing a lot of work :)\n"

Right now the tooltip is somewhat obtrusive, but that's because it's meant to go away when you keep typing.  I actually very much like the idea of a more persistent area for this kind of info, but it would have to be smaller, as screen real estate is a limited resource in places like small laptops.\n\nBut if anyone can come up with a nice implementation of this that doesn't get too much in the way, I'm sure we'd be happy to review it.  Not being a UI gury (not by a long shot!), I have precious few concrete suggestions to make here...\n"

This would be helpful. Just my two cents.\n\nMaybe a magic function to call up a permanent tool tip window like mentioned @dallasmasters.

    "body": "@minrk \n\nThank you for the information. Based on it I was able to disable tooltips in IPython QtConsole 3.2.0 by running the following on Windows 7:\n\nC:\\Anaconda\\pythonw.exe \"C:\\Anaconda\\Scripts/ipython-script.py\" qtconsole --IPythonWidget.enable_calltips=False\n\nThis is automated by configuring it as the Target in my IPython QTConsole icons for Python 3.4.3 and 2.7.10.\n\nIn ~/.ipython/profile_ipython_config.py/ I found ipython_qtconsole_config.py, set c.IPythonWidget.enable_calltips = True in it and copyied it to ~/.ipython/profile_default/, but that had no effect. I tried a number of other locations for ipython_qtconsole_config.py including ~/.ipython/profile_default/startup/, ~/.jupyter/ and ~/.qtconsole/, but none had any effect.\n\nI guess that your advice concerning jupyter and JupyterWidget pertains to IPython 4.  I installed IPython 4.0.0 with IPython QTConsole 4.0.1, but afterwards was unable to launch IPython QTConsole and had to regress from that configuration.  I sent a message to Continuum Analytics about that with no reply yet.\n"
