    "body": "Actually, I'd like to block this on #1845, which refactors some of the inspection machinery, and actually change the code.py functionality to rely on oinspect (possibly making your improvements there as well).\n\nRight now we have file-finding code scattered all over, so it would be best to centralize all that into a robust module in oinspect, and just have the magics reuse it from there.\n\nHow does that sound?  I should be able to finish up #1845 in a day or two.\n"
