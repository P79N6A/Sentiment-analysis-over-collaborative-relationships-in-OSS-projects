    "body": "It does almost exactly what we do, but in a different order, and notably excluding HOMESHARE.  Unfortunately, based on Googling (many results being Brian trying to figure this out in the first place), it looks like cluster-users need to use HOMESHARE, because UNC paths should always be used there (with the wonderful contradiction that UNC paths must _never_ be used for subprocesses).\n\nI think @ellisonbg put HOMESHARE first, because that's the only way to get some parallel things to work on clusters.  The problem is, it's the wrong answer approximately everywhere else.\n\nCluster users are necessarily more advanced than local users, so maybe they should not be prioritized at the expense of everyone else.  If we fall back on os.path.expanduser('~'), then cluster users can trivially override the default with: `os.environ['HOME'] = os.environ['HOMESHARE']` (or equivalent in the shell, before starting Python).  The difference is, HOME is left to the user, whereas HOMESHARE/HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH are set by the system, so it makes sense that the easiest one to change should be the first priority, especially since it is already the first priority in Python itself.\n\nI should also note that on first glance, I think the [AvoidUNC shenanigans](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/utils/_process_win32.py#L120) we have to do should be able to wrap os.system, just like they are used to wrap the subprocess.
