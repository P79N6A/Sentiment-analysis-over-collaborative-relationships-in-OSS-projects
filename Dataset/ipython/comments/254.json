    "body": "I presume you mean 'scheduler is only two files', because 'hub' is five.  Honestly, the only reason they are separate is the point I mentioned earlier, that 'from controller import dependency' doesn't feel right to me, and 'from scheduler import dependency' does.  That said, user code will only ever import from IPython.parallel at the top-level, as that's where the API resides, so it's less important to have an intuitive import path.\n\ni.e.:\n\n```\nfrom IPython.parallel import Dependency, require\n```\n\nwhich both live in `IPython.parallel.scheduler.dependency`.\n\nThe Hub and Scheduler really are entirely decoupled - there are no links between the code in parallel.hub and parallel.scheduler, besides expected TCP connections.  The only coupling of the two appears in the controller startup script, that configures, launches, and connects them both.  You could definitely start a Hub without any schedulers, and schedulers without a hub, but we just haven't written those startup scripts.\n\nAs for your last question, I can certainly imagine schedulers growing, but I don't think we have any direct plans to really do so.\n\nWhat do you think?  Merge Hub+Scheduler into Controller?  That would leave engine/controller/client, which has a certain appeal, but while it is possible (and the norm) to use the Hub+Schedulers in the same way as the Controller was used before, they really are separate.\n\nCurrently, I think I am leaning towards merging them, I guess.\n"

The organization issue is mostly for developers finding\ntheir way around things.\n\n> The Hub and Scheduler really are entirely decoupled - there are no links between the code in parallel.hub and parallel.scheduler, besides expected TCP connections.  The only coupling of the two appears in the controller startup script, that configures, launches, and connects them both.  You could definitely start a Hub without any schedulers, and schedulers without a hub, but we just haven't written those startup scripts.\n> \n> As for your last question, I can certainly imagine schedulers growing, but I don't think we have any direct plans to really do so.\n> \n> What do you think?  Merge Hub+Scheduler into Controller?  That would leave engine/controller/client, which has a certain appeal, but while it is possible (and the norm) to use the Hub+Schedulers in the same way as the Controller was used before, they really are separate.\n> \n> Currently, I think I am leaning towards merging them, I guess.\n\nI think I agree, the controller concept as the package that contains\nthe data hub plus scheduling policies makes good sense to me.\n\nCheers,\n\nf\n"

At that point things will\nstart looking very much like what 0.11 final will be, modulo the\nconfig work and a few more minor things, so it will really be time to\nget user feedback.\n\nBrian, we'll chat about networkx later for sure.\n"
