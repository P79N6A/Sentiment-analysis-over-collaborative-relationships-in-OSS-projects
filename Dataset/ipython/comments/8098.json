That is by far the more important consideration in terms of user experience and as a foundation to prevent more related issues.\n\nFinally, the resizer (I think) is not widely used or even easily recognized. Its removal is not likely to disrupt the workflow of users. Actually, I would worry about excessively using the resizer to obtain larger images instead of doing it programmatically.\n"

When I'm trying to make publication ready figures, it is nice so set the figsize that will put the text in proportion with the plot, and use the resize handle to get a closer look.\n\nIs there another solution to quickly and easily scale figures? Like actually scale everything? Or do I have to output to a file and view it from there now?\n"
