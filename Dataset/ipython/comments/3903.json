    "body": "Late, but sure...\nOK, regarding Mathjax, the current implementation is not able to detect the local installed mathjax a use it...\nNor for slides neither from HTML formats... you can change this behavior just modifying the templates to load the js file from a local dir... Making this selection automatic would be interesting, but I do no think we can make it for 1.0 release...\n\n> the difference is the extract output transformer, which currently only runs for the latex exporter by default. You can enable it for slides as well, but you would have to change the reveal template to use the output filenames instead of the embedded images.\n\nIf this is the problem (probably) you have to change the basic_html template because full_html and reveal templates are inherited from this basic_html template which is dealing with the basic blocks at lower level...\n"

I just wanted to show to you that it's okay to store the data in that form and still parse it correctly.\n\nI'm testing on Windows + Python 3.3 too.\n"
