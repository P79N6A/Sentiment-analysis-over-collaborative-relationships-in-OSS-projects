Curious as to why it is blinking?\r\n\r\nThat seem to be a mishandling (?) of the terminal.app in 10.6.  It may confuse some color information with blinking. I can't say _for sure_  but it seem to be a [known issue](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/963) that may be fixed by changing terminal type. \r\n\r\nAlso I would recommend to try another terminal emulator (like iTerm 2) on OSX. Terminal.app is one of the worst you can have. "
