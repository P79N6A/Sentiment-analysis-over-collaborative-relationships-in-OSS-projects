    "body": "> thanks for the hint. I opened an issue #4841.\n> I had a look at the ipython source and can confirm that this should not happen, since saving a notebook essentially only uses the standard json module + encode().\n> To debug this: How to start a notebook server from a ipython shell (ideally from the source directory) so that I can use pdb for interactive debugging?\n\nTechnically that would be \n\n``` python\nfrom IPython.html import notebookapp as app\napp.launch_new_instance()\n```\n\nBut that will raise a `MultipleInstanceError` if you try to run it from inside IPython.\n"
