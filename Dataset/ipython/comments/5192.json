    "body": "Strange. The problem is fixed when I checkout your (@jdfreder) 'scrollbar' branch .. However when I checkout the SHA in my bug report, it also works!... also when I checkout head. I cleared the browser cache, checked I'm running ipython in my virtualenv for the dev version, checked that the ipython.egg-link points at my local git repo... \n\nWell, firefox is now version 28.0, could that have changed things? I could try rolling it back (`apt` would do that I guess?), but perhaps it's not worth the bother. It's a little unsettling that I can't reproduce the bug though!\n\nOne cosmetic thing I might suggest if it's easy to do: add a little padding to on the right of the cell content. When scrolled to the far right, the longest line touches the boundary of the cell.\n"
