    "body": "It's not clear if the original reporter was attempting to use this correctly. `complete_objects` is a generic, and should be extended like this:\n\n```\n@generics.complete_object.when_type(MyClass):\ndef f(myclass_obj, prev_completions):\n    return #Stuff from myclass_obj\n```\n\n(there's also a `when_object` decorator for specific objects)\n\nThe TryNext errors are raised when it doesn't find a matching type or object to dispatch to, and appear to be caught in core/completer.py (line 372). So I'm not sure that this is actually a bug.\n"
