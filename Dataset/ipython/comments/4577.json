    "body": "Hi,\n\nSorry for the late response. I did what you said, and it looks like the notebook is not loading any of the JS files. Here is the output of the console:\n\n```\n % ipython notebook\n2013-11-24 13:01:08.463 [NotebookApp] Using existing profile dir: u'/home/daniel/.config/ipython/profile_default'\n2013-11-24 13:01:08.491 [NotebookApp] Using MathJax from CDN: http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js\n2013-11-24 13:01:08.536 [NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /home/daniel/Misc/src\n2013-11-24 13:01:08.537 [NotebookApp] The IPython Notebook is running at: http://127.0.0.1:8888/\n2013-11-24 13:01:08.537 [NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).\nCreated new window in existing browser session.\nWARNING:root:404 GET /static/components/jquery-ui/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.min.css (127.0.0.1) 0.60ms\nWARNING:root:404 GET /static/components/requirejs/require.js (127.0.0.1) 0.42ms\nWARNING:root:404 GET /static/components/jquery/jquery.min.js (127.0.0.1) 0.48ms\nWARNING:root:404 GET /static/components/jquery-ui/ui/minified/jquery-ui.min.js (127.0.0.1) 0.39ms\nWARNING:root:404 GET /static/components/bootstrap/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js (127.0.0.1) 0.41ms\nWARNING:root:404 GET /static/components/jquery-ui/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.min.css (127.0.0.1) 0.51ms\nWARNING:root:404 GET /static/components/requirejs/require.js (127.0.0.1) 0.30ms\nWARNING:root:404 GET /static/components/jquery/jquery.min.js (127.0.0.1) 0.49ms\nWARNING:root:404 GET /static/components/bootstrap/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js (127.0.0.1) 0.29ms\nWARNING:root:404 GET /static/components/jquery-ui/ui/minified/jquery-ui.min.js (127.0.0.1) 0.28ms\n```\n\nSo, apparently all the JS files give 404 errors.. not good. I also went to the JS console. The JS errors are just what you would expect given the above errors:\n\n```\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) http://127.0.0.1:8888/static/components/jquery-ui/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.min.css\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) http://127.0.0.1:8888/static/components/requirejs/require.js\nUncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined 127.0.0.1/:29\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) http://127.0.0.1:8888/static/components/jquery/jquery.min.js\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) http://127.0.0.1:8888/static/components/bootstrap/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js\nFailed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) http://127.0.0.1:8888/static/components/jquery-ui/ui/minified/jquery-ui.min.js\nUncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined \n```\n\nSo, the problem is probably not in the CSS after all, but in the loading of the JavaScript.\n"
