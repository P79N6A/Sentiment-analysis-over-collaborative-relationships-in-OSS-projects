    "body": "Hi, it was indeed a problem with the number of retries being larger than the number of engines (I was running just was engine in the example). Thank you for solving this one!\n\nPerhaps I could also ask a question about the the timeout. I was under the impression that the timeout is set on the result collection (i.e. the call to AsyncMapResult.wait or AsyncMapResult.result). In other words it would be timeout on the completion of the whole view.map computation rather than the individual task (part of the data that is being mapped). Am I wrong about this?\n"

Since they are all submitted at the same time, the practical effect (most of the time) is that they will all timeout together.  But the Scheduler evaluating the timeout does not know that they are related to each other.\n"
