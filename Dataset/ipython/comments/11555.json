    "body": "Thanks for the proposal. \r\nWhat I would suggest is to package your magic, and put it on PyPI. \r\n\r\nIt's relatively easy, look at [flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to do that for example. \r\n\r\nOnce its matures and is quite stable, we can consider including it. \r\n\r\nThere are many advantages to packaging, in particular you are not limited by us if you need a modification to the magic, and you can make it available to users of older version of IPython. \r\n\r\nHow does that sound ?
