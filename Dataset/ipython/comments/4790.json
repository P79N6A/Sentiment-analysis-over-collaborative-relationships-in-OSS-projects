I think there are only three of our default shortcuts that will have problems - `shift+=`, `.` and `alt+-`. We're thinking about ways to handle it, including defining some shortcuts on the KeyPress event (which follows characters rather than keys), or just avoiding shortcuts on punctuation keys.\n"

    "body": "Thank you for the quick reply. I'm sorry that I have missed that this was a known issue (e.g. https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/3605#issuecomment-32059054).\n\nUsing KeyPress instead of KeyDown sounds like a good solution. However, don't you think that this should be done for all shortcuts involving printing characters (i.e. not only for those involving punctuation keys) to avoid problems for users on non-latin keyboards? \n\nWill you consider binding \"merge cell bellow\" to `J`? I think that Vim users (and those of many other editors that bind some combination of `j` and modifiers to \"join lines\") will find it more natural than `shift+=` or `+`. Similarly—just to add my two cents to an idea that have already been proposed—I think that it would be nice to bind `Ctrl + x|c|v` to `cut|copy|paste` in command mode as, in my opinion, binding them just to plain `x|c|v` risks confusing vim and non-vim users alike. I guess that the argument that this may conflict with OS or browser bindings doesn't apply to this particular set of shortcuts, isn't it? Also it would be nice if `Ctrl+m+character` keeps on working as in previous version i.e. execute a command and re-enter edit mode—this is likely to save keystrokes in some circumstances.\n"
