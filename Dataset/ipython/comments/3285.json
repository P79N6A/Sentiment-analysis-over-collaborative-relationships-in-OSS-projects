    "body": "The reason is my `editmate` extension, which I have started to deprecate, since editorhooks has now been fixed.\nBut the appropriate deprecation:\n\n``` python\nfrom IPython.lib.editorhooks import mate\nmate()\n```\n\ncan't be called from an extension, because the editorhooks themselves use `get_ipython()`.  This is only true of extensions loaded at startup, as anything in regular user code is inside a cell, and thus inside `builtin_trap` already.  The result is that extensions loaded at startup run in a different environment from extensions loaded via `%load_ext`.\nThe alternative is a smaller patch that just puts the `init_extensions` in builtin_trap, which is a more localized fix, but will be easily broken again if other code initializes extensions in a different way.\n"
