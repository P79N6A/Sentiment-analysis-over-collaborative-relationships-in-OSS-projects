    "body": "Pylab mode imports from numpy and matplotlib.pyplot into the global namespace. One of the functions imported is numpy.any. This behaves differently from the python standard one. It has nothing to do with the notebook or the console. The same would happen with Pylab mode in the console. \n\nIPython now has a matplotlib mode which can be used instead of pylab and does not import anything into the global namespace but just activates plotting. I think this is the best solution. \n\nNote that you can activate pylab and matplotlib mode directly from the notebook with %pylab=inline and %matplotlib=inline instead of the command line argument making it easier to test these things. \n"
