It would also be great to be able to generate diff for merge and split.\n\nThe only  solution I see (i might be wrong) is to keep the ancestry of a cell, which, I think would not be too big, as split and merge are not common. \n\nPasted  and splited cell just get the previous cell id as parent.\nMerged cells have 2 parents.\n"
