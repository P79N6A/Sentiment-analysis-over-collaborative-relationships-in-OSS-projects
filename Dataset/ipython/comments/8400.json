Most, if not all, alternative backends don't involve a GUI eventloop (e.g. the inline backend that ships as part of IPython), so the mapping IPython uses for that information doesn't need to do anything. It's possible the fix is as simple as changing from `map[key]` to `map.get(key, None)`, but we should think carefully about that.\n"
