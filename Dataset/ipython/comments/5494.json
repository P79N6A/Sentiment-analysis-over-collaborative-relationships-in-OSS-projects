    "body": "Ctrl-m is an alias for Esc, so Ctrl-m-m still will put you into markdown\nmode.\n\nThese are not merely new keyboard shortcuts. The old model was entirely\nbroken in that it made decisions to focus cells that caused horrific\njump-scrolling in the UI. Fixing that required us to put focus in the hands\nof the user. The manual focusing we were doing was also completely\ninconsistent with the new Widgets which also need to gain focus at times.\nSummary: there is absolutely no going back at this point.\n\nHowever, we will be the first ones to acknowledge that there are some rough\nedges with some of the choices we have made. As of yet, we don't see how to\nmake better choices globally. What do I mean by that? There are many\ndifferent ways that people use the notebook UI:\n- Creating a new notebook from scratch.\n- Editing an existing notebook with lots of exiting cells.\n- Lots of Markdown cells...or lots of code cells...\n- Running a notebook but not changing it.\n- ...\n- Arbitrary combinations of these types of activities\n\nWhat we find is that it easy to change the keyboard shortcuts to optimize\nfor a subset of these activities, but that typically makes the other\nactivities worse. We are trying to build a set of shortcuts that provide\nthe best overall experience across all of these activities. We not\nconvinced we have found the optimal solution, so this type of feedback is\nreally helpful. But it is going to take a good amount of time - probably\nmonths - for us to gather enough data from users to make the next set of\ndecisions.\n\nIn the meantime, we encourage users to customize their keyboard shortcuts\nto try out different things and set what works for them.\n\nOn Wed, Apr 2, 2014 at 10:18 AM, Thomas Kluyver notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Spend a while working with them - it does require some relearning, but\n> most of us are finding it better than the old scheme once we're used to it.\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/5494#issuecomment-39357723\n> .\n\n## \n\nBrian E.

Is there a specific issue to discuss this or should I create a new one ?\n\nIs it in the `keyboardmanager.js` file (https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/html/static/notebook/js/keyboardmanager.js#L160) that all this is defined ?\n"
