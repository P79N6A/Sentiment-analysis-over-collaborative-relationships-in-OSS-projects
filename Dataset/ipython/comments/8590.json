    "body": "Hi,\n\nif you are doing something like\n\n```\nsomethings\n#long computation\na = 1\n```\n\nthen accidentally reload, then later you can still do `print(a)` to see the value of `a`. There is nothing specific to do for that. Though the ids that binds what you want to display are gone when you reload, to \n\n```\nsleep(60)\nprint(a) \n```\n\nif you reload while it sleeps, there is no way to get what `print(a)` would have done, except  redoing it. \nWe are working on that, it will take some time, and it will be automatic once it works. \n\nIn the meantime, separate long computation cell from graphing/plotting/printting, and store intermediate results. \n\nYou then \"just\" have minimal work to redo if reloading. \n\nWhen you reload and something is still happening, you should get a warning asking you if you are sure. \nSo this should not happend to you, tell us if this is not the case. \n"
