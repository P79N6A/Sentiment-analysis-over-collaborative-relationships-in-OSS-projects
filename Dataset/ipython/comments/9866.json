    "body": "Hi @Anne623 , \n\nThanks for your questions; it's true the Jupyter/IPython separation is a bit confusing, but in your case it seem like this should not affect you;\n\nIndeed when you start the Jupyter notebook to write Python, by default it will connect to IPython under the hood. So the `c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines` should be executed when you switch to a notebook.\n\nI just tried locally and it seem it works for me:\n\n<img width=\"539\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-08-14 at 10 23 36\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/335567/17650709/44360f0a-6209-11e6-8e41-731f8be2495b.png\">\n\nLet us know if it's not the case for you in which case we can diagnose what's wrong on your system, on if my explanation are unclear. \n\nThanks. \n"

    "body": "Sorry I was uncler @Anne623 ; \n\nJupyter has it's own set of config (likely in `~/.jupyter` for you), and these configuration only affect the Jupyter components; not each individual kernels.\n\n The IPython configuration have not moved, they are likely in `~/.ipython` for you, but you can check with `$ ipython locate`.\n\nI know it is confusing as we are the same people that use both Jupyter and IPython, but as IPython is used by users that don't install Jupyter, and Jupyter is used by users that don't write Python, we tend to think of both project independently, and store configuration in separate directories.\n\nDoes that makes sens ? We are always looking for better ways to express the Jupyter vs IPython differences.\n\nFor example here is my IPython config, where I srip all the comments:\n\n```\n$ cat ~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py  | grep -v '#'\n\nc.InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines = ['test = \"isusse 9866 for Anne623\"']\n```\n\nWith that, both the `ipython` accessed from the command line REPL and the Jupyter notebook have theses lines executed at startup.\n"
