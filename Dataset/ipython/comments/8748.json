    "body": "Hrm.. thoughts please:\n\ncurrently, the row-first option calculates the optimal layout by starting with the max number of rows, then calculating the minimum number of columns, which may end up being much smaller than the display width. For example, this is the current result:\n\n``` python\nIn [3]: [s*15 for s in 'abcdef']\nOut[3]: \n['aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa', 'bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb', 'ccccccccccccccc'\n 'ddddddddddddddd', 'eeeeeeeeeeeeeee', 'fffffffffffffff']\n```\n\nAnother option would be to maximize the columns, while remaining under the display limit. which would look like this:\n\n``` python\nIn [3]: [s*15 for s in 'abcdef']\nOut[3]: \n['aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa', 'bbbbbbbbbbbbbbb', 'ccccccccccccccc', 'ddddddddddddddd'\n 'eeeeeeeeeeeeeee', 'fffffffffffffff']\n```\n\nwhich might look nicer in some cases. However, it would never be more efficient in terms of space used, and it would require somewhat more complex code. \n\nDo you care which option is used?\n"
