I appreciate the heads-up.\n\n> There's no reason to have the suffix to avoid collision, since it's not a language keyword.\n\nEven if it's not a language keyword, shadowing `type` inside the function will have unfortunate side-effects if you want to use the `type` builtin inside one of these functions.  You can always use `__builtin__.type` if you need it but that's a real reason to avoid doing this if possible.\n\nIn this case, however, I do agree that consistency with the model keys is probably more important.\n"
