(Unrelated syntax error)  I'll re-commit in a few minutes.\n\nSo let me ask...what is the appropriate granularity for commits and pull\nrequests?  I have a few things that are more-or-less one liners:\n1) Enable paren matching\n2) Enable tab indentation (highlight text, tab/shift-tab indent/outdent --\n    important for python!)\n3) 1px/border jumping in cells, menu\n4) click causing refocus and scrolling of output\n\n#1 and #2 are just one-line configuration options to CodeMirror.  The others\nsimilarly are very small.\n\nShould I make 4 commits and 4 pull requests?\n\n## \n\nCheers, Bob McElrath\n\n\"The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by\nthe tribe.

    "body": "We don't have any hard rules on commit granularity, but you should keep to the usual guideline of making a commit a reasonably localized (conceptually) operation.  A single commit may touch several files (sometimes many), but it should 'be one thing'.  Basically if a commit can't be well described by the first line summary plus at most a handful of lines of detail, it's probably too big.\n\nAs for pull requests, they should be _strongly_ confined to soiving one problem only: a bug fix, implementing a feature, etc.  Now, sometimes 'one problem' may be [absolutely huge](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1732), but such monsters are best avoided (in that case it really was 'one thing', just that it was something that touched pretty much all of IPython).  \n\nAnd conceptually, the PR really should have a strong unity.  Just like a commit should be explainable in a concise form, the PR should also be well described by the summary box github offers.  If you find that you're describing a bunch of loosely related things, that may be a sign to break up the PR into several.\n\nKeep in mind: short, simple PRs are really easy to review, so if you have to, err on the side of more smaller ones rather than fewer bigger ones.  I (or someone else) may have 10 minutes to review/merge one or two small ones, but if I see something huge I'll keep postpoining it until I have a few hours free.\n\nSince multiple people can and do review, by making them more digestible you dramatically raise the chance they'll get processed rapidly.\n"
