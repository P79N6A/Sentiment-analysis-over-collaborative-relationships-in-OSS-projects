    "body": "I don't see any way of doing this.  It would require not clearing the output when a cell is re-executed and I don't think that makes sense.  For parametric analysis of this type we are working on interactive widgets that will allow you to use various UI controls to manipulate parameters and see how they affect things like plots.  In that architecture it will be possible to do everything in a way that holds the scrolling fixed.  Because this usage case will be covered by that work, I am going to close this issue.\n"
