I figured out a [workaround](http://stackoverflow.com/a/35327111/2452770) (which is obvious in hindsight) that involves getting the logging handler and setting its level first. But bringing notebook in line with IPython and with general intuition (if I haven't set a handler up there shouldn't be one) seems like a good idea. \n"
