    "body": "> Does it has any reason to break user code ?\r\n\r\nI don't think so, but you never know. The one valid use case for variable expansion that I can think of is shell-style *args*, leaving the code block unparsed. e.g. this technically makes sense:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndest = \"myresult\"\r\n%timeit -o $dest some_python_code()\r\nprint(myresult)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut with this patch (and the magics implementation in general) variable expansion is all or nothing. We could try a deeper fix to try to *only* disable parsing of the code block, but that would require pretty deep changes, as the decision to implement var expansion would need to happen at a level where arguments are understood, violating the \"magics are passed the line as a string\" concept.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother technically valid use could be building the code to time in a Python variable, and then running:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ncode = \"np.sin(x)\"\r\n%timeit {code}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've never seen it before, but it might exist in the wild. In both cases, I think the tradeoff of never mangling the Python code is worth it.\r\n\r\n\r\n> I'm going to leave that for 7.3 \r\n\r\nüëç I had no intention of sneaking this under the wire, I just hadn't noticed that 7.2 was ready for release. 7.3 is perfect."
