    "body": "The issue is (as usual with print weirdnesses) an issue of display_pub and print talking on the same channel, but print statements not writing to the stream until `stdout.flush()` is called, which is triggered implicitly and asynchronously by some arcane magic.\n\nSolution: display_pub methods should imply `sys.stdout/err.flush()` to preserve ordering.\n\nSee PR #1541 for such a fix.\n"
