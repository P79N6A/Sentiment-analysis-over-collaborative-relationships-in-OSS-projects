    "body": "Thanks for the feedback. It' true that I had never felt annoyed by Markdown cells changing size when rendered. So it's not an issue of rendering complexity/time as I thought it could be.\n\nNow, what I don't understand is the link between : 1) the change of size at rendering, and 2) the ability to move cells up and down. Because I can move the cells both in rendered and unrendered state. And there is no size jumping in either cases. I think I'm just missing the advantage of moving cells unrendered.\n\nAlso, going a bit deeper, what annoys me right now is that there are in effect 3 modes (for Markdown and heading cells) instead of the two (Edit and Command) being advertised:\n1. Edit mode\n2. Command mode, unrendered (which I feel a bit extraneous ;-) )\n3. Command mode, rendered\n\nand more modes mean more transitions to learn...\n\nMaybe as a compromise solution, the automatic rendering could be activated for heading cells, since the size jump should be relatively small with those ?\n"
