Repenting, I've re-pushed a smaller change that everyone agrees on: `CTRL-D` on an empty line prompts to exit. The delete character functionality works here without an entry in `_ctrl_down_remap` - but it'd be good to hear that's still the the case for others. \n\nOh, I also added a doc of `Ctrl-U` which was previously missing.\n"
