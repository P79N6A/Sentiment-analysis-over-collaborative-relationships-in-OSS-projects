I suspected that this had something to do with the fact that keywords are bolded and that bold letters are slightly larger than normal letters. I was able to fix this issue by adding the following CSS directive to remove all bold styles.\n\n`* {\n    font-weight: normal !important;\n}`\n\nI'm using Google Chrome on Ubuntu but the issue happens for me on Google Chrome on OS X as well.

    "body": "I dug into this a bit in investigating all the reasons cells were jumping around.  \n\nIt is caused by Chrome choosing fonts for which the bold and italic variants do not have the same height as the normal variant.  On my computer (Ubuntu 12.04, Chrome 20 beta), Chrome is choosing \"Courier New\" as the monospaced font, while Firefox is choosing \"Bitstream Vera Sans Mono\".  The Bitstream fonts do not have this problem that different weights have different heights, which is why Firefox did not display the problem.  You can fix it in Chrome too by changing its font to the Bitstream one.\n\nSo technically, this is a browser bug, and I was unable to find a way to fix it using CSS.  Fixing line-height, font-size, etc, do not work to fix this bug.  The only thing that fixes it is to avoid bold and italic fonts as pointed out by @ellisonbg, **or** to make an explicit list of fonts using CSS font-family.\n\nFonts which do **not** have the problem on my computer include:\n- Bitstream Vera Sans Mono\n- Droid Sans Mono\n- DejaVu Sans Mono\n- FreeMono\n- Liberation Mono\n- Luxi Mono\n- Mono Uralic\n- Monospace\n- Monotype.com\n- Ubuntu Mono\n- WenQuanYi Zen Hei Mono\n- WenQuanYi Micro Zen Hei Mono\n\nFonts that **do** have the problem on my computer include:\n- Courier New\n- Nimbus Mono L\n\nPerhaps someone on windows or mac can tell us which fonts do or don't have the problem?  I find the easiest way is to type two or more lines that do not contain any bold/italic keywords, and add \"print\" or something which gets bolded to the _first_ line.  The second you hit the 't' of 'print', the text below it will shift down by 1px or so.  You may have to zoom in, making to font larger, to see this.  Simultaneously, choose the mono font in your browser settings.\n\nChange these lines in notebook.css to fix it, using the fonts above, or some subset thereof... \n\n.CodeMirror pre {\n    line-height: 1.231em;  /\\* Changed from 1em to our global default */\n    font-family: 'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono', 'Droid Sans Mono', 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'FreeMono', 'Liberation Mono', 'Luxi Mono', 'Mono Uralic', 'Monospace', 'Monotype.com', 'Ubuntu Mono', 'WenQuanYi Zen Hei Mono', 'WenQuanYi Micro Zen Hei Mono', monospace;\n}\n\nWhat is the reasoning behind the odd 1.231 font size (also in boilerplate.css)?

Some points:\n- I agree that this is a browser bug - we could simply tell people this and that they need to change their monospace font on Chrome as a workaround.

There was a moderately strong opinion amongst the devs that we should _not_ list font explicitly.  Up to know that has served us well.\n- Not using bold or italic fonts in the CodeMirror editors is a simple fix, but it is nice for syntax highlighting purposes.\n\nWhew, this is a very tough choice.

For example, I have configured chrome to use\nConsolas as my monospaced font, because Courier New is quite possibly\nthe single worst monospaced font on the face of the planet, and I have\nno clue why an otherwise competent browser like chrome makes such a\nboneheaded choice by default.\n\nI get unbelievably annoyed when sites hardcode monospaced fonts\nbecause they never hardcode consolas as an option, the one that I like\nbest (and I obsessively test monospaced font every year or two to see\nif that choice changes).  So as long as we put consolas on that list\nin front of everything else (which won't harm anyone who doesn't have\nit) I don't mind.  Hardcoding anything else will drive me insane.\n"

'monospace' as the first option is not viable.  As a desperate fallback\nit's better than nothing.\n\nAnother alternative would be to serve up a reasonable font itself.
