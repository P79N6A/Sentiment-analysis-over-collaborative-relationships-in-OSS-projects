But the trick is NOT measuring anything when you call methods and attributes in %stats object which holds the profiling data. So I need some kind of a hook which runs BEFORE the pre_run_code_hook and gives me the ability to temporary disable profiling when i call %stats magic.\n\nIt's not very clear how to add custom input transformer, as the page only describes how to declare one, maybe I am missing something ?\n"

    "body": "I guess you're talking about this page? http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/config/inputtransforms.html\n\nLooking back at it, I agree it's not very clear how to add an input transformer. The closest it gets to describing that is this sentence: \"An InteractiveShell instance actually has two IPythonInputSplitter instances, as the attributes input_splitter, to tell when a block of input is complete, and input_transformer_manager, to transform complete cells. If you add a transformer, you should make sure that it gets added to both.\"\n\nFrom an extension, that would look something like this:\n\n```\ndef load_ipython_extension(ip):\n    ip.input_splitter.logical_line_transforms.append(my_transformer())\n    ip.input_transformer_manager.logical_line_transforms.append(my_transformer())\n```\n\nNote that you have to decide which of `physical_line_transforms`, `logical_line_transforms` and `python_line_transforms` your transformations act on:\n- physical transforms get a line each time the user presses enter (e.g. stripping prompts)\n- logical transforms get lines with backslash continuations stitched together (e.g. transforming line magics)\n- Python transforms get multi-line strings, lists, etc. assembled into blocks\n\nYou can also define AST transforms, which can inspect and modify the parsed Python code before it is executed.\n"
