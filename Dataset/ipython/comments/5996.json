    "body": "@minrk Umm it is slightly more complicated then it seems. Actually, It is not my Javascripts which are breaking, but notebooks' javascripts are broken, after prototype.js is loaded(in output cell). \n\nnotebook's native jQuery is loaded in the head(when notebook is initialized), and prototype.js is loaded when I call the visualizer in output cell. After it is loaded, the visualizer works fine, but other notebook's elements(like toolbar, and input cells) start breaking, and I get a hell lot of \n\n```\nundefined is not a function\n```\n\nerrors in console. Even if I use require.js, after prototype.js is loaded, it overwrites  `$` selector(of native notebook's jQuery).\n\nHere is a screenshot of my console:\n\n![screenshot from 2014-06-17 15 41 59](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1546532/3298847/e3377636-f607-11e3-87e4-c900a007af45.png)\n"
