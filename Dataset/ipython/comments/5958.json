    "body": "Hi Sylvain,\n\nIIRC the problem with indexing by `child.id` instead of `model.id` is that the back-end has no notion of views.  In the back-end there simply exists widgets that have a single replica counterpart (the model) in the front-end.  However, I do think that the \n\n``` python\nslider = IntSliderWidget()\ndisplay(slider, slider)\n```\n\nis a bug.  It shouldn't work, only one view should display.  The behavior should be:\n- One model in the notebook per widget in the back-end.\n- Many views per model in the notebook (as many views as there are cells).\n- One view per model per cell in the notebook.\n"
