    "body": "My guess is you are hitting FD limits (a downside of using zmq is a large number of FDs per engine).  To get better output, try starting the controller separately:\n\nInstead of `ipcluster start -n N`, do `ipcontroller` in one shell, then `ipcluster engines -n N` in another (nothing is different, it's just easier to see controller output this way, and controller crash won't trigger `stop_launchers()`).\n"

    "body": "Thanks for the advice. You're right, it was related to the system running out of FDs; a quick change of ulimit setting made the problem go away. There is still some instability creating large numbers of engines (I've just spooled up 600, of which only 598 managed to register, leaving two orphaned processes in the MPI universe and preventing automated shutdown using `Client().shutdown(targets='all')`), but that's definitely much better. :)\n"
