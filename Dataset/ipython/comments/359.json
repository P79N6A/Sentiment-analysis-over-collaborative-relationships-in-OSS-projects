    "body": "This is application-specific functionality that belongs in ipythonqt. \n\nNow that the widget itself is stabilizing, it is probably worth building out some infrastructure for the application. Minimal though it is, the application will continue to accumulate functionality like this, and no doubt it will acquire a menu bar, tabs, a preferences dialog, etc over time. Currently, ipythonqt is a glorified frontend launch script (for which I am largely responsible). \n"

    "body": "Ah, good point.  But yes, at the very least a status bar and a simple menu would probably be worth having, just like terminals do.  If you can build any of that go for it, I'm happy to review it.  And we could ultimately promote that as the actual thing users use, while the widget is a library entity for app developers.\n"
