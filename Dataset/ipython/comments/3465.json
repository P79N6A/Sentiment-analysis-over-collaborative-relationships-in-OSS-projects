    "body": "I think there is reason for `bin_dir`. Firstly, this behaviour is in line with how it is done with the other launchers (lines 80-84). \nSecondly, it seems the batch launcher templates are based on the assumption of a shared file system. Specifying a full path to the executable gives us dependable behaviour - e.g. go into whatever virtualenv you want on the machine you run `ipcluster start` on, and the default configuration guarantees you the same python environment on launched nodes. Without the full path I would either have to get into transferring environment variables to get this behaviour (messy) or by default just get the default system python on nodes (flakey). Of course you could get that behaviour if you want by providing a user defined template, I just thought this was the most solid default option.\n\nBtw do you know why the approach in lines 80-84 is taken instead of the approach I'm using for condor? Launching the `ipengine`/`ipcontroller` scripts seems like a better approach to me rather than repeating these what these launchers do manually with the whole `python -c 'from IPython.parallel.apps...` string manipulation stuff, but I thought it would be a bit bold to change it for all the launchers (and I'm not in a position to test PBS etc).\n"

    "body": "> Firstly, this behaviour is in line with how it is done with the other launchers (lines 80-84). \n\nThat's not what those lines do.  Those lines load the ipcontroller/engine startup scripts with the same Python executable as the launcher, specifically so that the PATH to ipcontroller/engine cannot cause confusion by being somewhere weird.  It's quite reasonable for the controller/engine scripts to be in a directory other than the Python executable (in fact, I personally have zero systems where ipengine is in the same dir as python).\n\nFor that reason, I try to use just the base `ipcontroller` when `sys.executable` doesn't make sense (e.g. SSH), and require that people make sure the PATH env makes sense in the batch environment.\n"
