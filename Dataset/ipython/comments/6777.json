    "body": "I confirm that this doesn't fix the issue with tooltips, though I have to make the object considerably larger than in the example before it's a problem. The issue is that inspect requests do not actually use `IPython.lib.pretty` - instead it calls `str(obj)`, and then truncates the string if it's too long. For a sufficiently big object, that's slow, because it has to calculate a huge string, only to throw most of it away. In fact, a set of 6M items on my machine takes longer to convert to str than it does to sort.\n\nThis is still useful when actually displaying these really big objects, but it doesn't address #6736. The good news is that the performance problems seen there are not a regression in this way, so with the status quo restored by #6769, the performance issue for inspect requests is not urgent. If someone wanted to address, that, `IPython.core.oinspect.Inspector.info()` is the place to start looking.\n\nMerging this.\n"
