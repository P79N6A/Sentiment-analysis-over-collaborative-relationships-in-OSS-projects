And we would need some documentation that explain how to create a new translation package. @fperez and I might try to test the framework with spanish and french.

I think that makes sense but I'll investigate what is the state-of-the-art way of translating projects collaboratively these days.\n\nThere are a few reason. First this will give the translators much more freedom than having to go through a Pull request process on the main IPython repository. I can easily imagine that small team might work without wanting to go through github burden of PR and get the validation from someone, then a core member to merge. \n\nSecond, we implicitely maintain **everything** into the main IPython repo. And we cannot commit to maintain German, Chinese... and the rest. Even if at least two of the core contributor are French-speaker this is a heavy task. \n\nIt would bound the translator to make the release at the same time IPython does and/or block us if the translation are not ready. And I believe many people agree to help for translation but do not want  to install bleeding edge unstable version of software. \n\n> Each translation is actually a text file (.po) that is compiled into a binary translation file (.mo). So there won't be a python package that should be imported. It is just a single file that is loaded by the gettext API.\n\nMaking it a python package is just a simple way to find the relevant `.po` and `.mo` files. And also it is easy to have `ipython-tr-TR` depend on IPython itself, you can then \"just\" ask your local user group to install `IPython-en-UK` than to explain they have to download ipython and get the files in the right places.\n\n> So keeping the repositories can be meaningful in terms of access control stuff but I think that the translation files should be shipped with the ipython package itself.\n\nWith devoted people and stable funding we could, but by experience managing/syncing people is hard. I believe that at first having translation in a separate package is better. If it appear that we have   a strong push from community and really good and complete translation, we can always revisit some translations and make them part of the main IPython repo. But is it always easier to bring something in than to pull it out.\n\n> I'll investigate the require.js i18n API.\n\nGreat !\n\n> Documentation is not a problem, I can handle that.\n\nThat would be good !\n\nAlso I saw that : https://www.transifex.com/ for online translation.\n"
