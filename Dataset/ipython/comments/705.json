    "body": "Just a note for anyone interested in helping us with this PR: all feedback is welcome, but obviously on something of this size we're _not_ going to do a line-by-line nitpick. Furthermore, the functionality developed here is so absolutely essential that there's no question this is going in, even though we are fully aware it needs more tuning.\n\nBut if anyone is interested in participating in the review and you spot any problems, by all means point them out so we can fix things before it goes into trunk and gets more users.  Bonus points if you help us out by actually installing it and running it.  You simply need to have [at least tornado 2.0](http://www.tornadoweb.org) installed, and if you are using Firefox, turn on websockets by going to the about:config page, filtering on 'websocket' and turning both options to true by double clicking on them.  Once you do this, you can run it via\n\n<pre>\nipython notebook --pylab=inline\n</pre>\n\n\nor you can omit the `--pylab` support if you don't want plots.  pylab is only used for figures, the notebook works fine without numpy/matplotlib.\n"

I'll have a look to see if I can do something with git\nto remove that file from the DAG altogether (without breaking anything\nelse, of course).
