    "body": "No, and this is how javascript works, we put custom as late as possible on dependencies list, but there always was a small race condition. There is no difference between **reading** the file and **executing** the content of the file. This is what libraries like require try to go around with module definition like : \n\n```\ndefine(...)\n```\n\nTo actually make the module variable evaluation deferred until the dependencies of the module are loaded. This is actually pretty complex to handle especially when things have circular dependencies.\n\nAlso this not that much different from Python, where module usually don't have side effect on import, and you write a `if __name__== '__main__'` in the end which is a clear gross hack. What is above is the same.\n\nThere is also no (easy) way in require to express a depencies in a file which is not yet loaded. \nRequire expect to be able to read a file and figure out dependencies before the file actually does anything.\n\nIt's like looking at the schrodinger cat in the box. Once you look it's dead, unless you hooked him up to a machine to keep it alive. \n"
