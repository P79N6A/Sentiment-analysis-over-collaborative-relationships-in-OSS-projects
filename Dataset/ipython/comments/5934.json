Might a seperate issue but it would probably be good for ipython to clean up defunct JSON files on startup...\n"

But that's just a first idea, there are probably better ways to embed ipython in another app.\n\nFor now I think I can hack it with what you've told me, I'm rather focusing on just making it work at all with minimum amount of new code so I think i am good to go!\n"
