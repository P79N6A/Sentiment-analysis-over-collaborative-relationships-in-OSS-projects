Explanation in the commit message.\r\n\r\nThe takeaway here for future reference is that the only place the frame passed into `interaction` is used is in `Bdb.get_stack`, which walks the stack backwards from the frame and forwards from the traceback to construct the full list of stack frames. The frame can be None and this will still work, but if the traceback and frame don't correspond to the same frame, it will duplicate parts of the stack."
