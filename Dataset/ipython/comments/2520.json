I tested everything again and I confirm that the patch does not do the job for me.\n\nController is an Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.8, python 2.7.3 (compiled myself), OpenSSH_4.3p2.\n\nClient is running openSUSE 12.2, Python 2.7.3, OpenSSH_6.0p1.\n\nOn both is running iPython at commit 6cf3f27. I also need to say that using openssh I can't get the client to establish a connection with the controller. I'm launching the controller with --ssh option, the Client constructor launches a connection but gets stuck (I seems to have something to do with the Client waiting for a password prompt that is not appearing because I am using ssh keys to get in). So I use paramiko (1.8.0) to connect (and the connection works well, I tested).\n\nThanks\n"

I only ever use it with passwordless SSH key login, so that definitely works in some cases.  I wonder what could be going wrong.\n\n> So I use paramiko (1.8.0) to connect (and the connection works well, I tested).\n\nAh, that's important!  I only applied the fix to OpenSSH.
