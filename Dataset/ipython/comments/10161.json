I only meant that dropping support should only be done as part of \"solving a problem\", rather than a \"deadline passed, breaking everything now\" sort of thing. That could be a new feature or bugfix that requires 3.4 syntax, import machinery, etc. As time goes on, the bar for whether a problem is enough to trigger dropping support vs being worked around gets lower and lower. You are right that it's completely subjective, but I trust that we can make these completely subjective decisions together when the time comes."
