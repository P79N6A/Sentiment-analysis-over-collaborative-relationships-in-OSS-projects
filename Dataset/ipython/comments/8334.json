In that case, I'm pretty sure we can't do anything about it, because there's one of two possibilities:\n1. Ctrl-C is queued behind the input going through the pty, so it won't even send the SIGINT until the input has finished.\n2. It sends SIGINT immediately, bypassing the input buffer, but that only gets you a new prompt, and then the input carries on.\n\nI'm not sure which it is, but in either case I don't think we can do anything about it.\n"

    "body": "I don't think there's a practical way to ask the user to confirm anything when stdin is still being flooded with incoming input. And even if there was, we can't stop that input coming through, though not trying to run it might make it go through a bit faster.\n\nIn general, I'm very wary of trying to guess what the user is doing and behave differently based on that guess, even when it's technically possible to do so. It makes the software more complex, less predictable and harder to test.\n\nI remember using a website that prevented me from copy-pasting values into an HTML form (because computers can't be trusted, I guess) by timing how quickly successive characters were entered. My normal typing speed, which is nothing remarkable, was enough to make it think I was using the clipboard, so I had to force myself to type slowly to stop it resetting the field. This type of interface is very hard to do well, and utterly infuriating when done badly.\n"
