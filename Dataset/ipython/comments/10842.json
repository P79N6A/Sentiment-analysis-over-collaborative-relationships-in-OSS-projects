    "body": "Windows 10, I always get notifications telling me to start defender (separate issue) but can't imagine that's the problem. Have only tried with chrome with seems to work for my classmates. It's in my SSD (C://Users/me) although the files I'm trying to open are in a folder right off of the C drive. Sometimes my cpu takes longer to launch local servers and other python-related materials, although jupyter notebook is completely shot. For example, I can execute jupyter --version fine but jupyter notebook --version is the same problem. The only reason I know it works somehow is because I've left my cpu running for a while and come back to discover notebook had launched into chrome, although it definitely doesn't happen within 20 minutes. Have tried reinstalling Anaconda (64 bit) twice now, same issues. Not sure if 32 bit will make a difference. Thanks for your help."
