    "body": "Excellent project to describe how IPython works! I wish this had existed 4 months ago when I started working on our kernel :)\n\nAs I briefly described in a talk ref1 (halfway down), \"IPython\" is actually 5 different things:\n1. A \"kernel\" API for interpreting: expressions and \"magics\" meta-commands\n2. A \"frontend\" API for talking to a kernel (console, qtconsole, and notebook)\n3. The notebook frontend API for web/widgets for language + web interaction\n4. A JSON socket-based message-passing API and implementation for communication\n5. A program that manages all of the above, ipython\n\nSix, actually:\n1. An API for running distributed/parallel code\n\nI think a good overview would start with the big picture, and then dive into each one of these as if they were different projects. It would be great if details from each are cleanly separated from the others. \n\nref1 - http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/bitbucket.org/ipre/calico/raw/master/notebooks/SIGCSE/SIGCSE%20ICalico.ipynb\n"
