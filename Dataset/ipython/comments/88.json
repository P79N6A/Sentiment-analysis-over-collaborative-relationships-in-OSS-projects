It's something related to readline, and we disabled a line of the configuration, which is why you no longer get the spaces.\n\nI'm afraid I can't replicate the crash. What system are you on? What's your terminal encoding? Can you check what range of characters cause it? If you've customised your .inputrc file, can you remove it so you're using a default readline config (you might need to restart your terminal after doing that)? If it still fails, can you try commenting out the lines 237-252 of IPython/core/interactiveshell.py, and see which, if any, are linked to the problem? Thanks.\n"

Now that we no longer bind that keyseq, the crash does not occur, at least not on my UTF8 OSX machine (apparently identical to rspeer), nor on my UTF8 Linux system.\n\nIf anyone does, however, bind `\\xe9` (which is 'é') to any command or macro, they will likely encounter this error.\n"

Sorry I misunderstood your comment.\n\nI don't have LC_ALL set anywhere, but if the Terminal config option 'Set locale environment variables on startup' is checked (it is checked by default), then `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`, and IPython's unicode behavior appears exactly as it should.\n\nCan you describe what you mean by 'inconsistent', and can you compare IPython's behavior to Python's?\n\nIf that box is unchecked, or I otherwise override LANG or LC_ALL to 'C' or blank, or I ssh to the machine, then stdin/out get 'ascii' as their encoding, and the behavior doesn't seem inconsistent, though I do get ASCII encode errors if I try to print unicode characters, and I can't type or paste unicode characters at all. But this is exactly right if stdin/out are ASCII, and not different from Python's own behavior, or even bash, if they are started in an environment with `LC_ALL=C`.\n\nHowever, I still can't make this bug occur with any combination of terminals and environment variables I've tried yet.\n"
