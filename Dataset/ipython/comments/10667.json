    "body": "Hi @matthewwardrop, \r\n\r\nWhat you ask is a bit tough. The problem is that the frontend is not aware that `%%whatver` are magics, as far as it knows these are opaque lob of text. We did hardcode some of this knowledge when the notebook was still part of IPython , but we are moving away from that. So we will need to rethink the architecture a bit to have way to get this information through. Though I agree it would be a nice thing. "
