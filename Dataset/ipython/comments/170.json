    "body": "I tested on my Ubuntu machine (apt installed Qt/PyQt), and it does html by default, not htm I don't know why yours would be different.\n\nI just changed how it works a little bit.  All options are in one dialog, like a normal 'Save As...'.  After some testing, now it accepts standard html/htm and xhtml/xml extensions, and appends the default suffix (html or xhtml) if no suffix or a different suffix is given.  This doesn't allow _any_ extensions, but it behaves better than I had it at first.\n\nMaking it a single dialog means you can have a meaningful keyboard shortcut (Save default), which I also added.\n\nAdding '_' back to the filters will allow using any extension, but turns off Qt's addition of the default suffix when there's no extension specified.  I explored it, and didn't see an easy way to nicely handle collision detection and only add the suffix when *no_ extension is given while accepting any other extensions.\n\nFor instance, if you had:\nsave as 'f2' really meaning 'f2.html', and both 'f2' and 'f2.html' existed, you would get notified of both collisions.  I can turn off Qt's collision detection and only use my own, but the native dialog is cleaner and preferable.\n\nI also added the warning dialog when an export subroutine raises an error, for instance if fname_files is a file and not a dir.\n"

I guess this is a problem with having two export modes for html.\n\nWhat about having the inline/external question be a secondary pop-up, like you see when you save a PNG/JPEG from something like Photoshop?  The normal model for that is: file dialog asks what file you want. After selecting the file, if the filetype has extra options, launch new dialog for those settings.\nThat should resolve the more important issue. \n\nIt's disappointing that Qt doesn't work well with the native KDE dialog.  It's always better to use native when possible.\n"
