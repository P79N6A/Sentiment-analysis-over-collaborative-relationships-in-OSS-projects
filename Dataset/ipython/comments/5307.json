I would like to add a theme once IPython / nbviewer supports that, as I do need some additional CSS for that, but I don't know how I would make a PR for that since the support isn't there yet (right?). I would also like to have IHaskell things somewhat more visible on nbviewer homepage or something if there's space and that's possible, but I also don't know how I would make a PR for that.\n\nAnyway, let me know if either of these is possible and what I should do to achieve them. However, since they're not IPython issues or bugs, I think it's fairly reasonable to go ahead and close the issue regardless, and I'll reopen it with a PR if I have one.\n"
