    "body": "I'd much rather see if we can do this cleanly with subprocess.  I can't really remember a specific reason for using os.system instead of subprocess at the time, other than possibly inertia from older code.\n\nSo my suggestion for this PR is to _not_ merge it as-is, but instead to try to see if replacing that call with a subprocess one does the job.  We'll need to run the test suite in all OSes before merging, but that would be a cleaner solution in the long run.\n\nAnd @jdmarch, in general I also prefer not having generic 'cleanup' commits of whitespace.  It's fine to clean up a few lines around stuff that's being worked on, but having dedicated whitespace cleanup commits just adds noise.  It's very difficult to get everyone to configure all possible editors in tip-top perfect whitespace compliance shape, and I'd rather not worry too much about that stuff.  We just live with a little bit of whitespace mess here and there :)\n"
