    "body": "`sudo pip install tornado` isn't a great idea, but in all likelihood it won't cause serious breakage. The reasons to avoid using `sudo pip` are:\n- If you install newer versions of modules that system stuff depends on, that system stuff might be broken. e.g. at one point, installing a newer version of `requests` broke pip on Debian systems. This probably isn't an issue for tornado, as not many system components depend on a web framework (yet).\n- Python packages aren't as trusted as Debian packages, so you shouldn't install them as root. This is true, but on a single user machine, making a special effort to protect root is [kind of ridiculous](https://xkcd.com/1200/).\n\nIf you've done `sudo pip install ...`, later doing `sudo apt-get reinstall ...` won't change anything: apt installs into `/usr`, pip into `/usr/local`. Apt will reinstall its files, and the files pip installed will still be there, and still take precedence. If you want to undo `sudo pip install ...`, you should `sudo pip uninstall ...`.\n\nVirtualenv is handy when you want to test out different versions of things, e.g. to test the development version without overwriting your install of the stable version. But for day to day work, I don't bother with them. Instead I use `pip install --user ...` which installs packages in my home directory.\n"

    "body": "This is a known and relatively common bug in setuptools seen on Linux. Setuptools can create a file called `easy-install.pth`, typically in `/usr/local/lib/pythonX.Y/dist-packages/easy-install.pth`. Bugs in setuptools can cause it to add `/usr/lib/pythonX.Y/dist-packages` to this file, corrupting the sys.path priority. The result being that apt-installed packages end up being imported, no matter what else has been installed in a higher priority location. If you see `/usr/lib/.../dist-packages` in easy-install.pth, this is the bug and the line should be removed from the .pth file.\n\nThe bug has since been fixed in setuptools, I believe, so it should only be an issue if you are using (or have ever used) outdated pip/setuptools. One thing to be sure of: make sure you always have up-to-date setuptools and pip. Even if you have installed them with apt, the _very first thing_ you should do is `pip install --upgrade setuptools pip`.\n"
