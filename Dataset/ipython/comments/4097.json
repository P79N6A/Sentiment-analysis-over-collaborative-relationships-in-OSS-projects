It seems that `counter-increment: section` is not working.\n\nHowever, I have checked that the same CSS does work correctly at http://jsfiddle.net/\n(Possibly overkill ;) Though it is not clear to me if `jsfiddle` uses my browser's CSS mechanism, or if it's running somewhere else.)\n\nI am a CSS beginner, so I really am at a loss to understand what might be happening here.\nI used Chrome developer tools to check what CSS was being applied and apparently it is correct (e.g. the `h2:before` is supposedly being processed). Is there a way to get even further in to see what calculations are being done, etc.?\n\nThe only thing I could guess is that the `<h2>` tags are quite buried inside a lot of other stuff and maybe this is somehow \"confusing\" the browser. (Could it be to do with those paragraph marks, for example?)\n\nIt would be _really_ great to have this feature working, and it is almost there...\n\nPS: Is it possible to make CSS variants like this available as some kind of extension?\nWould it be acceptable to make it available as `sec-numbering.css` and then suggest to use `@import` in `custom.css`? Or is there a more sensible way to do it?\n\nPinging any CSS expert out there, for example @Carreau ...\n"
