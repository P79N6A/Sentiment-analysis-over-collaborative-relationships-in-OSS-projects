    "body": "The issue is that with prompt toolkit stdout in particular is more than a stream, as you literally draw/erase/redraw on the screen, and as it uses an eventloop and async completions, you cannot consider the stdin/out/err to be enough to know the current state. \n\nSo you will (likely) need to hook into the prompt_toolkit and overwrite the vt100-input/output and/or the windows ones. \n\nWe most-likely will need extra hooks to set that up in IPython at startup. \n"
