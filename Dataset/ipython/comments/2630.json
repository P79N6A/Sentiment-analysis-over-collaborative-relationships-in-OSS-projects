    "body": "I can confirm this behavior - not sure if we should make figsize available in both cases or neither case.\n\n@fperez wrote that code almost exactly a year ago, but he'll have very limited connectivity in the coming weeks.\n\nThe relevant lines are in [`IPython/core/pylabtools.py:301-302`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/pylabtools.py#L301-L302).\n\nI'd actually prefer to move this code out to matplotlib - because we don't want to start creating asymmetries where the code will run in IPython but not in Python, since by also attaching `figsize` to `plt.figsize` we are wrongly giving the impressions to users of the `plt` interface that `figsize` is a standard method there.\n"
