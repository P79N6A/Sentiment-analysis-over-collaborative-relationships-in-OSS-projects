    "body": "Recently with @stefanv we were talking about this, and wondering if it wouldn't be a good idea to move to x.y notebook format identifiers, with the idea that we'd only increment x when the client simply couldn't read the new format _at all_, while y would be incremented for changes that might result in loss of formatting or simplified structure from earlier clients, but that could still be read.  \n\nFor example, the introduction of new cell types could be considered a `y+=1`-type increment, as an x.y client could read a x.{y+1} notebook and simply leave all cells of unknown type marked as raw (with a suitable warning).  That would in many cases be an acceptable solution for a user who only wants to be able to get to the code.  Thoughts?\n"
