    "body": "Are you connecting to MongoDB directly (i.e. with a PyMongo Connection as opposed to an `IPython.parallel.controller.mongodb.MongoDB` object)?  \nYou must be careful, because all direct MongoDB queries include the `_id` key (just like all IPython db queries include msg_id), so if you are explicitly querying MongoDB you must scrub the `_id` after your queries (our MongoDB backend object does this).\n\nIf you stick a print statement (`print msg['header']`) in `Session.serialize`, you will see where the bad `_id` object is getting inserted.  I presume it's getting in the subheader by way of targets, etc. (though possibly the msg_id?).\n"
