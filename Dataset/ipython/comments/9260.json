It's a one line change in ipapp to use the old TerminalInteractiveShell class for now.\n\nIs this prompted by a problem in the new interface?

I can likely do it without that, But I'll have to understand how prompt toolkit work. Also the Prompt toolkit interface does not seem to support LightBG and Linux Color (which map terminal theming by using short ansi sequence) which is super painful as current theme hurt my eyes. And without this feature I would likely not want to use the prompt toolkit interface. \n"

Run `list(pygments.styles.get_all_styles())` to see the options.\n\nI tried to make the default theme visible on both light and dark terminals (there's no way to detect which we're on). I tested it on both backgrounds on my machines, but it's probably going to look a bit different in different terminal emulators. Obviously we can do further tweaking, but we need to test in both: we can't just optimise for one background and make it illegible in the other.\n\nI also know that the compromises to make it work in both don't make it great in either, which is why I made sure it's easy to select other themes.\n"
