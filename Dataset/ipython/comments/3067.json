If it's plain old `ipython3` at the command-line, there is no reasonable mechanism for this to be due to IPython, as it lacks a single line of compiled code.  The first step to check out would be doing the same steps in a regular Python session.\n"

The type object pygit generates seems to be severely broken.  This comes up in IPython, because it attempts to inspect the type of an object when you ask to display it in order to select pretty-printers.\n"
