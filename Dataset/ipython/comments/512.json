    "body": "The hook in `zmq.displayhook` is a generic one that could be used any time you want to forward display over zeromq.  The hook in `zmq.zmqshell` is a subclass that adds the extra bits an `InteractiveShell` expects.\n\nI don't see a reason not to put them both in zmq.displayhook.  I wouldn't choose RichDisplayHook as the name for the InteractiveShell-bound one. Maybe ZMQDisplayHook and ZMQShellDisplayHook, since the latter is for use in the ZMQShell?\n"
