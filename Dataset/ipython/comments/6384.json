I didn't notice this strange behavior before, but was able to reproduce it in IPython 3.\n\nI did some work in exception formatting code in ipython and I think that I can fix this issue too.\n\nIs there anyone thinking that this particular behavior should stay as it is now?\n"

It's just a question of what the IPython display for an object that has no working `__repr__` should be. That code can be changed to include the traceback, but I'm not sure it can be changed to allow the exception to just raise.\n"
