    "body": "> I think main.js should not depend on the custom.js, this make load custom.js first. but in custom.js, IPython has not been set up. I hope to have a better solution\n\nBut if you don't require it, then nothing loads it. And in any case we need predetermine place to call it.\n\nI'm would prefer to actually have custom.js define a module with specific function that get called like:\n\n```\ndefine(function(require){\n  return { notebook_init : function(){...},\n    dashboard_init: function(){ ...},\n }\n})\n```\n\nBut it did not get much traction.\n"
