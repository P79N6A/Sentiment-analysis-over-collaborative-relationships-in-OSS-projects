    "body": "Well unfortunately the update I wrote (deleted in the meanwhile) was really confusing :confused: \nIf I remember correctly, `init_printing()` didn't work with sympy 0.7.2, here a `init_printing(use_latex=True)` was necessary. With 0.7.3 everything works fine, so I guess it is ok to close this, as 0.7.3 was released about 7 month ago.\n"
