    "body": "Hi there, thanks for you bug report. \r\n\r\n`debug` is a magic, and magics apply on strings not necessarily python code. There is then nothing smart about trying to debug multi line statement. \r\n\r\nIn _some_ case we manage to detect that bare statement are magic, but we recommend to always use `%debug` (single line), or `%%debug` all cells.\r\n\r\nIn your `In[3]` the IPython parser cannot figure out that debug is a magic, and even though would apply it only to the line on which debug is. That is to say:\r\n\r\n```\r\nget_ipython().magic('debug', 'foo(')\r\n    10\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is invalid syntax.\r\n\r\nYou can force the evaluation of a multiline magic with `%%`\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [3]: %%debug\r\n   ...: foo(\r\n   ...:    10\r\n   ...: )\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith `%%debug` on its own line. Which  will work.\r\n\r\n"
