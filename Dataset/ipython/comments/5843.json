I would like folks to test it - I was able to reproduce the scrollbar bad behavior, and removing this CSS did fix it, but I'm not entirely certain about the scope of affected cases. It doesn't appear that flexbox is relevant to these scrollbar issues at all.\n\nAs for the flexbox problems, I can't seem to replicate them in either Firefox or Chrome. Can you provide a test case that still reproduces the issue in master? Neither the steps in #5675 nor in #5612 produce empty space in master.\n"
