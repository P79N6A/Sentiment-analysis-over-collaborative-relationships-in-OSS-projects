Instead there could be a tuple helper property.  The reasoning is that `link` and `dlink`, which act on traitlets, will be much more usefull if the traits are individual integers (so you can link them to individual widgets or traits).  Could you try implementing it this way?\n"

    "body": "@jdfreder There are several possible routes - can you indicate which would be preferable?\n\n`upper` and `lower` become scalar traits, and:\n- `value` is a property. This breaks `interact()` as noted above, since it doesn't know either how to 1) handle multiple significant traits from one widget, or 2) doesn't get `on_trait_change` callbacks if `value` is a property rather than a trait. Fixing this would require either wider modification to widgets/`interact()` to allow them to inform the method about how to handle their values, or special-casing for this specific widget.\n- `value` is also a trait, and is kept two-way synchronised with `upper` and `lower`. Since `link` doesn't handle joining dissimilar traits (scalar <-> tuple element) either much of the functionality needs to be duplicated in the slider class, or `link` extended to handle this case.\n- `value` is also a trait, but synchronisation is only one-way between `value` and `upper`/`lower` - this is easy but either way round seems a bit counter-intuitive.\n"

    "body": "I'm working on this, but there are some tricky issues around multiple traits.\n\nThe above examples assume you don't do any mutation of the value provided to `_X_changed`, however, if like this case you want to validate new values against eg, min and max. This can lead to messy recursion since it doesn't appear possible to change multiple traits atomically without more callbacks being fired.\n\n```\nirsw = IntRangeSliderWidget(min=0, max=100, lower=25, upper=75)\nirsw.value = (5, 10)\ncalls _value_changed(new=(5, 10))\ncalls _upper_changed(new=10)\ncalls _lower_changed(new=5)\netc...\n```\n\nUnless we change the order of assignments each time, we may get a temporary invalid state `(lower=25, upper=10)`. This makes doing any validation difficult, since if a user had tried to manually set that state I would want to raise an error, but not if it is a intermediate state - this can be handled with a `updating` flag to stop any more validation occurring until the initial callback completes, but I can't stop any other watcher getting these intermediate states, which likely violate their assumptions and will cause errors.\n\nThis can be seen with the existing (non-range) slider widget, albeit in a slightly more contrived way:\n\n```\nisw = IntSliderWidget(min=0, max=100, value=50)\nisw.on_trait_change(watcher)\nisw.value = -5\n```\n\n`watcher` will be called first with `value=-5`, and then with `value=0` after `IntSliderWidget._validate` has run.\n\nIs there any way to either:\n- Catch a trait change before `HasTraits._notify_change` gets called, so the value can be modified without triggering multiple callbacks?\n- Declare a set of assignments atomic and suppress callbacks until they are all changed - perhaps like\n  \n  with traits.Atomic():\n      self.value = low, high\n      self.lower = low\n      self.upper = high\n"
