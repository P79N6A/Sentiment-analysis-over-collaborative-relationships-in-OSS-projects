    "body": "Yep, that last comment was me.\n\nThe test I linked to calls the %profile magic in a subprocess, but it fails because `ipexec_validate` doesn't like the warning that is printed to stderr. But the test doesn't need to use that specific magic command: any magic command will do so long as it has consistent output. I suggested `%xmode plain` as a magic command you could use. If you tweak that test to use that magic, it should pass.\n"
