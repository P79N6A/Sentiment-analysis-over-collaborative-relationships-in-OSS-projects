It appears that pyqt is causing the issue to happen because of a Qt.QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv) call which was being executed in a rogue startup script.\n\nWeird that 1.2 series didnt seem to mind while 2.x+ did.\n\nApologies for the false alarm, I'll def make sure to dbl check that PYTHONSTARTUP is unset when hunting these sort of issues down.\n"
