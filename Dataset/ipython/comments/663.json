With Python 3, it now installs setuptools-style entry points as `ipython3` etc. I've patched `simplegeneric` and sent the diff upstream, but not heard anything yet.\n\nBefore merging, we should consider the failing test for splitting user input containing unicode (I think it's alright to change the test, but I'm not sure why it was written).\n\nOther questions I haven't yet addressed, but needn't block merging this: I need to work out a way to convert doctests, which currently cause a lot of failures. Pexpect will need some patches to work in Python 3. We should also give a bit of thought to how the `python3` profile should fit in.\n"

In master, we get, correctly:\n\n<pre>\nIn [5]: from IPython.core import inputsplitter as isp\n\nIn [6]: isp.split_user_input(u'Pérez Fernando')\nOut[6]: (u'', '', u'', u'P\\xe9rez Fernando')\n</pre>\n\n\nbut with these changes, we get:\n\n<pre>\nIn [1]: from IPython.core import inputsplitter as isp\n\nIn [2]: isp.split_user_input(u'Pérez Fernando')\nOut[2]: (u'', '', u'P', u'\\xe9rez Fernando')\n</pre>\n\n\nSo the input is definitely being incorrectly split, because the third output value should be an empty string and we're getting a 'P' in there.\n\nI'm too tired to dig into this one, but we do need to fix this one before merging, not changing the test.

But it didn't do this very well, so `x =1` would be split, but `x=1` wouldn't. I tweaked the regex a bit so that it behaved more consistently. So when presented with `u'Pérez Fernando'`, it breaks out `P` as the first valid Python identifier. Is there some better definition of how it should behave?\n"

It's a fairly large set of changes, but it will make py3 support much easier in the future, and I think Thomas did a great job of isolating the compatibility hacks to very well-defined locations.

I hope having this now in trunk will make your life significantly easier re. py3 support.  Please do yell at us if you see us doing things that make py3 support harder in master: since we don't use it regularly, we tend to slip up easily :)\n"

I'll merge right away if I get an okay, as it's a very serious issue.\n"
