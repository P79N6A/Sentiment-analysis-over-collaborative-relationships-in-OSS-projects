    "body": "Hi there. \r\n\r\nThanks for the question. \r\n\r\nFirst you have to understand that the kernel does not know much about the document itself, any change in IPython are as agnostic as possible to the frontend. If there are reference remaining it's for legacy reason. \r\n\r\nSecond\r\n\r\nThere is no Header cell, only markdown cell that starts with `#`s.\r\nI dont' believe there is any way from with the kernel to create a new markdown cells that will work reliably. You can modify the above to create a 'text' cell I believe, but that will only work in old classic notebook. "
