I'm going to verify that it's no longer a problem on old versions of FF and Chrome.\n\nOn a good note, I did end up exploring the new standard - `display: flex` and adding support to our existing flexible box model less.  (see e829efe).\n\nOfficial doc: http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-flexbox/\nEasier to read doc: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/-moz-box-pack\n\nThis new implementation seems to fix the problem on the new Chrome and FF installations both.  \n\nhttp://caniuse.com/flexbox shows a chart of which web browsers support this (ones with special prefixes, such as `-moz` and `-ms` don't).  The way I added support for `display: flex` _should_ be backwards compatible.  Obviously, doing things this way will only fix the problem on modern copies of FF (~halfway through 2013 and later).  People with older FF copies will still be missing a scrollbar.\n\nPing @ellisonbg because I was talking to him about this at lunch.\n"
