I'll merge now, but I want to make a suggestion: @minrk, with just adding a tiny bit of explanatory text (a title and a short paragraph before each cell should suffice), [your progressbar notebook](https://gist.github.com/2347016) should really go into the doc examples!  It's a great little illustration of how to use the system which I'm sure many people will find useful.\n\nI won't delay this PR on that alone, esp. since #1548 depends on this one, so I'll merge now.  Great work!!\n"
