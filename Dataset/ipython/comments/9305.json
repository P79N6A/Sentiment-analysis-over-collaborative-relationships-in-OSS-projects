    "body": "Hi there, \n\nwelcome to GitHub, I see this is your first contribution !\n\nYou do not **need** to patch IPython to have a new magic, you can just publish your own package on PyPI. See for example one of [mine](https://github.com/Carreau/cffi_magic/blob/master/cffi_magic/__init__.py). (Which might not have the  best practices though)\n\nCreating your own package is not that hard, and it allows you to publish it at your own rythme, and make the magic available on older version of IPython, without getting blocked by our slow release schedule. \n\n(I would suggest looking at [flit](http://flit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) which is not as flexible as normal setup.py but much simpler) \n\nYou can in particular see [our docs](http://ipython.readthedocs.org/en/stable/config/custommagics.html) also on how to do a custom magic, and use `%load_extension` to load it. \n\nWe usually prefer for extension to live (a bit) in their own package for a bit, and then, once they mature, and are stable enough, potentially migrate them in IPython itself (though extension tend to go the other way, because users want updates every month instead of every year). \n\nDo you feel like creating your own package ? We can help you with that too if you are still uncomfortable. \n\nI'll still review this code  and put comment inline if necessary. \n"

    "body": "Hi Matthias , \nThanks for your help in advance ! \nI was able to get a couple of things going1. I created a magic functionality as a Class as specified in  custommagics documentation  and using your repository as reference. Here is the link to my Git repo: https://github.com/vegabondx/savef. I have verified that if i run the file as %run savef.py it loads the magic function correctly. \n2. I was also able to make a PyPi package using flit command , again utilizing your repo as reference. I was able to create a package. \nHowever when I install the package , it does not \"install\" savef functionality in ipython by default. However when i do the following it works\n\n```\nIn [2]: %savef\nERROR:root:Line magic function `%savef` not found.\nIn [3]: %load_ext savef\nThe savef module is not an IPython extension.\nIn [4]: %savef -f\nStarting python file: `temp.py`\n```\n\n( i.e. working properly ) \n\nCould you let me know what I may be missing here ? Also is there any stylistic improvements I should make ? \n"
