    "body": "The object implements a .getdoc() method. `IPython.core.oinspect.getdoc()` reckons that, if an object has a .getdoc() method as well as a normal docstring, the result of calling it should be treated as extra information, and concatenated together.\n\nAre there actually any cases where .getdoc() adds info to the normal docstring, or can we simplify it to only check .getdoc() if it doesn't get a normal docstring. Otherwise, one possible way round this is to use `textwrap.dedent`, then compare the two, and only show both if they differ. Or perhaps, if they're both over a certain length, only show one.\n"
