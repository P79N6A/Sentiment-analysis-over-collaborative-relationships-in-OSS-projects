We expect people that hack from master to follow the annouced for now, and it's explained on [our blog post](http://blog.jupyter.org/2015/04/15/the-big-split/).\n\nTraitlets should be release soonish enough that we don't need to update the readme for that. Or it will become outdated.\n\nThanks for the question though. \n"
