    "body": "I think @dgleich is right that fsync() is necessary, and I've added that to atomic_writing.\n\nThis will block the server while fsync() finishes. From what I've read, this is typically milliseconds, but if the disk is very busy, it could stretch to a few seconds. Some battery-conserving power management settings also try to keep the hard drive spun down most of the time. Explicitly fsync-ing presumably disrupts that, forcing the disk to spin up. With a single notebook open, the autosave interval is probably long enough not to be a problem, but if you have several open, it may start to be an issue.\n\nShould we add an option to disable fsync, or atomic save in general? I started typing that we probably don't need one, because all editors must face this, and I've never seen an option for it. But now I go looking, Geany, Sublime 3 and TextMate all do have options to disable atomic save - although they tend to be in 'advanced' sections of the config, understandably.\n"

We don't think an option to disable atomic save is necessary - people concerned about e.g. wear on flash storage can disable autosave in the JS.\n\nAlso, it's apparently impossible to guarantee that data actually hits permanent storage, because of all the layers of caching involved, some of which are beyond application control. This is the best we can do from application code, and I think it should deal with the truncation on a full disk that we discussed. @ivanov plans to set up a docker container to check that.\n"
