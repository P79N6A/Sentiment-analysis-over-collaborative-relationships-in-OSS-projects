    "body": "BTW, regarding [William's comment](http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/12719#comment:49), that was not a mistake or omission: it was a very deliberate choice we made after lots of thought.  Given that we manage numbered prompts and history, and that matplotlib produces so many plots as side effects, after much experimentation we found it worked much better to only execute with 'interactive' mode the _last_ block.\n\nSage doesn't distinguish stdout from python sys.displayhook, so the opposite behavior may be more desirable, but we actually consider that a 'bad design choice' of sage, because it loses an important distinction and the cache management of output history.\n\nSo in summary: our choice is actually sensible and consistent given IPython's internal design :)\n"

Reposting here just in case you don't have a trac account:\n\nFernando: I looked in the IPython source, and it seems that IPython is a little more subtle than mentioned above. By default, it only executes the last block as interactive (compile in 'single' mode) if it is an expression. In Sage, we (by default) execute the last block always in 'single' mode. I think that is the difference here.\n\nGiven that (and if I understood correctly), could you explain again your reasoning for choosing to not compile in 'single' mode if it isn't an expression?\n"

    "body": "Precisely so that if the last block has a loop, it doesn't produce multiple `Out [NN]` cells.  We want to keep a one-to-one mapping between a cell and its output.  For example it's quite common to write code like:\n\n``` python\nfor i in x:\n  plot(x[i], label='blah_i')\n```\n\nIf we compile that as 'single', we'd get all the Matplotlib line collection results piling up at the bottom, one for each plot call.\n\nWe played a _lot_ with various options, and settled on this behavior after much experimentation.  After 2 years of using it, I remain convinced it's the right solution _for us_.  Not to say that Sage can't make a different choice that works better for you guys, of course!\n"
