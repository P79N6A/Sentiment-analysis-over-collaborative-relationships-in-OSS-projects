Thanks for kicking this off. In order to keep traffic moving in the right direction, a human based link is our current only answer with the wiki tooling.\r\n\r\nWe also need to move the [\"IPython kernels\"](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages) (rename to Jupyter kernels) and [\"URL Mapping\"](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Dev:-URL-mapping-of-IPython-notebook) (rename to Jupyter Notebook API) pages. Should we establish these wiki pages on jupyter/jupyter?"

    "body": "Thanks @rgbkrk, good point about the other pages we need to keep in mind. Can you think of any others?  This point reinforces my thought that we should bite the bullet and do the move, and include all relevant pages that are jupyter-generic (and I agree that they should move to the jupyter/jupyter wiki).  While wikis are an imperfect tool and they get messy/weedy over time, they are still very valuable for this kind of table/list information that needs tons of very small updates from a wide range of people with minimal effort.  I'm convinced if we had those tables in our static docs, they would see a fraction of the contributions, as the barrier would be too high."

I've been using Jupyter notebook as much as possible when talking about the project, but keeping \"IPython Notebook\" as a valid term referring to a notebook that uses the IPython kernel, as opposed to an \"IJulia Notebook\", which specifies that it uses the IJulia kernel, etc."

    "body": "@minrk, I agree with you and often follow the same pattern :)\r\n\r\nIt seems everyone's happy with this.  I only have one question before we close: I think the new page should be titled simply \"A gallery of interesting Jupyter Notebooks\", *without* IPython in that name, using IPython only in the body.  Before we were doing both as a way to try to bridge from the old IPython wiki, but if we're going to clean this up, let's just do it right once and for all...  The overall name should be \"Jupyter notebooks\" (since those listed can be in any language, even if there's a preponderance of IPython ones), and we can mention IPython in the body.\r\n\r\nFeel free to emojivote this, and we can wrap it up!"
