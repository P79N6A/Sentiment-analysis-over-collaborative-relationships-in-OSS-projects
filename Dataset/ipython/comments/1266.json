    "body": "After some elaborate exploration, I am fairly confident that it is indeed the low-level send of the large message part in libzmq that is hanging for periods of time.  It's _possible_ this is related to the GIL, but only if I misunderstand the GIL quite a bit (entirely possible).  I have run it on three Linux machines without being able to reproduce the delay.  I have reproduced it on my other mac (different OS version, different Python version), so it could be a kqueue vs epoll issue (underlying polling implementation in libzmq), or it could actually be an issue in the OS itself somehow, who knows.\n\n[The script I used](https://gist.github.com/1618527) echoes a 1MB array a couple thousand times, and seems to run into the issue on about 1% of calls.  This script was originally written to test the memory performance of the db backends, and is what prompted me to add the `--nodb` flag, since the db backends are so slow.\n"
