    "body": "To be more specific, there's a cache of importable modules, because finding them all every time is too slow for tab completion. The magic command @bfroehle gave clears the cache.\n\nI suppose we could have separate caches for Python 2 and 3, but it goes deeper than that - there might be modules specific to a particular virtualenv, or a particular working directory, not to mention that you could have your ipython directory synced between separate computers. But for the most part, the single shared cache works well enough that it's not worth the added complexity to deal with the corner cases.\n"

This would take care of multiple python versions as well as virtualenvs.  The modules defined in the current folder (which do not appear in autocompletion currently) would be added separately; hopefully that shouldn't take too long.\nOne could even limit the size of the cache (I don't think people will regularly use 10 different PYTHONPATHs... correct me if I'm wrong).\n"

    "body": "Hmm, keying by sys.path is pretty elegant. Are you interested in implementing that and creating a pull request?\n\nExamining the working directory separately might make sense, although I'd want to do some performance tests - including on spinning iron drives, not just SSDs. Then again, we tab complete to file names in the local directory, so filtering those by a simple importability criterion ought to be OK.\n\nPeople who make heavy use of virtualenv may well have more than 10 environments, but limiting the size might still work if there's an effective fallback.\n\nIt would also need some thinking about user interface - e.g. if I install a new module system-wide, do I have to do `%rehashx` in each environment separately before I can get tab completions on it? Perhaps it's better to keep a cache for each entry in sys.path, and merge the relevant ones when tab completions are required? That would also reduce redundant storage.\n"
