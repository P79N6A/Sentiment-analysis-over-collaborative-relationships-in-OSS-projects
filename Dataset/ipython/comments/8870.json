    "body": "When you paste into the terminal, it emulates typing every character, which can get messed up by the autoindent logic. For plain terminals, it's definitely preferable to use `%paste`, which reads from the clipboard directly, then executes the code. If you still want to paste into the terminal, then it's best to use `%cpaste`, which turns off some of the input processing.\n\nWhen you paste, can you make the very first line a print statement, to verify that it's actually getting hung up pasting, and not during the execution of some of the code?\n"
