We can put an entry in the FAQ about it, I guess, so people find it more easily.\n\nIn that case it seems we can close this one, right?

If I run 2to3 manually, I'd need to edit `setup.py` to avoid running it again.

    "body": "I can't replicate any problems with `from . import` with Python 3.1.4 on Ubuntu. It's possible that one of the bugfix releases of 3.1 fixed this - #1197 reported it on 3.1.2, #1251 doesn't specify a version. Unless we get evidence that something else is causing it, I'm considering this resolved. Unfortunately, distributions (at least Debian/Ubuntu) haven't apparently picked up the bugfix releases, but I don't think we need to work around that for a handful of users.\n\nI've skipped one unit test for Python 3.1 - I've checked that what it tests works interactively, and I won't waste time debugging the test (which passes on the other versions). I don't think there were any major changes to the language between 3.1 and 3.2, and now we've got ShiningPanda running our tests, I imagine it will take minimal effort to keep it in working order until the next release.\n"
