    "body": "The comms error is triggered when a figure is closed an believe that it is a bug on the matplotlib side. It seems to happen because we don't close the connection on both the python and javascript side. We should fix that but at this stage the error is relatively harmless. \n\n@minrk is right. You should expect the nbagg backend to mimic a GUI backend and not the inline backend. New plot lines are added to an old figure unless you explicitly create a new figure using plt.figure() etc.\n"
