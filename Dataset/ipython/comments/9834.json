Not that I can say that it does anything, but it doesn't choke.\r\nIf they wanted to provide a clear and meaningful error message then they might have said something like:\r\nUnknownBackend: No event loop integration for 'inline'. Instead of 'inline' try using one of the supported event loops: qt, qt4, qt5, gtk, gtk2, gtk3, tk, wx, pyglet, glut, osx"
