    "body": "As I said above, if you want to use Python 3 and 2 next to each other you need to use envs.\r\nSee [conda envs](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html).\r\n\r\nWether you want to use anaconda2 or anaconda3 is up to you. You can't really use both anaconda at the same time. Likely the one you installed most recently will take precedence. There is no _need_ to uninstall, but one will just be unavailable.\r\n\r\nThe major difference will be the default environment called \"root\" which will be Python 2 for anaconda 2, python 3 for anaconda 3. The rest will be identical. Then in a Python 3 env, you will be able to `pip install ipython` without issue and get ipython 6. But what I say won't make sens before you learn to use envs. "

You can activate it in the terminal to use Python 2, or deactivate it to go back to the Anaconda 'root environment'.\r\n\r\nFor more info, see the conda docs @Carreau linked to above."
