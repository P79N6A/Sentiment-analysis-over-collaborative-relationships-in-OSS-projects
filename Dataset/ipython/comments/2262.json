    "body": "Regarding takluyver's comments:  That looks like a good idea, but is a little beyond what I can get into right now.  Someone who is doing regular development could do it, though.\n\nHere is a related experiment:  A similar approach could add a web server handler that serves mathjax directly from the zip file, reducing the >100 MB copy of mathjax to the ~16 MB of the zipped download.  zip files are random access (unlike tar.gz) so it might even perform well.  I'm not sure if it is worth the work to save only 100 MB of installed code size, though.\n"
