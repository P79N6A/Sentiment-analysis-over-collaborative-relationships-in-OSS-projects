In the notebook,that purpose is served by the shading of the input area so continuation prompts only add visual clutter.\n\nA few other points:\n- We make a lot of UI design choices based on the format of the prompts.  I don't see people needing to do prompt customization in the notebook enough that it warrants messing with all of that.\n- Can you describe the css mods that you made.  They might make sense even if the other changes don't go through.\n- What does insert_cell_at_bottom do?\n"
