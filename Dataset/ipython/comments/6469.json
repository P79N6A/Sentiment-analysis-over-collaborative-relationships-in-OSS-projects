    "body": "I'm running into this too.\nLooks like the msg received from backbone.js has already set value_name to an integer in the case where one of the toggleButtonsWidget's values is a string representation of a integer. So somewhere between the widget's on_trait_changed to the _handle_msg_receive on the kernel side the name gets converted/autocast into an integer.\nThe widget's value_names look right. They start out as strings.\n\nThat was as far I could trace it given my half-hour learning how to use the ipdb debugger.\n"
