But there is just so much hours in days, and I only working on IPython as volunteer. So I'll get to it when I have time. Getting this release will also take some time. I'll see if I can work on that this week-end. \r\n\r\nBTW, we have a bot to do backport if necessary, so usually you can either just as a commiter to mention the bot, or we can whitelist people to be able to mention the bot.
