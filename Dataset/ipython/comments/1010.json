    "body": "@paykroyd; just to second what Thomas said, we'd _love_ to have some help with the emacs support. It's been languishing for a long time in a semi-broken state, which is a shame.  For example, it used to correctly follow the debug source file hints, so that if you did %debug inside emacs it would nicely track your files in another buffer as you moved in the stack.  At some point that functionality broke too. It's probably a small fix, but none of us has the expertise to do it and we're too swamped with the core code to have the bandwidth for this.  So it would be fantastic if you could pitch in on this front.\n"
