    "body": "From my point of view, there are several issues here.\n1. the escaped brackets\n2. the escaped $s\n3. the problem that the new commands are local to the particular equation in LaTeX but not in MathJax (here these are treated as global)\n4. it is typically desired to put these declarations into the preamble, which is currently only possible via a custom template.\n\nSo basically it is tricky to get the same behavior in IPython and LaTeX.\n- The first and second point appear because pandoc doesn't allow for the $s to be on their own line. Just put them into the same line as the LaTeX stuff works fine for me (compare [pandoc online](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/try/?text=%24%5Crenewcommand%7B%5Cd%7D%7B%5Cmathrm%7Bd%7D%7D%0A%5Crenewcommand%7B%5Cv%7D%5B1%5D%7B%5Cboldsymbol%7B%231%7D%7D+%25+Vector%0A%5Crenewcommand%7B%5Cm%7D%5B1%5D%7B%5Cmathsf%7B%231%7D%7D+%25+Matrix%0A%5CDeclareMathOperator%7B%5CVar%7D%7BVar%7D%0A%5CDeclareMathOperator%7B%5CCov%7D%7BCov%7D%0A%5CDeclareMathOperator%7B%5Cargmin%7D%7Bargmin%7D%24&from=markdown&to=latex)) (This has been addressed in some issue before)\n- The third and fourth point are - to my knowledge - not that easy to overcome. A custom template, however should work to include the necessary declarations in the LaTeX preamble and \"empty\" equations with just the declaration should include these into the notebook without creating extra garbage in the final pdf. Note however, that you have to use the renewcommand as in the final LaTeX document both declarations appear (in a global and local scope).\n"
