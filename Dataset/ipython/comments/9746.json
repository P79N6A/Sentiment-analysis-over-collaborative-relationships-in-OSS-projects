Since I've barely had any close contact with IPython (basically I dug through its code when I had the above issue) I tend to take Thomas words very seriously and doubt  that my naive fix is legit.  \r\n\r\nIf it helps since IPython 5.0 was released I've been constantly installing ipdb in my virtualenvs using `pip install ipdb ipython==4.2.1` which would force the installation of the previous version. I think I've been lucky not needing any of the new features introduced by 5.0 series.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, you're right about reproducing it with IPython's `%debug%` magic command."
