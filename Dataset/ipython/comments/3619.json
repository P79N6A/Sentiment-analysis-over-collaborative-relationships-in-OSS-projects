    "body": "@ccordoba12 Thank you! I'm glad you could use the earlier PR to create your demo. I hope everything turned out well for you!\n\nThe new API and web service design here is well worth the update. We spent a lot of time thinking about the best way to restructure the APIs, and I think we got it right this time.\n\nI think sending requests to the handlers and checking their responses is the best way to test. We want to create notebooks and delete them, create directories, navigate into directories, rename notebooks, start and restart kernels, etc. All these actions are direct responses from the handlers.\n\nI'll be working on tests myself for the next couple weeks, so there is no pressure on your end. If you happen to write a test while using this branch, I'd love to use it. Otherwise, just feedback on how everything is working for you would be great as well. It's a big PR, so it helps me tremendously to have another person testing it out. \n"

    "body": "Hi @Carreau , there's a method in the notebook manager of this PR called 'get_os_path' which returns the full path where it is launched and any relative path you've added. Is this what your are thinking?\n\nAlso, currently in this PR, you can type at the command line:\n `ipython notebook foo/bar/notebook.ipynb`\n and it will open directly to that notebook. In this case, `foo/bar/` is just a relative path appended to the location where the server lives. \n\nYou could also enter this at the command line:\n `ipython notebook --notebook-dir=(server location) /relative/path/to/notebook.ipynb` \nand it will launch the server in 'notebook-dir` and open the named notebook. \n"

Our focus will mainly be on the web service _design_, not the kind of issues you are seeing... so your review is VERY helpful (any very much appreciated).\n\nMy newer commits from our design review will probably break this branch for a day or two until I fix everything. I just thought I'd warn you, in case you update your local branch and try to run tests. \n"
