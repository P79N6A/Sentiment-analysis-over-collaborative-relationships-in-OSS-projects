    "body": "OK, that will be the problem - IPython stores history in an sqlite database, and sqlite has problems with locking files on the network. We haven't found any good way to automatically detect whether a folder is on a network drive or not.\n\nTo work around it: look for the file `ipython_config.py` in the location given by `ipython locate profile`. If it doesn't exist, run `ipython profile create` to make it. Within that file, search for `c.HistoryManager.hist_file`, and set it to something on the local filesystem (it can be in '/tmp' if you're not interested in your command history. If nothing on the local system is writeable, set it to `':memory:'` to use an in-memory database.\n"

    "body": "We store the history of commands you type into IPython in a SQLite database in the folder @takluyver mentioned earlier.  To prevent two processes from accidentally writing to the SQLite database file at the same time, the file is locked --- meaning only one process can edit the file at a time.\n\nNormally this file locking is handled by the operating system in a robust way.  However there are some known issues with SQLite on NFS drives.  This might be what you are experiencing.\n\nYou can read more about this error: [SQLite: Database Is Locked](http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=DatabaseIsLocked).\n\nThe `export IPYTHONDIR=/tmp` works by placing a new history database (`history.sqlite`) in the `/tmp` directory which is presumably local and for which file locking works properly.  You might also try to delete the SQLite history database in your home directory, or move it away and _copy_ it back (as the previous link mentions), in an attempt to manually \"unlock\" the stuck file.\n"

    "body": "Hi all @bfroehle I am running into this problem too. I sometimes have to spawn hundreds of jobs on a cluster all running the same code (on different datasets). Part of this code does the following:     \n\n```\nipshell = InteractiveShellEmbed(config=cfg, banner1=banner_msg, exit_msg=exit_msg)\n```\n\n(but it does **not** start the shell)\n\nWIth so many jobs running in parallel many of them attempt to access a SQLite that is locked at the same time (this is all on a network drive), which seems to cause the Python script running the code above to exit abruptly. \n\nIs there a way to have IPython wait until the SQlite database is unlocked rather than abruptly exiting if is locked? I guess that as you all said, this is handled by the OS and there is no way to circumvent this, correct?\n\nAs for the `export IPYTHONDIR = /tmp` trick, what would happen if multiple Python processes attempt to access SQlite simultaneously on the same machine? Would the OS handle this situation properly?\n"
