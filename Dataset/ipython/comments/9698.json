    "body": "We've been generally moving towards some of these more obscure features of IPython, meant to \"save every last keystroke\" being off by default.  Currently our `%quickref` info says:\n\n```\nAutocall:\n\nf 1,2            : f(1,2)  # Off by default, enable with %autocall magic.\n/f 1,2           : f(1,2) (forced autoparen)\n,f 1 2           : f(\"1\",\"2\")\n;f 1 2           : f(\"1 2\")\n```\n\nIf we make `%autocall` toggle together not just the first but also (3) and (4) above, I'd say we should then also remove (2) altogether ('/f 1,2), and activate auto-rewrite for all uses of autocall.\n\nThis would leave most of the functionality in place for old hands who may be used to it (I'm sure they are out there), while simplifying the whole thing with a single control and behavior.\n\nI think that's a reasonable improvement, but I also think it's pretty low priority: this is a rarely encountered issue, and I'd weigh working on it against the complexity of the job, which might be high.\n"
