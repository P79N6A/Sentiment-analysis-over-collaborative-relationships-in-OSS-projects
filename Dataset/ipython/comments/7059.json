Also even if many Widget share a traitlets, you will get into edge cases like 'color of the slider' in one description, while in fact it is a dropdown or I don't know what.\n\nSo beyond the empty line (that I don't think are disturbing) can we merge that ?\n\n@silviav12 would you like to try removing the blank line and push a new commit ? Otherwise we can take care of it from here. Thanks a lot for your contribution! \n"
