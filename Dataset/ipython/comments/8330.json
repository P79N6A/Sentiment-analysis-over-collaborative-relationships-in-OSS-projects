    "body": "The default `__dir__()` method does return class attributes (including attributes of parent classes) as well as instance attributes, which makes me think that it should be up to code implementing `__dir__()` to show those if they want to - i.e. most implementations should do something like `return super().__dir__() + [...]`.\n\nOn the other hand, we presumably add the class attributes explicitly because at some point something didn't provide those from `__dir__()`. I don't know if that was an obsolete version of Python or some library, or if it would still be an issue if we changed it now.\n"

Off the top of my head, I can't think of anything other than completions that uses `dir(obj)`.\n\nIf we don't want to recommend that, though, then I think we should support a separate hook that objects can override to provide an informative list of attributes e.g. `_completions_dir_`.
