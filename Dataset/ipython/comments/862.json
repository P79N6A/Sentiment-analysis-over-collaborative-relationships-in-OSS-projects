    "body": "Note: I can't reproduce the two problems you describe in my limited testing with PyQt.  Perhaps the first is a function of window size/position on the desktop or size of the completion list itself.  As for the second, I have no idea why I don't see the problem.\n\nHaving said that, I also don't see any problems with the code itself, and the explicit focus reset can't hurt even for those users who weren't seeing the problem.  So I'm merging now, many thanks for the contribution!\n"

The second occurs when you have other widgets along with the console (only then would a loss of focus become painfully obvious).  I guess I should have created a simple standalone app to demonstrate this.  Thanks for merging regardless though, much appreciated!\n"
