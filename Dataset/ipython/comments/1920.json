    "body": "Actually, I think even #3 might be of interest to have in IPython, if it's not coupled to the spyder code too badly.  But we'd certainly be happy to review and integrate some refactored code that provides a richer widget and also makes things easier for sypder.\n\nAs for 0.13, that's going to be very tight: we are really trying to stabilize the code that exists _now_ in order to have a good release, rather than taking in much new complexity.  So I suspect we'd tell you to leave this for 0.14.\n\nBut obviously that conversation would depend on the actual PR. So your best course of action now would be to actually submit a PR with the changes you guys need.  If it turns out to be both very useful for spyder and simple enough for us to review and trust it won't cause problems, it might go in.\n\nBut we'll definitely want to bring any such discussion on to the full list, at this point we've made a shortlist of only 6 PRs that were 'nearly there' for merge, anything else (other than small bugfixes we've seen today) should first be discussed on the list before tagging it for 0.13 inclusion.\n"

So we're not asking for integration of our improved widget with qtconsole (maybe for 0.14 :-), just the addition of the tiny variable I mentioned in my first post that would make our life a little bit easier. I'll send a pull request with the change so you guys can review it.\n\nAbout #3: It's not too tied to Spyder but it has some rough edges I still have to solve. It could replace pinfo completely on the notebook and qtconsole but that would put a hard dep on Sphinx for you (which I thought you were against to). In our use case we've found Sphinx is quite fast, if maybe that's what worries you.\n"
