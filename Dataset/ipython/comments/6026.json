    "body": "Given the definition of a session, it seems like killing the kernel should imply deleting the session (option 1). This would suggest either:\n- KernelManager maybe has a callback for kernel deletion, which the SessionManager can use to be notified.\n- Any request of the SessionManager API for a session whose kernel has been deleted should finish the session deletion and respond to the request as if the session had been deleted (404, etc.).\n\nOptions 2 is perhaps clearest and communicates what has happened, but there aren't any actions you can take based on that information that differ from an indication that the session itself has been deleted (remember, many browsers have one Session, and they all have the right to delete it). You can't put the Session into a sensible state, you still have to delete the session and start a new one, just like if the Session had been deleted.\n"
