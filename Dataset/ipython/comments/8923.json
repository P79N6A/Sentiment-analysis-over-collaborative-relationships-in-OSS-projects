    "body": "wrt the second issue (autocompletion to an invalid windows path): I think I know how to fix it, but that basically comes down to specifying what the quoting rules are for magics that take paths as arguments.  For example, paths with special characters could be just always quoted, although even then it is not clear whether to favor single quotes (the Unix tradition) or double quotes (the Windows approach).\n\nAs it is right now, it's also a bit awkward to cd to a path that contains a single quote...\n"
