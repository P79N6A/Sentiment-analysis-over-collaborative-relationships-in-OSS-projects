So access is a bit inconsistent in the code and should probably be made similar.  Here's a snippet from the section I'm referring to:\n\n```\n        if self.directive is None:\n            source = 'Unavailable'\n            content = 'Unavailable'\n        else:\n            source = self.directive.state.document.current_source\n            content = self.directive.content\n            # Add tabs and join into a single string.\n            content = '\\n'.join([TAB + line for line in content])\n```\n"

    "body": "So `ipython_rgxout` (and `ipython_rgxin` for that matter) is configurable in the latest IPython.  See: https://github.com/y-p/ipython/blob/PR_ipython_directive/IPython/sphinxext/ipython_directive.py#L858 and also the docstring at the top of the module.  But, the continuation prompt _is_ hardcoded at L199 and L384, so perhaps this whole discussion is moot.\n\nTo the question of whether or not its a _real_ use case, my guess is that most projects will not use it.  But if changing the prompt were so uncommon, then why does IPython allow it in the first place?  Support for customized prompts was put in only to be consistent with this feature of IPython.\n\nPractically, maybe the thing to do is just leave your fix as is and wait for people with customized prompts to complain.  My guess is that the fix would cause problems only for customized prompts that do not have a space after the colon (if there is even a colon).  Would a comment in the code making this clear be sufficient?  That is, something stating that the spacing test is designed to work with the default output prompt and might cause problems with customized prompts.\n"
