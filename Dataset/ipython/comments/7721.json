In some circumstances, people may prefer a wider, scrollable area. I think this depends whether you're deliberately plotting something large, as @erccarls is, or whether you've accidentally created an image larger than the pixel width of the notebook, as was the case in #7701. The latter is very easy to do, since the notebook isn't a fixed width, and I think in that case it's far nicer UI to resize the image than to cut it off and show a scrollbar.\n"
