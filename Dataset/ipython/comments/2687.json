With this enhancement, we will support all the main capabilities that reveal provide us.\n\nThanks, and sorry to bother you all these last days ;-) !\n\n**More info about Speaker Notes:**\n\n**Speaker Notes**\nreveal.js comes with a speaker notes plugin which can be used to present per-slide notes in a separate browser window. The notes window also gives you a preview of the next upcoming slide so it may be helpful even if you haven't written any notes. Append ?notes to presentation URL or press the 's' key on your keyboard to open the notes window.\n\nBy default notes are written using standard HTML, see below, but you can add a data-markdown attribute to the <aside> to write them using Markdown.\n\n```\n<section>\n    <h2>Some Slide</h2>\n\n    <aside class=\"notes\">\n        Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).\n    </aside>\n</section>\n```\n\n**Server Side Speaker Nodes**\nIn some cases it can be desirable to run notes on a separate device from the one you're presenting on. The Node.js-based notes plugin lets you do this using the same note definitions as its client side counterpart. Include the requried scripts by adding the following dependencies:\n\n{ src: '/socket.io/socket.io.js', async: true },\n{ src: 'plugin/notes-server/client.js', async: true }\nThen:\n\nInstall Node.js\nRun npm install\nRun node plugin/notes-server\n"

We can have it in in the cloud, but maybe \nwe have to provide a way to install it locally, as mathjax... (btw, you \nremind me that reveal converter is using mathjax trough cdn... so it \nwill fail to render equation if there is no connectivity). What do you \nthink? Maybe, I am pondering the connectivity to much, but in some \nplaces this can be an important issue.\n"

I think this has to do with the units of measurement.  The input prompt width is in pixels and the left margin of the cell toolbar is in px.\n- The font used in the celltoolbar slideshow select box is too big - it should match that of the other select boxes.\n"
