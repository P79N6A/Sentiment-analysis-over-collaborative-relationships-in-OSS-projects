    "body": "#1865 was closed due to inactiviy. The PR was blocked due to problems supporting SVG. I believe #4250 should fix the SVG problems. \n\n@jonathan-taylor: I would like rebase your PR (#1865) on current master and add support for isolated SVG (using #4250). Is that ok? Do you prefer to do it yourself? \n"
