    "body": "It was me who reported this on the mailing list.\n\nThe problem: When `KernelManager.kernel_cmd` is set in the configuration (let's say in `ipython_config.py` to be concrete), the command-line option `--debug` no longer has an effect on the kernel process, even if `kernel_cmd` is set to exactly the same value that it defaults to.\n\nFollowing the suggestion by @Carreau, I set `IPKernelApp.log_level='DEBUG'` in the configuration, which works fine. So the bug seems to be in passing on the `--debug` flag to `IPKernel`.\n"

    "body": "The notebook forwards command-line args to the kernel by default. Setting kernel_cmd overrides this behavior, and assumes that you are setting the _entire_ kernel_cmd. This is because when you set kernel_cmd, IPython doesn't know whether that's the IPython kernel, IHaskell, or something else, and it can't assume that all kernels support all the command-line flags that IPython does (this includes `--debug`).\n\nThe message logging is done by the Kernel, triggered by adding `--debug` to `kernel_cmd`, so you will have to reimplement it in IHaskell anyway.\n\nI'm not sure there is any bug here.\n"

    "body": "Ah! I did not realize that `--debug` was to the _kernel_ not to the _server_. What I thought it did was log all _received_ messages _from_ the kernel - is there a way to do that?\n\nAlso, how can we make it so that arguments are passed to the kernel, slash is that possible? I tried to find a way to do that and if you use `kernel_cmd` it looks like that's impossible (if I remember correctly what either @minrk or @Carreau  said...) It seems very strange to have a default behaviour which is actually _impossible_ to replicate if you use your own kernel.\n\nBut it looks like this isn't a bug, so it should probably be closed, although there may be some feature requests here...\n"
