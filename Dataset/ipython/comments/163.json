Are we not using those anymore? You left them in some files that you edited, but removed from a couple. Should I just ignore that?\n\nHistoryManager doesn't declare attributes above **init**.py per coding standards, are we soft about that as well?\n\ninteractiveshell.py:\nshould we add underscores in method names (savehist, reloadhist) per PEP8, or leave them as they are?\nIt's a bit funky that they look like this:\n    def savehist(self):\n        \"\"\"Save input history to a file (via readline library).\"\"\"\n        self.history_manager.save_hist()\n\nI imagine that if we rename them, we would alias the oldnames, at least for a while.\n\notherwise it looks very good, great work!

    "body": "My replies to Min's review:\n- coding markers: sorry that it was a bit inconsistent, I wasn't paying too much attention.  A while ago we added coding markers systematically because we had a few files with unicode characters explicitly in them.  But we actually have very, very few of those: I've removed over time most instances of my last name being accented (PÃ©rez).  I guess I find the coding marks unnecessary noise most of the time, and without thinking much I nuked a few.\n\nBut I'm happy to revert that or agree on a different long-term policy.  My preference would be to use the marks only when actually necessary (which would be pretty much only when doing testing that explicitly does unicode tests).\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n- History manager: yes, I totally dropped the ball here.  The object should declare its interface before **init**, as we agreed.  Sorry.\n- +1 to changing savehist to save_hist (and other similar ones).  We inherited a lot of those run-in names from old code, we should update now.  Obviously we do need to keep the backwards compatible names around for a while.\n\nThanks for the review!!\n"

Notes (I'm quoting by copy/paste from you):\n\nhistory.py\n\n```\n* Let's have ShadownHist take shell as the argument and get rid of its usage of ipapi.\n```\n\n[done, good catch]\n\n```\n* HistoryManager still depends on readline, can we eliminate this dependency if readline is not available?\n```\n\n[I think we could, but it would take a fair bit of testing, and we'd have to manually implement ourselves those functions.  Nothing hard, but it's not a small fix.  For now we'll just keep on living with that, I'm afraid.  There's only so much I can clean up one pass :) ]\n\n```\n* store_inputs makes me happy!\n```\n\n[ yes!  I think overall we're in much better shape with this (even with the unicode problems, which I'll work on).  The architecture is _right_.\n\ninteractiveshell.py\n\n```\n* Let's make self.buffer and self.buffer_raw traitlets of type List, so they are type checked and have the defaults ([]) set by traitlets. This will also help us clear out init_instance_attrs.\n```\n\n[ Actually those variables are slated for complete removal.  Once we fully trust this system, we'll get rid of runlines, push_line and these buffers.  I added a note, but won't bother changing the code since they'll just go away later.]\n\n```\n* Same for self.execution_count.\n```\n\n[ Done, good catch]\n    \\* FIXME at the top of run_cell is outdated? Let's update the commits in this method, because it is pretty important and subtle.\n[ Yup.  That fixme was pretty much the blueprint for what I did :)  I had just forgotten to remove it]\n    \\* Should we remove runlines?\n[ Eventually, most certainly.  I think we're pretty close to being able to get rid of it, just not quite there yet.  A bit more testing and shaking out of the new code, and we'll nuke it]\n\nThanks again!
