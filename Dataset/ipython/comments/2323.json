    "body": "I loaded https://github.com/ipython/ipython/tree/0.13.1 in my browser.  On that page, I found a URL, so I used \"git clone https://github.com/ipython/ipython.git\" and then ran \"setup.py install\" in the ipython directory that resulted.\n\nSince you could not reproduce the  problem, I created numpy.py containing only \"raise ImportError\"; with this, ipython works as expected.  So, I removed it and started over.\n\nIn my system, \"import numpy\" fails with ImportError when it can't find the fortran library, but only after importing > 70 packages that are nested within numpy.  IPython ignores this error, but that results in a second attempt to import numpy, which fails in a different way - it finds an AttributeError deep within numpy rather than ImportError.  The AttributeError escapes the try/except , so I can see it.  This is an improvement, but it is an accident of the numpy implementation.\n\nAt this point, I think this is a built-in deficiency in the de-facto usage of python.  The convention is:  To detect if a package is present, try to import it; ImportError means it is not present.  As we have seen, that is not a reliable way to detect the presence of a package.\n\nI'm not sure what to suggest for IPython.  The command \"ipython notebook\" failed in a way that hid the fact that the problem is with numpy, but I don't see an obviously clear and correct solution.   Maybe imp.find_module() is a better way to test if a package is present,  but I have not fully investigated the implications.\n\nAt the moment, I think my solution is to provide a \"test everything\" function to all my users.  When they report a problem with something (ipython in this example), I can have them run \"test everything\" to see if anything else is broken at the same time.  (Of course, in this case the user only told me that ipython did not work, not that several other things also did not work.)\n\nb.t.w.  If you want to reproduce the problem in your system, I think all you need to do is remove numpy/linalg/lapack_lite.so from the installed numpy.\n"
