It's pretty trivial to switch on a key in the message, so I don't think there is any real difficulty extending multiple channels on a single connection.  That said, I wouldn't do this if SockJS didn't require it, so if we stick to requiring pure websockets, a 1:1 channel system is cleaner.\n\nThe clear advantage of this: it works behind proxies, etc. in the _many_ environments where websockets don't.  It's simply a matter of whether we want to wait for systems to support websockets or not, and how long we expect that to take.  Making the move to sockjs is extremely easy, so we can do it at any later point if we want to give up on waiting, etc.  \n\nI didn't set out to make a PR, but just reading about how it might work resulted in fully working code, so I thought it might be worth it.\n"

I got the link by going to min's profile https://github.com/minrk/ipython go to `branches`, then `sockjs`  then zip link in the headers. \n\nIf you want to do it with git, add a remote \n\n```\ngit remote add minrk https://github.com/minrk/ipython.git\n```\n\nfetch it\n\n```\ngit fetch minrk\n```\n\nnow you can try to merge `minrk/sockjs`\n\n```\ngit merge minrk/sockjs\n```\n\nBut please be sure to understand what you do, or ask for clarification. \n\nYou could also get a look at https://gist.github.com/3342247\nwhich allow you to simply refer to pull request by their number. which would be \n\n```\ngit merge origin/pr/2321\n```\n\ndon't hesitate to ask if you need help, and also https://help.github.com/ is a good place to start learning git.\n"
