    "body": "Actually I wonder if we can't revisit the GUI for completions completely...\n\nI don't like a drop list _at all_ as a selection mechanism; drop lists are inherently one-dimensional and are better suited for rapid navigation with a scroll wheel than the keyboard.  But tab completion is a keyboard-initiated action, so we should be optimizing the UI for the keyboard.\n\nI would much rather prefer that we present the available completions in a 2-d popup text area that shows all available completions (as long as they fit), and that allows 2d cursor movement for selection.  If the area isn't large enough to show all completions, then it should support page up/down to bring a new set of completions (as well as single-line arrow key scrolling), with a visual cue at the top/bottom indicating where there's more.\n\nWhat do you think?  @Carreau, do you think you want to take a stab at it?\n"
