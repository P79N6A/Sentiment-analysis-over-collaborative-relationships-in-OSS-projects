    "body": "It seems a bit odd to me to backport something that's totally unused by IPython to a stable release already in bugfix mode, only to provide a minor convenience. We aren't super strict about bugfixes-only, though, so maybe this is appropriate for 3.x.\n\nThe downside to backporting new code is typically support - bugfixes, etc. need to be backported as well. It also means freezing an API that will be new in 4.0 that hasn't been released yet. If we do merge this, that means that this API in master needs to enter backward compatibility mode before its first release, and avoid backward-incompatible API changes, and you should make sure to backport any fixes found in 4.0 to 3.x. Can you commit to being responsible for both of those?\n"
