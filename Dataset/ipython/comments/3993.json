There are still the kinks (e.g., consistent printing to pdf), that make the IPython + Reveal.js promise always anxiety-inducing. I've encountered this a few times, and have had to scramble to see it deliver. \n\nOnce it and Live Reveal mature, this will be a godsend to many who use ipython. Thank you all for the hard work and I am really looking forward to contributing more. :smile: \n"
