    "body": "Hi @ppmfloss, thanks for the feedback! I've tried with the version from the master branch (`7.4.0-dev`), and tested on several different Python versions. The results are:\r\n- Python 3.5.3: works fine.\r\n- Python 3.6.0: works fine.\r\n- Python 3.6.2: works fine.\r\n- Python 3.6.3: the issue still exists.\r\n- Python 3.6.4: the issue still exists.\r\n- Python 3.7.0: works fine.\r\n\r\nSo it appears this only affects certain versions of Python. I did a search and my wild guess is that it could be related to Python bugs, for instance <https://github.com/python/typing/issues/506>. Not sure if you would plan to add workarounds to target Python versions, but I guess the better solution for me is to upgrade my Python installation."
