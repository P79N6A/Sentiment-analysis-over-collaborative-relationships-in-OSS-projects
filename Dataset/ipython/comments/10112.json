    "body": "@xoviat I'm not sure how your comment relates to the current issue, but the pypiwin32 project is simply rebuilds of the pywin32 project, which is hosted on Sourceforge and does not provide wheels. Pywin32 provides wininst installers for 3.6, which can be converted to wheels using ```wheel convert``` or Christoph Gohlke hosts wheels on his site.\r\n\r\nThe pypiwin32 project was set up by glyph to offer a source for pywin32 wheels which were usable from pip. His original builds were rebuilds, and I added some extra builds generated via ```wheel convert```.\r\n\r\nI don't see much advantage in a Github organisation - requests against pywin32 should be directed to their project infrastructure at sourceforge. I do *not* want to try to offer support for pypiwin32 independently of pywin32 (I can't speak for the other maintainers on this, though). What I might do is try to find some time to ```wheel convert``` the pywin32 220 builds from sourceforge and add them to the pypiwin32 project, though. No promises, though - IIRC glyph had some concerns about simple conversion, so I'll need to check with him as to whether he'd be OK with that."
