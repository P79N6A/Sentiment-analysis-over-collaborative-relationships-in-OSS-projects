Just want to clarify the behavior:\n- Clients can submit tasks before engines connect.\n- Those tasks are pulled into the scheduler immediately and put into the DB.\n- When engines connect, they are scheduled.\n- If a queue_status is given before engines connect, useful information is returned.\n\nThese behaviors looks good.\n"
