    "body": "In general I think you should avoid copy pasting figures directly from the notebook into presentations. Independent of the parameter settings discussed here, IPython also lowers the DPI of figures in notebook output. This helps keep the size of the notebook down, but it can also degrade text and other smaller figure elements. I think you might find that you get crisper output if you save the figures using matplotlib and then import the resulting files into your presentations.\n"

One great thing about the notebook is that one doesn't have to come up with figure names and output directories anymore. Plus, others who only have access to the html version, can select figures to extract and add to presentations. \n"
