As per @takluyver I will add a link from the Sphinx docs to that new location.\n\nAs far as the sphinx directive not rendering properly, I definitely have not updated all of the content to render perfectly on GH.  There is still a lot of content that needs work.  That is going to have to be a larger project for the community to tackle together.  I mainly wanted to 1) get the content over to GH and 2) organize it into a structure that will make future editing/organization sane.\n"
