    "body": "These look fine to merge, but I'd suggest you split it into two separate commits.  Since one entails changes to an external dependency, I think it's best to always have those available in nice, isolated commits.  It makes it easier to send the patch upstream, reapply it if we update to a new version from upstream that doesn't have the changes, etc.\n\nSo my vote is: rebase by splitting into two commits, one for each file, then merge away.\n\nThanks!\n"

    "body": "OK, I've split them, but I found another minor bug. The kernel in Python 2 has a `sys.stdin.encoding` of None, so @minrk's `getdefaultencoding()` function fell back to using the locale. In Python 3, `sys.stdin.encoding` is 'ascii', although the system is using UTF-8.\n\nOn the principle that most systems now can handle a superset of ascii (either utf-8 or a Windows code page), I've made `getdefaultencoding()` try the locale encoding if `sys.stdin.encoding` is None or ascii. I think the only way this could make anything worse is if a subprocess is returning ascii output on a system where the locale encoding is not ascii compatible (e.g. UTF-16).\n"

If the terminal is ASCII, the default locale should presumably indicate ascii as well.\n2. If the terminal is ASCII and the default locale indicates another encoding, it will most likely be either UTF-8 or an ascii compatible code page. So any characters we get from the terminal should be correctly decoded anyway. The only situation in which it could is if the locale incorrectly indicates a non-ascii-compatible encoding, such as UTF-16.\n"
