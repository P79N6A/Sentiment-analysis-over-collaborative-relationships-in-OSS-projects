    "body": "The underlying problem here is that to get responsive GUI windows and a responsive repl you have to integrate two event loops (the GUI event loop so it responds to mouse/keyboard events) and the terminal event loop (which echos when you type and executes when you hit enter).\n\nIt was only working without the magic in earlier version of IPython because PyQt installs it's own input hook which is picked up by the core python readline implementation of the repl.  It is a that this worked with PyQt (if I recall correctly tk also install's its own (as it is the _reason_ that the input hook exists) as does gtk, but pyside and wx do not).  \n\nWith IPython moving over to prompt toolkit it does not use the readline repl and hence does not make use of `PyOS_InputHook` (which is a void pointer in the right place for readline to find it).\n\nThe 'official' position of mpl has always been that to get reliable interactive non-blocking plotting in the repl is to use the IPython magics.\n"

    "body": "Thanks @tacaswell, that clarifies things.\n\nYes, our position is also that you need to use the `%matplotlib` magic to integrate the event loops. That certain backends previously worked without that was a happy coincidence, but with the new terminal interface, you'll need to use the magic.\n\nIf it were to be automatic, I think that would make most sense to do that in matplotlib - when it was about to create an interactive plot window, it could check 'am I in IPython?' and ensure that the relevant event loop integration is selected if so. This could also fit in with our goal of making `%matplotlib inline` or `%matplotlib notebook` the default when IPython is running as a kernel.\n"

I know that %run is used to run scripts non-interactively but, is there any way to return to the previous behavior?\n"
