In general, we just have the policy of having a copyright notice at the top of files that says\n\n```\n#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#  Copyright (C) 2001-200X OLD Copyrights Always Left intact\n#  Copyright (C) 200Y-200Z OLD Copyrights Always Left intact\n#  Copyright (C) 2008-This Year  The IPython Development Team\n#\n#  Distributed under the terms of the BSD License.
