    "body": "This is a perfectly reasonable and expected behavior. You seem to misunderstand\nthe difference between displaying an object and having an object beeing the output of a cell. \n\nImage create an Image object that, if last statement, trigger the **display** hook that shows it. \nAs you yourself point out, to print a string you use print. You expect : \n\n``` python\n's1'\n's2'\n's3'\n```\n\nIn a cell to only show s3 right ?\n\nSame goes for Image/HTML/Javascript/... or any object that have a representation. You need to explicitly 'display' them.\n\nSo here you might want to do \n\n``` python\nfrom IPython.display import display\nmy_image = Image(...)\n...\ndisplay(my_image)\n```\n\nSo display is the equivalent of \"print\" but for rich object.\n\nOr in short\n\n```\ndisplay(Image(...))\n```\n\nYou will see that the difference between a \"returned\" object that trigger display hook and the `display()` version is that the first get the `Out[..]`prompt. Not the other.\n(and actually you can display the same object many times)\n\n``` python\nfrom IPython.display import display\nmy_image = Image(...)\nfor i in range(10):\n    display(my_image)\n```\n"

    "body": "Thanks for clearing that up. You're right, I was conflating the effect of creating the object with displaying it. Your example with the strings makes clear the difference.\n\nThe docstring for Image was part of the problem. It reads:\n\n> Create a display an PNG/JPEG image given raw data.\n> \n> When this object is returned by an expression or passed to the display function, it will result in the image being displayed in the frontend.\n\nPerhaps better as:\n\n> Create a PNG/JPEG image object given raw data.\n> \n> When this object is returned by a cell or passed to the display function, it will result in the image being displayed in the frontend.\n"
