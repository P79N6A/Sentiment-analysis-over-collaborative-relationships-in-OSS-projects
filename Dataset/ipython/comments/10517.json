    "body": "Hi, thanks !\r\n\r\nUnfortunately you can't \"just\" remove `object_inspect_mime`, it's part of the public api, so other can require it. So it would need to be deprecated first. \r\n\r\nSecond we are more likely to move toward using `object_inspect_mime`  as it return more information than to remove it.\r\n\r\nIf you look closely it's more `object_inspect` and `object_inspect_text` that are similar. Not identical, but similar. You'll see that `inspector._get_info` does a bit more than `inspector._info`."
