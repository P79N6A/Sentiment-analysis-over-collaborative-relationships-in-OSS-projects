    "body": "For the record, there are a couple of pathological cases which could still fail. Exceptions inheriting from BaseException directly won't be caught - that's kind of the design of the system, to allow `KeyboardInterrupt` and `SystemExit` to keep propagating when you'd catch any other exception. And on Python 2, old style classes from outside the exception hierarchy can still be raised. However, all of the exceptions Python itself uses are in the hierarchy, so that's only possible if something is called than does an explicit `raise`.\n\nI don't think we need to worry about either of those cases, I just wanted to mention it in case anyone disagrees.\n"
