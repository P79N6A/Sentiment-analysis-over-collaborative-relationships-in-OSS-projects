Since we _know_ that we cannot use bower for everything, I don't see a good reason to add our own repos for the ones that bower can't handle.  That would mean we are maintaining our own repo as a submodule to track an installed clone of our own repo that is itself not even our own code, just for a stupid tag.\n"
