    "body": "Thanks, Min!  I edited the commit so it would auto close the bug and rebased to avoid the merge \"handle\" since it was a single commit.  Pushed.\n\nThere may be a cleaner fix for this later on, I suspect we should spend some time disentangling that code better (the old stuff had very tightly coupled debugger/traceback/interactive calls).  But for now this closes an important regression, so let's go with this fix.  Thanks!\n"
