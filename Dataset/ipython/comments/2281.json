    "body": "Two cents: Black/White contrast is not the only kind of contrast found in the colour spectrum. Text that has the same b/w balance can be perfectly readable if you use opposite colours wisely. Notice how [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) is readable while avoiding overuse of b/w contrast.\n\nAnother way of dealing with this issue would be just to make it easier for the user to customise the colour scheme, rather than just revamping the default ones. As it is, to change the colour scheme I don't just have to change the definitions at IPython.utils.coloransi, but I have to make sure IPython.core.prompts, IPython.core.excolors, IPython.utils.PyColorize and  IPython.core.oinspect all use the colours I defined and where I want them to. A central file with all the colours definitions would simplify that a lot. (Please note that I'm working on IPython-0.13)\n"
