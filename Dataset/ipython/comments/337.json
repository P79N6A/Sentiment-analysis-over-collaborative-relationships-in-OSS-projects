    "body": "Two issues there. At a guess, the tooltip is popping up because the information request is being handled without the modification to the builtins that we make for execution (see IPython/core/builtin_trap.py).\n\nAs for calling either: we override exit and quit with magic commands, so you can just type `exit`. It would be good to do something more helpful if you try to call a magic command (`exit()`) though.\n"

    "body": "Yep, I figured that last part out. I guess in general it would be good to detect collisions between builtins and magics that shadow them if you try to call them, but giving the user false information via incorrect call tips is probably of more immediate concern. :)\n\nI'm not sure of the right place to it though. I think I've got a pretty good idea of what's going on (client passes object_info message and replies with the result of object_inspect from InteractiveShell), but there doesn't seem to be a \"right\" place to deal with this magic corner case.\n\nIt seems that what needs to happen is either that first message has to carry back some information with it (specifically whether the shell instance is in automagic mode and has a magic attribute that shadows a builtin with that name, etc.), or there needs to be a more messages exchanged. I am sufficiently ignorant of the design philosophy you guys have taken to know exactly what the right approach is, though.\n"

I _think_ we just need ensure that object_info requests are handled inside the builtin_trap context manager; that way it won't find the builtin exit or quit functions. But the kernel-client model isn't something I've worked on a lot.\n"
