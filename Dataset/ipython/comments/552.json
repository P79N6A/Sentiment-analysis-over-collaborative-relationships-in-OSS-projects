    "body": "Thanks for doing this, Min. Apart from those couple of things (the point about uuid4 is the only one that I'm confident needs to be changed), that all looks sensible. It passes the test suite on Python 2 on my machine. I get 8 errors when it's ported to Python 3, which is substantially better than before.\n\nWe should also update the what's new section of the docs, where I'd said that the parallel machinery wasn't working in Python 3 for the 0.11 release. We probably want to say that there are some known issues, but users can start trying it out.\n"
