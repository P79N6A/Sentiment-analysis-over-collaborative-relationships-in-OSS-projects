    "body": "> Is it supposed to be a feature?\n\nYes, it is a feature.  Every cell starts with all figures having been closed.  You can disable that as described above with `c.InlineBackend.close_figures = False`, in which case the cells don't matter.  You can also use matplotlib's OO interface to keep using objects across cells:\n\n``` python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nx = np.arange(1, 5)\nax = plt.subplot(1,1,1)\nax.plot(x, 2*x, x, 1.5*x)\n```\n\nand in next cell, you can add a grid to the figure, but you will have to explicitly ask it to be drawn again.\n\n``` python\nax.grid(True)\ndisplay(ax.get_figure())\n```\n"
