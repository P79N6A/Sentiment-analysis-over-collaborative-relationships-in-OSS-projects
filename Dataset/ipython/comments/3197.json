I can't figure out a way to get multiple plain text text dollar signs as it is, so the best I have come up with after a bit of fiddling is `$\\$\\$\\$\\$$`, which will give you dollar signs in the mathjax font.\n"

For example, the following:\n\n> Several starting pitchers have signed or been extended this offseason, and those who would be expected to provide similar value to Jimenez commanded contracts of $\\$$10-13M per year for contracts ranging from one year (Colon) to four (Garza). A 2-year contract in the range of $\\$$12-14M annually would be on the higher end of market value, yet cap the total risk to the team below $\\$$30M. Moreover, the length of the contract might incentivize the player to play for another contract in the near future.\n\ngets rendered as:\n\n![dollar signs](http://d.pr/i/9SWh+)\n\nIn other words, works fine for the first dollar sign, or multiple in the same MathJax expression, but gets confused at multiple separate ones.\n"
