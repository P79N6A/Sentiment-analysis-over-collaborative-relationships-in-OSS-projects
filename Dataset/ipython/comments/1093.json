    "body": "Hi Fernando, \n\nI was diving into this because it seems to be accessible to be my first contribution to the ipython core.\n\nLooking what you mention I found the `extract_hist_ranges` function. \n\nhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/f62c4ca09914872755677bd84a26705522fe6bf3/IPython/core/history.py#L759\n\nbut isn't it heavily oriented to the history lookup?  For example, which would be the meaning of `%load -r ~5/8-~2/3`?\n\nMay be it's a better idea to refactor this function or made a new one without \"session\" , right?\n\n```\n(?P<start>\\d+)?\n((?P<sep>[\\-:])\n (?P<end>\\d+))?\n```\n"
