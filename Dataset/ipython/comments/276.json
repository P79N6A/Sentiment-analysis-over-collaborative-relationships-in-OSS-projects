    "body": "Unfortunately, there is not a good alternative. IPython is now using the v2 string API for both PySide and Python 3 compatibility reasons. This means that any Qt code using IPython must also use the v2 API.\n\nTo avoid having to order your imports in a silly way, you should make a call to sip.setapi before any Qt imports in the main script of your application. (You do not, of course, need to put a setapi call anywhere else.)\n"
