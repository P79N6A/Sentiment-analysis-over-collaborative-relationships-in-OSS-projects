    "body": "Min;\nThanks for the confirmation that this wasn't expected behavior. I dug into it more on my side and realized it was a result of my logging setup (which also uses ZeroMQ through logbook). The connections there weren't being cleaned up as tasks finished, leading to the open connections. Apologies about the noise and thanks for all the work on IPython parallel, I'm really enjoying using it.\n"
