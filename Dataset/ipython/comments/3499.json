It might be a nice test\ncase for a standalone (third party) converter (hosted as a separate project\non github under the ipython org).  It could also possibly be in the ipython\nrepo.

    "body": "My current thoughts about this issue:\n- I can understand the refusal to include reveal.js in IPython because it wouldn't be a dependency for the live notebook. I hope to learn enough js to do a live version of the reveal converter, but probably it will not be soon...\n- I also think that we need to provided (by default) a static slideshow converter inside IPython, and reveal can do this job. The idea that Brian has proposed with the Writer seems interesting and a perfect use case...\n  I am also trying to get a CDN from jsdelivr with all the necessary reveal.js files. Here is the current PR: https://github.com/jimaek/jsdelivr/pull/46\n- I am thinking about an independent reveal slideshow extension... but for a more complex converter with new features to give the users the possibility to change more design patterns. I talked about this idea in my talk and in the sprint (with Brian, Fernando and Tomas) when I explained a closed PR: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/3432\n\nSo, to summarize...\n- I would like to make sure that the _basic_ (the current one) reveal slideshow converter work with a CDN (o maybe through a Writer) but **inside** IPython. A static slideshow capability, I think, is an enough useful tool to exist by _default_ (the use of this converter by a lot of people in the SciPy2013 conference - at least 8 talks - show us the need for a capability such as a slideshow - reveal - converter).\n- I will develop an improved version for all the users who wants to go deeper in the design of their slideshows.\n  (probably I will need to do some changes inside IPython.nbconvert, but this changes will be _hidden_ and will not bother to the basic users).\n\nThoughts?\n\nDamián.\n"
