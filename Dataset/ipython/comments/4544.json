    "body": "I have deliberately not changed the instructions on how to get pyreadline. Personally, I do \"pip install pyreadline\" in a virtualenv as the binary installer is no use to me (it only installs into the system Python). I don't know enough about distributions like anaconda and enthought to be able to comment.\n\nThe key point for me is to be clear that pyreadline is not actually mandatory. As it has a bug that means I can't install it in certain situations, I found the docs saying that it was mandatory to be confusing, so I'm looking to make the actual trade-off in not having it a little clearer, that's all.\n"
