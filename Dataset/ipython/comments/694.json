    "body": "I'm pretty sure the crashes are caused by instabilities in PySide, because with PyQt I've _never_ had a crash in over one year of intensive use. Unfortunately pyside is very new and it seems it's not really ready for prime time quite yet. It would be good if you can report this also as an EPD bug, they might be able to find the root cause of the problem and work with the pyside project to fix it.\n\nHaving said that, it would indeed be useful to have the calltips be configurable, so I'm keeping this open.  Thanks for your report!\n"
