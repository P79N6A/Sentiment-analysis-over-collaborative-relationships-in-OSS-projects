    "body": "Well, it makes the test pass, but is it in fact a bug that IPython gives the EOF error message at all? As Jens points out, a plain Python shell (2.6 or 2.7) gives the SyntaxError message.\n\nI think this is because, before Python 2.7, code to be compiled in exec mode had to end in a newline. So I think when we compile to the AST, we need to ensure there's a newline at the end.\n"
