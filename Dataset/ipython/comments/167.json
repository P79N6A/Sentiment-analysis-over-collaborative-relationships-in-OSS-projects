But this looks great, and I promise to get back to it and test it.\n\nOne minor note: you may want to make a feature branch for this, in case it grows and your master picks up other things, so the html-print-specific work stays contained and we can review it in isolation.  I think you can edit the source branch for the pull request after the fact.  If not don't worry for this one, just keep it in mind for future proposals.\n"
