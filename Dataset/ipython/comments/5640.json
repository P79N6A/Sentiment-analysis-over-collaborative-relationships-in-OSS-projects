    "body": "Hmm, ok, so _not_ stripping whitespace from the arguments of line magics causes problems, e.g.:\n\n```\n%load_ext  autoreload  \n```\n\nwill try to load the extension \"  autoreload  \", which does not exist.\n\nOne solution would be to fix cell magics so they parse their arguments in the same way as line magics, and treat all non-escaped and non-quoted whitespace as irrelevant. Alternately, make line magics be responsible for stripping whitespace. I don't know if the former would break anything important. The latter certainly would.\n"
