Config is a persistent thing in almost every application - it's our current system of transient config that's weird.\n\nI would think it would be too much of a change. things like `IPcompleter` or `InlineBackend` are changed on a notebook to notebook basis, and brutally changing the behavior of `%config` could screw up many environment.\nI think there should at least be 1 IPython version with a smooth transition. like a `--persist`/`--no-persist` with 1 of them being the default.\n\nOr a completely different magic that **does** explicitly persist, but do **not** change the trait value live, and/or do not try to do fancy stuff like executing in `user_ns` to get values.\n"
