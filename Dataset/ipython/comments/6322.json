We try to fight it and the browser won. \n\nMoreover there are always case where this does not work. \nYou run 10 cell and while it is executing you start scrolling or editting a new cell. Your scroll description is wrong, as you don't see what you are typing...\n\nSo you are welcome to try, but we spend quit some time on it and decided that we shouldn't try to fight the browser model, so be prepared for some rough edges.\n"

I would myself be frustrated if I started executing 10 cells at once, and then I am trying to type on some other cell, and my browser keeps on scrolling upwards .. arggh .. \n\nAre there any other ideas on making the UI and transitions, more smoother(buttery, cheesy? :D )?\n"
