If it was possible to split on comma though, it would just be nice to pass list like that.\nI'm not expert on config system, but when the trait is set, there is probably a way to detect that the Type of the trait is list and split on comma no ? \nIf you think there is some edge cases, maybe a child of List that split itself on some value if what is passed to it is a string ...\n"
