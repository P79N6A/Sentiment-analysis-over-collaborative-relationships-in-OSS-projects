    "body": "As you discovered the IPython kernel runs independently of the IPython console, and details such as terminal encodings aren't passed from the IPython console to the kernel.  One big issue here is that multiple consoles (each with different preferred encodings) can connect to the same kernel.  If I remember correctly, UTF-8 was chosen because of it's commonality and ability to represent the entire unicode spectrum.\n\nPerhaps we should make an IPython configurable for the kernel stdout encoding?\n\nAre there any other ideas for how to tackle this problem?\n"

    "body": "How about supporting multiple `_repr_*` at sympy side?  This is what sympy extension already does, right?  This solution fits well with multiple console architecture of IPython.  I think there are several ways to implement this: (1) add `__repr_pprint_unicode_` and restrict `__repr_pprint_` to use only ascii characters; (2) define `_repr_pprint_` using ascii and also define `_repr_json_` to send equation as AST; then sympy can register extension to convert `_repr_json_` to unicode at client side, if the client support unicode output.\n\nAdditionally, I think terminal client should convert unicode into the encoding supported by the terminal (with 'replace' or something).\n"

How can IPython client construct meaningful equation from a unicode string when it can't use unicode?\n\nBut I agree that client should do something when unicode is sent via stdout/err, to avoid encoding error.
