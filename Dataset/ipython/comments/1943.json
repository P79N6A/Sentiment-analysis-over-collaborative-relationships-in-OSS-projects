    "body": "The paragraph about the tooltip is a subheading under the heading about changes to the notebook UI - it's not so obvious in the source, but it's clearer in the output. And when the other notebook changes are described, it should be obvious.\n\nThe tab-completer screenshot looks great. For the notebook, I think we'll want to pick a couple of good screenshots as an overview of the changes. @ellisonbg probably has some thoughts on that.\n\nGood point about the website. It needn't be updated yet, but I'll prepare a pull request so that we can easily update it when we make the release.\n"
