There was PR https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/3312 about hooks – closed as not \"the direction we want to go\" – and minimal discussion in issue https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/977.  I cannot find any further discussion about adding hooks: Is progress towards hooks being discussed somewhere?\n\nThe problem I have with relying on `clean` and `smudge` filters is that this means a separate solution is required for each version control system. In particular, I could not find a good way of doing this in mercurial.  To minimize maintenance, it would be best if the cleaning process could be kept VC agnostic.\n\nThe second issue (outstanding in all methods as far as I can see) is: how does one incorporate pulled \"clean\" changes into one's working notebook?  Probably something along the lines of first merging the two \"clean\" versions, then inserting the new content into the working notebook (removing any outdated output).  Any suggestions?  (Some way of updating one notebook from another seems to be required for this.  I am not sure if that is the jurisdiction of `nbconvert` or something else.)\n"

These are great in the short term, and their only disadvantage is kludging together a configuration that works, and like the original poster noted, remembering to clear all output before saving is something I'm bound to screw up if I don't script it. Is there any plan to bundle these scripts (or similar functionality in a command line script) as part of IPython?\n\nI also noticed that there was some discussion of adding configuration options so that users could disable saving output. Last time I accessed http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/config/options/notebook.html, I didn't see any options that would save only input cells. Is there still a plan to implement this feature?\n"
