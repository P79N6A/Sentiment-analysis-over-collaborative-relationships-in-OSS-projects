    "body": "Looking at the ZMQ code (https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/blob/master/zmq/core/context.pyx), line 72 is the definition of the `Context.instance()` classmethod, which has a default integer argument. Could RubyPython somehow be mishandling this, perhaps by filling in `None` as the argument, overriding the default? As far as I can see, the `Client.__init__()` code is all correct.\n"

This reveals that the second time the interpreter is started, the classmethod is not properly a classmethod, and the class itself is being passed as the argument, instead of iothreads.\n\nI don't know if this is the fault of RubyPython or Cython, but one of the two is definitely doing something wrong, because the Context class is certainly not being constructed correctly at the second invocation of the interpreter.\n\nIn the meantime, you can get prevent this call to Context.instance() if you create a Context yourself, and pass it to the Client constructor.\n"
