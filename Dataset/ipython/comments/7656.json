    "body": "> Looking some more at that code and how it's used, I don't think it's clearly separated enough from the Qt console to be worth releasing as a separate package. \n\nTrue right now, but TBH `QtAnsiCodeProcessor` looks weird design-wise. It inherits from `AnsiCodeProcessor`, but their concerns are different; i e one parses raw terminal data into (still ANSI) attribute sets, and the other translates ansi attributes into qt attributes, which looks more like functional composition.\n\n> If you make it a separate library ping us we might start to depend on it ! \n\nI will probably just copy the relevant parts to `nvim-ipy` for now, but later on I might publish library and send PR to refactor in the new QtClient repo :) \n\nI looked quickly into pyte but it looked wrong level of abstraction, it keeps an entire virtual screen state, instead of just the formatting state machine.\n"
