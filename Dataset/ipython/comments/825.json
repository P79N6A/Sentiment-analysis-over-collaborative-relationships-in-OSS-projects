You could try the `try/except` solution suggested above by @cboos; if it works for you go ahead and submit a PR for this.  As long as it doesn't cause any problems with newer pygtks, we'll be happy to include the fix.\n\nI'm retargetting for 0.13, b/c we're basically at the point of releasing 0.12 and I only want to focus on critical issues that absolutely must go in before release, this doesn't quite meet that threshold.\n"
