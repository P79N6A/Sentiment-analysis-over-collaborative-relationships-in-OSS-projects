From my personal experience with JS I think we should use JSDoc3 as @Carreau has suggested.\n\nI believe it would also be wise to stick to the commenting conventions that JSDoc3 enforces, because it seems to be the standard across all other JS doc generators, and a convention in the JS community itself. If we were to do otherwise it would probably make it difficult for people who like working on JS stuff to get involved, or we would have to write our own doc generator.\n\nAlso, dev docs seems to be a pretty flexible thing, and requires one to write a scraper in order to rip documentation from the original project and collect it into the Dev Doc fold. We would first need HTML documentation in order to write the scraper. I'm still trying to figure out the details on how to write one though.\n\nI'd be happy to make this a pet project of mine! Just let me know!\n"

    "body": "I am -1 on using JSDoc3\n\nGvR has made fantastic choices over the years to build things into Python\nthat make developers happy. Triple quoted docstring are one example. They\nmake it easy to provide inline API documentation for classes and functions\nwith almost no formatting junk or visual distraction. They are meant to be\nread by people who are working with the code.\n\nThings like JSDoc3 come out of the Java world and are designed, in my\nhumble opinion, to make developers angry and frustrated. Why do I say this?\n- The API docs are above the function/class signature, rather than below.\n- Complex multiline comment formatting is required. You can't \"just write\"\n- They are designed for machines to parse and render into something pretty.\n  They are not designed for developers to read inline.\n\nOur primary usage case for API docs is developers looking at the actual\ncode, not dev-users reading about our APIs on an HTML web page. I don't\nknow what the right answer is for generating API docs, but I don't think\nthat JSDoc3 is it. One very attractive solution is to simply not provide\ngenerated APIs docs for our JavaScript. They are completely unstable so I\nam not sure that generating API docs is helpful. I would rather hand write\nnarrative API docs for the few parts of our APIs that are approaching\nstability.\n\nOn Mon, Apr 14, 2014 at 7:25 PM, Freyert notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Hey there!
