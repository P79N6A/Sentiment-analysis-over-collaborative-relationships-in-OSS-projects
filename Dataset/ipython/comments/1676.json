    "body": "This looks pretty good.  My only behavioral complaint is what happens when you shutdown a kernel.  Frontends are not notified by anything other than regular heart failure.  But then again, I think this is exactly what happens if you kill a kernel from one frontend, while it is in use by another, so perhaps coordinating clean shutdown is a separate issue.\n"
