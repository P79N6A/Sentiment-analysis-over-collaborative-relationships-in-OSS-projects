    "body": "Yeah, I wasn't trying to say that the exception shouldn't be silenced or anything. It just makes debugging hard.\n\nIt _might_ be possible to catch the errors explicitly in this case, but I can't remember right now. The main reason for catching everything (i think) is that `eval` can throw pretty much anything, since you don't have much control over what's going in.\n\nBut probably good practice, in the future, is to try to minimize the amount of code being silenced. So if that big of code on line 736 had been written instead as\n\n```\ntry:  # completer.py line 736\n    evaled_result = eval(callableMatch, self.namespace)\nexcept:\n    continue\nnamedArgs = self._default_arguments(evaled_result)\n```\n\nthen i suspect this bug would have been found earlier.\n\nbut whatever. this is pretty minor.\n"
