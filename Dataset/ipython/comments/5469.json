    "body": "The `cwd_for_path` alone wouldn't work in my case as I have a `MetaManager` that manages `NotebookManagers`. Each root folder corresponds to a different backend which would have separate logic for the kernel cwd. \n![home](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/610115/2562415/5ccd5f02-b84a-11e3-9224-c96bede8e48b.png)\n\nI get the attempt at separating the KernelManager and NotebookManager, but they are still coupled. The KernelManager needs to the know the `notebook_dir` of the `FileNotebookManager` in order to match the proper cwd. If the KernelManager did not provide the proper `FileNotebookManager`-_specific_ working directory, we would rightly consider it a bug. The kernel_path is tightly bound to the `FileNotebookManager`, it only gets to masquerade as separate concern because the current `MappingKernelManager` and co are setup to support the `FileNotebookManager`. \n\nBTW, in this PR, the `KernelManager` is still oblivious to the `NotebookManager`. It's just the app doesn't pretend that the kernel path isn't a concern of the `NotebookManager`. \n"
