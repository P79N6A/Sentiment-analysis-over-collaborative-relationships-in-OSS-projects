    "body": "There are definitely some bugs in the string/unicode/bytes logic in nbformat.  In the JSON roundtrip, the problem is that the inverse of the b64 encode is never called.  This doesn't come up, because the bytes are already b64-encoded in actual practice, and the bytes-logic in the JSONEncoder is actually never called in Python2 (as far as I can tell).\n\nI think the real bug is that the base64_encode/decode functions in rwbase encode cell.png / cell.jpeg, but as far as I can tell, those attributes never exist.  png/jpegs are attached to _outputs_ of a cell, not the cells themselves.\n\nThis doesn't come up in Python2, because that output appears to always already be b64-encoded bytes, which pass right through to/from JSON without issue.\n"
