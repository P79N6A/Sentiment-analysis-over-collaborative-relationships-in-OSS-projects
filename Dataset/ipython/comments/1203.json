    "body": "Mmh, this one unfortunately needs a rebase before we can merge it.  I'm OK with pushing the pyreadline version dependency, since it's an easy install for users, EPD ships it anyway (so EPD users don't have to worry about it separately) and if it helps us simplify other parts of the code, that's always a good thing.  1.7.1 was released in Oct 2011, so by the time 0.13 comes out, it shouldn't be too much of a problem to require it.\n\n@nathan-rice, if you can rebase this we can go ahead. @minrk, should we also do the cleanups you have in mind here or do you want to handle that elsewhere?\n"
