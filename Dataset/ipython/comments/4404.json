    "body": "IPython version: 1.1.0\n\nOS: OSX\nBrowser: Chrome or Safari, but NOT Firefox. I have all three open looking at the same notebook, and Chrome and Safari both have the same behavior on the same cell, but Firefox acts normally. Refreshing doesn't change anything.\n\nInterestingly, the example I'm looking at does not have any weird behavior in Emacs. So perhaps the Emacs thing is totally separate. If it comes up again I'll make it a separate issue with EIN. Last time, however, those \"Read only\" segments of text had this unclickability behavior in Chrome.\n\nAccidentally not clicking in the right spot is definitely possible in general, but this particular issue is very repeatable and holds up to examination. Did you mean something besides simple misclicking?\n"
