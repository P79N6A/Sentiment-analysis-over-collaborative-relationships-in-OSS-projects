It may depend on where we decide to put the kernel logo. Floated over there on the right, I don't think it looks weird for the space to be empty. If we put it on the left in between Jupyter and the document title, for instance, it should probably always have something.\n\nIt might become confusing once we have (in real time collaboration) current users avatar in a place like that. Though, technically you are collaboration on  a document with a kernel...\n\n> I would also probably just use the IP[y]: part of the ipython logo (leave\n> out the full word IPython below). Otherwise it looks really small...\n\nAgreed.\n"

I think it will be easier to style all of this once we start using the shorter description \"Python 2\" - more representative of the actual space the kernel descriptions will occupy.\n\nThoughts? Merge now and style later? Or do all that here?\n"
