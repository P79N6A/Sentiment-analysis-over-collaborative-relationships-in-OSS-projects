Maintaining lexers for every language out there is a pretty herculean task. I don't know if there's some way we can help him out with that."

I've been trying to work on a pygments theme that matches jupyter notebook for syntax highlighting python, but there are lots of limitations in the python lexer that I'm encountering. Particularly the lack of information regarding operators. I really need an ```Operator.Assignment``` token for things like ```=, +=, /=â€¦``` since the notebook doesn't highlight these operators as it does for others."
