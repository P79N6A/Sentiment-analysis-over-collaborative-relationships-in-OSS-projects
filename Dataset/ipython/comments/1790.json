Could you try to make the patch as a codemirror extension for commenting ?\nYou should find a demo [here](http://codemirror.net/demo/formatting.html). \nYou can also try to have your changes incorporated upstream.\n\nAlso, usually, we prefere to have different fix in different PR, it allows us to merge one fix even if we don't agree (yet) on the implementation of another one.\n\npinging @ellisonbg as he should be consulted for the notebook.\n"

    "body": "I agree that when some lines are commented and others are not and the user attempts to comment/uncomment the section, you should look at what is done on the first line.  If it is uncommented, comment the block and vice-versa.\n\nI also notice that the selection logic is wonky.  When I use Shift and arrow keys to select a block of text and then comment that block, The line after the block is also affected.  I think the selection logic is pulling the trailing `\\n` and it should be discarded before commenting.\n"
