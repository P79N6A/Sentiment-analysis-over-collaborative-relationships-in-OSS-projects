    "body": "Perhaps, when there is single completion option, besides auto-populating command line, IPython should actually select this one and only available choice in completion dropdown box. This would be consistent with current completion workflow, as command line gets completed only if user selects option from completion dropdown menu. \nThat way pressing Enter afterwards, will dismiss completion box, and allow user to execute.\n"

I think this is actually rather confusing...\n"
