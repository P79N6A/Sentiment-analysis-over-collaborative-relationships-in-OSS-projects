This problem was now solved by running \"sudo ifup lo\".\n\nPerhaps a more verbose error message to suggest this solution to the user would be more helpful than simply \"Cannot assign requested address\". i.e., \"Make sure that local (lo; 127.0.0.1) interface is running. try \"sudo ifup lo\", or something like that.\"  Thanks!\n\nAndy\n"
