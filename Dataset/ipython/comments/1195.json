In the meantime, you can see here a quick example on how to do a simple latex export:\n\nhttps://github.com/ellisonbg/sympy-qcpaper/blob/master/notebooks/exportlatex.py\n\nWe'll put in tools for this kind of manipulations, but for now it should be trivial to whip up something like this yourself in a few lines, tailored to sympy.\n"
