    "body": "# testing scope\n\nI only had time to try a subset of the new functionality - merging code cells, editing code cells in ACE. I didn't have time to try the markdown and html cells.\n\n# usability nits\n- my first guess for \"edit in ace\" was under the edit menu... \n- when i went to try merging for the first time, i first tried to multi-select cells. took me a few tries to find the right menu item. \n- I looked at ace as well, and I found it a bit buggy in their kitchen sink demo. What is the benefit of using ACE vs. just styling up Codemirror? You can get line numbers, error/break markers, and anything else in CodeMirror as well.\n- when I switched to edit a cell in ACE, I thought something had gone wrong, like i had lost my other cells. once you are editing in ACE, it is a little scary to click a close button without saving first. maybe you could just plop the ACE editor right into the same div as the original codemirror cell?\n- was there always a BUSY signal in the top right? I love it. \n- refreshing page after working on a new notebook for a while actually creates a new notebook. /new should probably redirect to the new notebook so that /new and opening an existing notebook have the same url context. also good for getting the permalink to the actual notebook\n\n# functional bugs\n\nmenu header selection bug:\n- click on menu header (e.g. file), header is selected, menu displayed\n- click on same menu hader again, menu disappears but header is still selected\n- clear by selecting an item in the same menu, or picking another menu (e.g. file --> save)\n- quick screen capture: http://screencast.com/t/A9v1OptTki\n\nblank file name accepted for notebook:\n- click notebook title, delete all text\n- save notebook with blank name\n- go to notebook list, your original notebook is gone\n\nfirst time load of a notebook after upgrading from 0.12, requires a refresh for the javascript \n\n# design ideas\n- maybe when a cell is selected, you could add a little tab to the div with extra controls to move it up/down, ACE edit it, merge it\n- multi-selecting with ctrl-mouseclick, or shift+arrow keys like you do in excel would be cool. maybe this would work well with the tool tab idea above. or maybe there's a hotkey to merge the cells that are selected\n"

Related to all of the CodeMirror issues I am having.\n\n@Carreau: yes, we will need to add the unminified source.\n\n@fawce:\n- We should better understand why Ace is better or not.  CodeMirror has improved a lot so I am not sure it makes sense to have a Ace mode.  Also, we could make the editor a dialog which would show the original notebook cells in the background.\n- Maybe name the \"Close\" button \"Return to Notebook\" or something?\n- Only one Ace editor is allowed on the page, which makes it difficult to inject into the cells.\n- We should have multiple select.\n- The bugs in the Menu are on the jQueryUI side of things.  We are using beta quality code and I expect it to improve over time.\n"
