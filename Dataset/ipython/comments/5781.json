    "body": "I fixed a variety of issues in the dict key completion, especially when greedy=True in #5790. One of the effects of that PR is removing auto-close of quotes and brackets when they were opened outside the text passed to the dict key completer (i.e. greedy=False), which I think were not appropriate to do, given the current hierarchy of completion.\n\nCompletion should get a major refactor in the future, which would allow us to be more sensible about that sort of thing, but I don't think it makes sense with how it works today.\n"
