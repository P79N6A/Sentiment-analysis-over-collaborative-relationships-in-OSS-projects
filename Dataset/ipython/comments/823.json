That commit defers loading of the plugins to much later, and by that point we're at the mercy of pkg_resources finding things by its own mechanisms.\n\nIt means there's no way to have our own plugin be the one that goes in, because pkg_resources looks for things on its own, and somehow finds mpl's.\n\nJust tracing this has been a nightmare, and I'm out of time.  I'm going to have to revert that commit; I'll try to at least protect against the `NOSE_WITH_DOCTEST` env variable, but users simply can't have a noserc file that uses `with-doctest=1` if they want to run our test suite, at least for now.  It's a bummer, but the nose flow is so complicated that I got lost.\n\nAnd I'd rather keep this limitation (we've had it for ages) than have a broken test suite in the next ubuntu out of the box.\n"

    "body": "OK, this is actually an ubuntu bug in how they are packaging matplotlib.  I've filed the report here:\n\nhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/matplotlib/+bug/871176\n\nand I'm discussing with mpl how to go about it in mpl itself.  But in the meantime Thomas,  a solution is to manually edit the file `/usr/share/pyshared/matplotlib-1.0.1.egg-info/entry_points.txt` and comment out the whole thing (it's just two lines).  That takes care of the problem.\n\nI won't revert Matthew's commit then, as this is best handled by fixing the ubuntu package.\n\nWe can close this when they fix it in ubuntu, but I'm leaving it open as a reminder for us...\n"
