It looks like I ran into a problem with it back in 2011 after a Sphinx update, and my few changes were to fix that problem.  It also looks like its only real function is to tweak the design of the LaTeX output, and thereby the pdf output.  I gather from a commit comment by @fperez that pdf is no longer routinely produced; everyone uses html in practice.\n"
