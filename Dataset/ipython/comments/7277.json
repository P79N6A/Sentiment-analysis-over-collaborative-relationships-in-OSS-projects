    "body": "No this isn't a bug. In order to work with interact, a custom widget must have a traited `value` attribute that has a simple scalar type. That is by design. What you probably want is to use the `fixed` function in the `widgets` module:\n\n```\ninteract(myfunc, df=fixed(mydata), ...)\n```\n\nFixed will pass the df to the function as a raw DataFrame each time and you can do what ever you want. \n\nBut honestly, interact is probably not the right thing to use for complex composite data such as a `DataFrame`.\n"
