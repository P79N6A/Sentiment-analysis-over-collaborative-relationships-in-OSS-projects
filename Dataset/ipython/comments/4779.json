    "body": "Hi Andrew. I think the issue is that the notebook server uses `sys.executable` to start the kernel in a matching version of Python. In a frozen state, `sys.executable` is your frozen exe, so starting the kernel tries to launch the notebook again.\n\nI think you can get round this by freezing a separate exe for the kernel, and then starting the notebook with `notebook.exe --KernelManager.kernel_cmd=['kernel.exe', '-f', '{connection_file}']`. But I don't think we're going to officially support this - since IPython is for writing and running Python code, there's little reason to run it without a real Python environment.\n"

    "body": "That was the exact problem cause of the problem. \nI fixed it a different way however, updating my bootstrap python file to detect when it was being launched in kernel mode and start appropriately. This way there's only one exe to build.\n\nIn the same way I've got it set up to run nbconvert as well.\n\nIt's working great except for not being able to find extensions properly (such as storemagic)\nIf I build in folder mode (not single exe) and copy the extensions folder into the dist folder (with the spec file) it works fine, but not when the extensions are bundled into the exe in single_exe mode. \nI'm sure I could find where they're loaded and modify it to support finding the extension files when frozen, but it's not causing me any problems currently so will put it off.\n\nFor anyone else, here's my bootstrapping file and .spec files to build a standalone notebook.exe\nnotebook.py http://pastebin.com/tTt4WEAJ\nnotebook_single_exe.spec http://pastebin.com/xb6z70FK\nnotebook_folder.spec http://pastebin.com/uG0i4Bxf\n\nI also used http://iconverticons.com/online/ to convert the icons file ipynb_icon.icns to ipynb_icon.ico for use with the above spec files\n\nThanks,\nAndrew\n"
