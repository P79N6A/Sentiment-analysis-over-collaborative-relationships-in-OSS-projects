    "body": "I deprecated `unquote_filename` because it was 1) useless (unquoting is already handled by `arg_split`) and 2) broken (it is legal to have unescaped single quotes on Windows).  So it should really not be used anymore; I just forgot to remove the call to it in `get_py_filename`.\n\nOnce I do this, I may as well deprecate the `force_win32` kwarg to `get_py_filename` as well.  So what about\n\n```\n'unquote_filename' is deprecated since IPython 5.0 and should not be used anymore.\n\nThe 'force_win32' kwarg to 'get_py_filename' is deprecated since IPython 5.0 and should not be used anymore.\n```\n\nand remove the tests that use `force_win32`?\n"
