The people in the meeting preferred application/x-ipynb+json (we also considered application/x-jupyter-notebook+json, and both of those without the +json suffix). Looking at the official mime type registry [1], +json and +xml are common suffixes to indicate container formats.\n> \n> Does anyone want to argue for a different mime type before we declare application/x-ipynb+json the victor?\n\nThere was a brief conversation following. The fact that it can't be remembered suggests that maybe you should reconsider :) Not too late for `application/x-jupyter-notebook`\n"
