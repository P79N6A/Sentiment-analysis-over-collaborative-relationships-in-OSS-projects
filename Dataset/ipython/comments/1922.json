You unzip the package and you're offered `setup.py`, `setupegg.py` and `setupbase.py`. What do they do? Do you only need the 'base'? Should you be using these 'eggs' you vaguely remember hearing about?\n\nOn the other hand, I can't imagine anyone opening it up and thinking \"huh, where's the setupegg.py file?\" Most Python projects just have setup.py, and even within the scipy ecosystem I'm sure people are used to using that.\n"

This execfile patch is the first patch to setupegg.py in years, and I expect will be the last one needed until Python 4 at least.\n\nRemoving setupegg.py would require more complicated logic in setup.py for no reason at all, because there are lots of setuptools commands not in distutils, and the list currently in setup.py is quite far from complete.\n"
