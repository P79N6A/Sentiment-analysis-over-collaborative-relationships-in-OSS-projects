If you are adding newlines, you are doing so with the HTML notion that newlines and spaces are semantically indistinguishable (i.e. you are only using newlines for readability).  Since this is not true within markdown, newlines are replaced by space before processing with markdown.\n\nThis also allows us to be safe, in case multiline input somehow gets into a heading cell via an input mechanism other than our own.\n"
