I just prefer something ugly for 1.0 than something plain wrong.\n\n> - why not just use regular single local variables, and only pass around the ones that are actually used?\n\nMain reason, to do it fast. \n\nSecond because a dict will be muted, whereas I'll have to return and assign in the second case, which is painfull in js as you can't do the following if a function return a tuple.\n\n```\na,b = my_fun(x,a,b)\n```\n\nProcess_math could also be a closure.\n"
