    "body": "In Python expressions and statements are not the same thing.  It's the difference between `exec` and `eval`.\nuser_expressions only allows _expressions_, i.e. things passed to `eval`.  That does not include assignment.\n\nIn this way, `get_ipython().system(u'ls')` actually does work, in that it should give None, the result of evaluating that expression.\n\nNow, it can be argued that we should enable more elaborate things via a mechanism like this,\nsuch as capturing output, but that is the basic reason it behaves as it does.  The keyword is 'expression'.\n"
