We have a `cast_unicode_py2` function for when we *know* it's redundant on Python 3, so if we're using `cast_unicode` instead, there's a chance that that is necessary even on Python 3.\r\n\r\nAlso, as with your PR to my fork, can we ask you to do it with your editor configured to not strip whitespace? It can cause merge conflicts and problems with `git blame`."
