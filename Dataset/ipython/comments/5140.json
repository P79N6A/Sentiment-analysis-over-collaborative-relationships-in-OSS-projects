I'll try to play with it tomorrow.\n\nFor reference, this is a way to give users control over what kernels they have running, since we don't have yet (and won't have for 2.0) the dashboard we would like to see that summarizes all active kernels. Without that, right now it's easy to leave kernels running all over the place, and no way to know where they may be (while they potentially consume resources).\n"

    "body": "Output of the %kernels magic is just HTML with JavaScript, so you can actually press the update button without there being an active kernel. Eventually, we've talked about having delayed kernel starting (on first execute, not on notebook load), and again there, if the output is already embedded in the notebook, you will be able to get an updated kernel list. Finally, it gives you an indication of the location of the current notebook (the entire path, not just the name) - information that is otherwise not visible elsewhere.\n"

It forces you to start a kernel to list active kernels ??\n4.  All this is pure html/js why not already put it in the dashboard ?\n\nMy take is just make it another tab in the dashboard, the magic does not make sens to me so I'm strongly -1 (with really high value for 1) in having it a magic. but I'm +1 for having it in the dashboard even if it is refactored in 2 weeks.\n"
