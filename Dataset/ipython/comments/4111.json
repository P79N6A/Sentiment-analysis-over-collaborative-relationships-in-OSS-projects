(I don't want it to be editable as Markdown b64.) This would be much nicer for e.g. sharing notebooks, since I wouldn't have to remember to copy the image file along with the notebook ... having notebook files be self-contained (code+results+docs+_figures_) is a big feature that I don't want to lose.\n"
