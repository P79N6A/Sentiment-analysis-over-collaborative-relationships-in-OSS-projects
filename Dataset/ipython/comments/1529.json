    "body": "I've realized that this feature is potentially a bit dangerous, as modules don't always keep their `__all__` too well.  For example, numpy doesn't list `float` in `__all__`, presumably b/c it's a builtin.  But this means that with this new feature on, users could be mislead into thinking that `numpy.float` isn't a valid dtype identifier, since they would see other similar ones but not `float` itself.\n\nIn any case, since the feature is off by default, it won't bite anyone by accident.  Advanced users can decide to activate it and it will be their responsibility to be aware of what happens.  Furthermore, since it can be easily toggled at runtime with `%config`, I'm not  too worried.\n\nThe implementation looks clean, and with good tests, so I'm merging it (after review and also interactive testing).  Many thanks for the contribution and the persistence of going through 3 PRs :)  And also thanks @takluyver for your diligent work on it!\n"
