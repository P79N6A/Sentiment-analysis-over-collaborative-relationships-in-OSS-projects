Notice how that issue is tagged 'Difficulty: Insane' and 'Priority: None'. I have little interest in opening that can of worms.\n\nThat issue discussion also describes the creation of [winpty](https://github.com/rprichard/winpty), which is, I think, the kind of thing we'd need to get it working. But... \"Winpty requires two g++ toolchains.\" That's not the kind of thing I want to end up debugging.\n\nWe've asked some people at Microsoft about the possibility of having a pty-like interface as part of Windows. But I'm not holding my breath.\n"
