    "body": "No problem, we had kind-of a schema in 2.0, but the format and our code was not designed with the schema so we were not enforcing validation. \n\nNote that invalid notebook that load should work on 3.0 and can be save. You case is just really special in that `list.pop` can take only 1 arg in python, while dict can take 2. \n\nSo you are bitten by the combinaison of upgrading, being bad format, and the specific case of your metadata being a list, so I doubt this is worth fixing that. It would require some hairy heuristic in `IPython/nbformat/v4/rwbase.py` that would work for this specific case but not in others.\n\nI'm going to close, but will be happy to reopen if we see problem like that a lot.\n"
