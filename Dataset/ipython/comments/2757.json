The disadvantage of merging it is we are taking responsibility for a package-management issue.  The advantage is this issue can still come up for IPython installed manually on a debian system with incomplete pyside.\n"

The downside would be a little extra complexity to handle an odd corner case.\n\nI suggest we merge it. The complexity would exist anyway, just as a Debian patch, and I think it's a good idea to minimise the amount of patches we make distributions apply.\n\n@bfroehle , @minrk : any objections? If not, I'll merge this tomorrow.\n"
