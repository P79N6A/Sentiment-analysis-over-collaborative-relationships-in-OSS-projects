    "body": "And of course you are correct in all things you just said. Sorry I totally forgot I Macports had 2.6 installed, as I forgot that 2.7 is the default for Lion. It works fine with \"python2.7 python.py\" , fortunately there symlinks for all python versions available. \n\nOk I want to embed ipython to my project , an add-on I make for blender ( https://github.com/kilon/Ephestos ), and blender uses its own embedded cpython 3.2 , won't the source i fetched from the repo cover me ? I don't expect Ipython to run out of the box inside blender , just that the code is python 3 compatible . Am I correct ? \n\nThanks a ton for your help, I close this issue . \n"

In oder to make ipython to work inside my project that is also inside blender, the only way I can think of is to embed ipython inside my app or at least port it partially to my app. \n\nMy intention was not so much to use ipython as it is but rather to make a hybrid between a REPL (what ipython already is ) and a code editor with visual coding abilities. So in sort I want to mess with the source code and frankenstein it. \n\nHowever before doing that I must first learn to use it properly and see exactly how it work thus the need to install it. Obviously will take me some time to digest all this functionality and source code.  \n"
