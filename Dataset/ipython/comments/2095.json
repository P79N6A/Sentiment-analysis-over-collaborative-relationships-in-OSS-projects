    "body": "Thanks, I've been thinking of aiming for this.\n\nI think `exec` is actually the trickiest bit - the function form won't work under Python 2 if you're specifying the namespaces, as far as I know. The workaround would be to declare our own `exec_` function, like six does: https://bitbucket.org/gutworth/six/src/0c712d55e12c/six.py#cl-297 (In fact, we could use six, since our own py3compat module duplicates quite a bit of its functionality).\n\nFor unicode strings, I think the approach Django took was to use `unicode_literals`, and then use `b'bytes'`, `'unicode'` and `n('native string')`, as there are relatively few cases where the latter is needed. So long as your native strings are all ascii, `n = str` works.\n"
