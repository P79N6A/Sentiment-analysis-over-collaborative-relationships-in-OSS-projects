    "body": "1. I think there's a reason cdn.mathjax.org can't get a valid certfile, otherwise they would already serve https from there.\n2. We can't use `//cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js`, because it doesn't have a valid certificate.\n\nThere are two fairly easy configuration solutions:\n1. You can set the mathjax url configurable in your own custom deployment, it's just:\n   \n   ``` python\n   c.NotebookApp.mathjax_url = 'https://c328740.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js'\n   ```\n2. Or you can ship your own copy of mathjax, and serve it from the same server (many people serve mathjax locally on their own laptop, since it's much faster than using a CDN).\n"
