This allows you to check the return value of the callback for cancelation. Does this ordering make sense? We could trigger the callback _afterwards_. The thing I am worried about is if the action raises, but the callback was fired beforehand. Imagine trying to set a dict value for something that is not-hashable. That will raise, but the callback will have fired. Hmmm...\n- The general way that cancelation and ignoring is described in the docstrings is confusing. I would talk about \"removing/deleting an existing callback\" and \"canceling an action\".\n"
