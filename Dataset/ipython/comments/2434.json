I resurrected it as an extension (26afef67a14a361b7def5b5c4093dc8c4507babd), at which point you had to add the extension to config to get autorestore. Then in #1073 I made the extension load by default, and added the configuration for autorestore. So it's been a long time since autorestore was happening by default.\n"
