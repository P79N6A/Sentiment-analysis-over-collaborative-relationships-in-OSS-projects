    "body": "The reason is that IPython tries to handle code copied and pasted from an interactive prompt, like this:\n\n```\n>>> a = \"\"\"\n... 123\"\"\"\n```\n\nPeople often start selecting after the `>>>` prompt, so if the second line starts with `...`, it assumes that it's copied from an interactive session.\n\nIn IPython 2.x, it matches anything starting with `...`; #6027 made it a bit more specific, so that it matches `...` followed by either a space or the end of the line. That will make the example you gave work correctly in IPython 3.0.\n"
