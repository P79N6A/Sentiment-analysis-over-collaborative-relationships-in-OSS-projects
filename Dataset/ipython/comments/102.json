We still need to investigate whether we can fine-tune %autocall to still work while producing less spurious **getattr** calls.\n"

    "body": "Honestly, I don't think this is fixable while having autocall active.  Autocall needs to inspect the objects fairly aggressively and I don't think we can make it work without triggering getattrs.  The answer is simply: if your objects have so many side effects that you can't call getattr on them more than once, disable autocall altogether.\n\nClosing here.\n"
