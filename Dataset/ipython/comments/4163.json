    "body": "The issue is that the default encoding is supposed to be our best guess for talking to various system things, like running subprocesses. If the system reports `cp0`, then we don't have much information to go on, but as I understand it, utf-8 is quite unlikely to be the right guess anywhere (on Windows). It's possible to set code page 65001 to use UTF-8, but I don't think that's the default anywhere, and not many users do it manually.\n\ncp1252 certainly won't be correct for everyone, but if we have no other information, I think it's our best guess on Windows.\n\ncp1252, utf-8 and ascii (and most other code pages) are equivalent so long as you stay within ASCII characters (bytes 0 to 127). So if you're an English speaker like me, it will probably work no matter what you pick. To test it, you need to throw in some characters like é or ø or €.\n\n@jstenar : You're the Windows & unicode expert - what's the best default to pick if we don't have any information on the  current code page?\n"
