    "body": "Thanks for investigating this so thoroughly, but I don't think this is quite the right fix: if your .py files have been changed more recently than the .pyc files, then there's something odd going on. And having libraries installed in non-user-writable locations is not specific to OSX. I think this is another pointer that autoreload shouldn't rely on examining .pyc files, which is issue #4127.\n"

    "body": "Sorry, take a bugfix and a feature together. Today i read the code, and do some try. I found i was wrong:\n\nThis ImportError bug because on OSX make module.**dict**.clear() ,deleted of these key can make module that contain absolute import reload ImportError\n\nI see [#4127](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/4127), It needs to solve the cache a lot. \n\n`pre_run_code_hook` make every line excute `check()`, \nWhether it is not a call to reload the module, the module will traverse sys.modules, Most of them are unnecessary.\n\nYou can see [this commit)[https://github.com/dongweiming/ipython/commit/8bc38b699c5fe4ffc25d9c2e5099f1c032eb285e], But travis-ci is failure. I do not understand this testâ€˜s principle\n"
