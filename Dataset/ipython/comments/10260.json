    "body": "Thanks for merging! ðŸ˜ƒ \r\n\r\nYou milestoned this as 6.0. Are you sure you don't want this in 5.x? Considering that https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/7b7d560822d4e9b6ab486393e22e305c502ff6d1 is already in 5.x and this pull request essentially completes it, and also fixes the prompt numbers so they look like they used to in IPython 4 and below.\r\n\r\nSince 5 (LTS) is the last version to support Python 2.7, many will be using it for quite a while even after 6.0 is out, maybe even using both versions at the same time since they work with both Python 2 and Python 3. Considering this, it will be nice if IPython 5 on Windows uses the same colors as IPython 6+ on Windows, otherwise it would look quite weird for a user that uses both versions that the colors are different and it's nicer if the user doesn't have to use custom configuration to make them the same (At least as long IPython 5/6 and later use the same highlighting system)."
