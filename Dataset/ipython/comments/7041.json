    "body": "I once again ran into the issue where setting a traitlet causes the default value to be calculated, so this PR now also implements something @minrk and I were discussing last week: if a traitlet is set before using it, the default value is not calculated, and the trait changed notification callbacks are called with `None` as the old value.\n\nI found only two traitlets in our codebase that broke with this change, and I fixed both of them.\n"
