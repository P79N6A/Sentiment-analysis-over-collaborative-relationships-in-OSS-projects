    "body": "Deprecation warnings: I'd like to make at least one release with the new machinery in place before the old ones start warning. Otherwise it's a pain for packages that need to support the old and new versions for some period of time. Nbconvert is one such package, for instance.\r\n\r\nConcerns about extensibility, e.g. priority attributes: I know, it's not great. To be honest, although I hope this is an improvement on the old API, it's still complicated enough that I would advise anyone to avoid extending the syntax unless there's really no other option. Maybe we should define a more restrictive API that's safer to build?\r\n\r\nWould it be worth doing a survey of who currently extends input transformation? There are only a couple of use cases I'm aware of that really need *text* transformation as opposed to AST transformation:\r\n\r\n- Converting float literals to decimals before they are parsed and represented as a binary float. This is transforming already valid Python syntax into something different, which is much easier than what we need to do in transforming code that's not already valid Python.\r\n- There's a [very old extension](https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/ipython-physics) that allows for calculations with uncertainties and units: `m = 80 +/- 5 kg`. IMO, at least the units part would be more idiomatic as multiplication (`80 * kg`) than a special syntax. Though I've got no good answer for the uncertainties part.\r\n\r\nOn reflection, I'd like IPython to get out of being a framework for people to build custom Python-like languages. It's a pretty bad framework for that, and doing it well is a hard problem that we're not really trying to solve. There are much smarter people than me working on parser technology."
