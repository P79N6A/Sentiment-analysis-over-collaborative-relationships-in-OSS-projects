Seeing as this _should_ be the desired default output, I would argue that ipython should use that option when internally calling pandoc.

You seem more concerned by pandoc adding newlines than you are by it removing them. `--no-wrap` prevents pandoc from inserting newlines in long lines, but it does _not_ prevent pandoc from concatenating short lines.\n\nSince `--no-wrap` ensures that every paragraph is a single line, I don't agree that it is clearly the desired behavior (it absolutely isn't for me).\n"
