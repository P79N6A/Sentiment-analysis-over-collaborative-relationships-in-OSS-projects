They are just instantiating the object, and it works, so the deprecation warning is unhelpful and updating the import requires adding frustrating IPython version compatibility code.\n2. It doesn't work, and they need to update how they use TerminalInteractiveShell. They may get a warning that the import changed, but no information about how the object they are trying to use may have changed, so the deprecation warning doesn't improve the experience, it just adds one more thing to change in order to be compatible with the new API.\n\nIn both cases, I see no benefit to the (invisible by default) deprecation warning and moved import. In the first case, the no-deprecation is clearly better, while in the second case it seems no worse. Am I missing something? Right now, it reads like changing things just for the sake of changing things. I'm trying to see whose upgrade experience is improved by changing this import.\n"
