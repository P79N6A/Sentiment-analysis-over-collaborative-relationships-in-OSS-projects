    "body": "Hey @bgschaid ,\n\nI'm glad you opened the issue.  @sylvaincorlay has also experienced a lot of pain because of this change.  A quick fix is to use the 2.x `set_css` method, replacing `self` with `widget`:\n\n``` python\ndef set_css(widget, dict_or_key, value=None, selector=''):\n    \"\"\"Set one or more CSS properties of the widget.\n    This function has two signatures:\n    - set_css(css_dict, selector='')\n    - set_css(key, value, selector='')\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    widget: Widget\n    css_dict : dict\n        CSS key/value pairs to apply\n    key: unicode\n        CSS key\n    value:\n        CSS value\n    selector: unicode (optional, kwarg only)\n        JQuery selector to use to apply the CSS key/value.  If no selector \n        is provided, an empty selector is used.  An empty selector makes the \n        front-end try to apply the css to a default element.  The default\n        element is an attribute unique to each view, which is a DOM element\n        of the view that should be styled with common CSS (see \n        `$el_to_style` in the Javascript code).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not selector in widget._css:\n        widget._css[selector] = {}\n    my_css = widget._css[selector]\n\n    if value is None:\n        css_dict = dict_or_key\n    else:\n        css_dict = {dict_or_key: value}\n\n    for (key, value) in css_dict.items():\n        if not (key in my_css and value == my_css[key]):\n            my_css[key] = value\n    widget.send_state('_css')\n```\n\nAs a long term fix, maybe we can readdress the decision to remove set/get_css, @ellisonbg @jasongrout.\n"

    "body": "Thanks. But it doesn't work for me. `widget._css` is a tuple and therefor assigning to `widget._css[selector]` fails. And I didn't go through the code to see what \"formatting\" the data in the tuple requires.\n\nHaving a `set_css` would be cool (if it isn't a technical problem) but as an immediate fix I'd suggest to modify the migration-guide (it is OK if stuff disappears from the API, but at least it should be correctly documented)  \n"
