    "body": "It shouldn't wait for the sleep to finish, the `-f` flag should be sending the process into the background and returning as soon as a connection is successfully established.  The sleep is there actually as a timeout for initial traffic over the tunnel, to prevent SSH from closing the tunnel prematurely, and also to keep it from being left open indefinitely. It should have no effect on the actual responsiveness of the `openssh_tunnel` function. I suspect there is some SSH config that is causing `-f` to be ignored. Are you using ssh-agent, or any other more advanced ssh config?\n"

    "body": "I'm using ssh-agent, yes. After doing some debugging, it seems that `ssh -f server` fails if I use `ControlMaster auto` and already have a connection open to `server` (as I almost always do). In that case, `ssh -f server sleep 60` reports \"auto-mux: Trying existing master\" and then waits for the command to complete. If this is expected behavior for ControlMaster, then shouldn't `openssh_tunnel` be detecting that and working around it, or at least showing a message to the user?\n"

It has obvious disadvantages, but I can't think of a better way right now. Obviously, the ideal action to take would be to just add the tunnel to the already existing connection, but I can't see a way to do that.  What do you think?\n"
