    "body": "Hi there, \r\n\r\n1) I would suggest getting used to use `jupyter notebook` instead of `ipython notebook` as the notebook is now separate from ipython. That won't help for your issue though. \r\n\r\n2) ZMQ raises an unknown error, so it's hard to know what's happening. Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling ZMQ ? How are you install Jupyter/IPython ? pip ? Which Python distribution  ? Conda ? \r\nAre you on a machine with limited privileges ? If you have an antivirus/firewall can you disable temporarily and retry ?"

I can't find the relevant line in [the source code for pyzmq 16.0.2](https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/blob/v16.0.2/zmq/eventloop/ioloop.py#L175-L183), so there might be some issue there. Check that your $PATH is correct. @minrk have you seen that in pyzmq ? Is there a way to get an error number maybe to get more insight ?\r\n"

    "body": "I think this unknown error case occurs when a zmq API call fails, raising ZMQError, but libzmq fails to set an errno (or a weird errno is set or the errno has been consumed somehow before it is retrieved). It's a pretty weird situation to be in and I haven't seen it recently. You can retrieve the errno with `zmq.zmq_errno()`. I would guess that it's zero in this case, though. It might be useful if it's another value, though, so it's a good idea to retrieve it."
