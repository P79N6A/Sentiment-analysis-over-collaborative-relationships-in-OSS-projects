    "body": "@robyoung Hi! here is what I would like to do on this PR.  \n\nBoth you and Zach (@Zsailer) have been working on this and I want to see if we can combine your work.  Here is my current idea on how to do that.\n\nZach has created an IPEP here:\n\nhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPEP-16%3A-Notebook-multi-directory-dashboard-and-URL-mapping\n\nthat is helping us to work through the URL scheme for the multiple directories.  Please help us with that discussion (this discussion is on the ipython-dev list).\n\nOnce we finish this discussion, I would like Zach to implement all of that from the server side of things (in the notebook manager and handlers).  I will probably have him pull some of your server side code into that if it makes sense.  Once that is done I would like to see if you can adapt what you have done here on the frontend to the server changes.  It is a little challenging when multiple people have been working on something, but this is (I think) both of your first contributions to IPython, so I would love to keep you both going on this.\n"
