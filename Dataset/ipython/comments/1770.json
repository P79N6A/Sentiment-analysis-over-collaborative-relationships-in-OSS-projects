This is going to be really awesome.\n\nOne quick note: I think we should get into the habit of writing a standalone test file for these.  There's a clean enough API now to call the cell magics that writing a proper test should be very straightforward, and it will make it much easier to build trust in the system in the long haul, if each extension has a nice little test file along with it.\n"

I know we have no time to go back and fix everything that exists, and the notebook is perfect documentation (though we need to figure out how to include them more clearly in our docs, but that's for another day).  So it can be a simple page with just a paragraph and a brief list of the magics, and a sentence that says 'in the directory so and so, a detailed notebook is provided that shows the use of these functions'.\n\nLet's create a new section in the docs, Extensions, and drop a short summary of this one to get the ball rolling.  That way it will be easier to update later with short descriptions for the others.  It shouldn't take more than a few minutes, and once we solve the problem of linking notebooks in the docs, it will serve as a reference point for people to discover what's  available, and then go to the individual notebooks with hands-on explanation.\n"
