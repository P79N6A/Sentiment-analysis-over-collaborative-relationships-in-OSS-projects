    "body": "@pv, this looks great, many thanks for resurrecting it!  The only thing I'd like to ask for is some testing... I know this one is tricky to test, but we should be able to come up with something.\n\nAlso, you may want to refactor the functionality so that the magics are just thin wrappers that call self-contained library functions.  That will make it much easier to test them, especially if they don't really need the entire ipython instance.\n\nOnce we can sort out some form of testing for this, we'll proceed with merging it, because there's no doubt we want the functionality.\n"
