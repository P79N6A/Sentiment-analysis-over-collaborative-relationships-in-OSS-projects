    "body": "IPython serialization is pluggable - it works with anything that can serialize the same data types as JSON (I use msgpack in my profile).  The only reason we use JSON as the default is that it is in the standard library.\n\nTo use bson, add this to your `ipython_config.py`:\n\n``` python\nc.Session.packer = 'bson.dumps'\nc.Session.unpacker = 'bson.loads'\n```\n"
