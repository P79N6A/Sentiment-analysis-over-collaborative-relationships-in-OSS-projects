    "body": "Thanks for the PR @lesley2958, and you are right the documentation was inaccurate; we appreciate the time you took to write that up with example ! \r\n\r\nAs @takluyver pointed out this document is not in markdown but RST. Markdown is great for small self contained document but RST give us way more flexibility, so you should use `::` followed by 3 or 4 space indent for example.\r\n\r\nI fixed that for you and pushed a new commit on your branch, and now that's look good. We'll let you some time to look at the changes we made to your branch, and if all is clear we can get that in to have this brand new documentation to our end users.\r\n\r\nI also realize that the email you use for your git commit does not match the email you use with GitHub and might be an email autogenerated from your username/host name. This means that you may not get due credit in the GitHub UI for your contribution. Do you want guidance to fix this; or is it ok as is ?"

    "body": "> @Carreau hmm, not sure what you mean about the email!\r\n\r\nNo worries, sorry to be unclear, if you issue a `git log` you will see the following (redacted in case you decide later to make your email private):\r\n\r\n```\r\ncommit 1688a5e57d01fc290615d32f24cba8c78dd5bf11 (HEAD, origin/pr/10891)\r\nAuthor: Lesley Cordero <{username}@Lesleys-MacBook-Pro.local>\r\nDate:   Sun Dec 24 13:28:37 2017 -0500\r\n\r\n    changed return to print and fixed example code\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see your email is set to `<{username}@Lesleys-MacBook-Pro.local>` while your profile says `{username}@columbia.edu`\r\n\r\nThis also lead in the GitHub UI to \"Anonymous\" commits:\r\n<img width=\"169\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-01-03 at 11 40 21\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335567/34517352-ee68041e-f07a-11e7-9c3e-26cd154ad77f.png\">\r\n\r\nIf you had setup git with your actual email you signed in with github it would show as follow:\r\n<img width=\"233\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-01-03 at 11 41 22\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335567/34517394-22a5c694-f07b-11e7-8815-6abc187222b3.png\">\r\n\r\nCorrectly crediting you as the author.\r\n\r\nUsually on your Machine you want to follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/) to correctly attach your name and email to commits.\r\n\r\nOnce this is done we can show you how to \"fix\" your already existing commits so that they appear as yours. \r\n\r\nThis is not important for us, but if you want your open-source contributions to be more visible for your professional career, it may be something to consider setting.\r\n\r\n> new pull request is submitted though -- sorry about the lateness, got caught up with midterms, projects, and finals\r\n\r\nNo need to apologies for the delay, we're all busy and this is good work. As a small note, we tend to not merge master branch into feature branch to get a more linear history. So this PR may need a rebase. We can do it for you if you are still unfamiliar with advance git techniques, or can guide you through doing it. \r\n\r\n"
