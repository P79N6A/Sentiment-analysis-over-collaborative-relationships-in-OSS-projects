Further analysis shows that I get an error in the javascript window that seems to be related to:\n\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/pull/62\n\nI.e. when `Reveal.initialize()` is called, it has not yet been defined. I somehow managed to edit the html so that the error does not happen and my slides appear. :-) My presentation is saved tomorrow. \n\nBut there definitely is a race between the external script and the internal call to `Reveal.initialize()`\n"

    "body": "Hi all, I am using `jupyter-nbconvert` installed via Anaconda. I am trying to create my first ever slide show using this toolset:\n\n```\n$ /anaconda3/bin/jupyter-nbconvert --version\n4.1.0\n$ ~/anaconda3/bin/jupyter-nbconvert --post serve --to slides dmwp-slides.ipynb \n```\n\n On the browser, I get `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'initialize' of undefined`. I suspect it's the same issue? I tried Reveal-3.3, and 2.6.2 as well.\n\nMy notebook is here: https://github.com/doingmathwithpython/pycon-us-2016/blob/master/notebooks/slides.ipynb\n"
