    "body": "That looks like pip is warning you about some packages that aren't installed and some that are installed but too old. If those warnings are right, then that's expected behaviour - though I haven't seen it before. Are you using a beta version of pip 10? If the warnings are wrong (i.e. you do have those packages installed, or you have newer versions than pip says), that's a bug in pip."
