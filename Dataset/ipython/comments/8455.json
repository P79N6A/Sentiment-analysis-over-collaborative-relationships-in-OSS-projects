    "body": "The character in the top example is U+2013, 'EN DASH'. The operator for subtraction in Python, and in almost all programming languages, is U+002D, 'HYPHEN-MINUS'. This should be what you get when you hit the dash key on the keyboard, but I know e.g. Word will autocorrect it to en dash depending on what other characters are around it. I'm surprised that Sublime seems to be doing that. But I don't think it's a bug in IPython - the top example really is invalid syntax. A code-oriented text editor should not be turning hyphen-minus into en dash.\n"
