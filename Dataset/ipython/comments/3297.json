We won't know this until the work on nbconvert is further along.\n- How do we want to expose the nbconvert capabilities in the notebook app.  This is a bigger question that relates to a number of design questions that we need to work out. For example, how do we expose exporting notebooks to different formats? Will we even have the notion of automatically exporting to a given format each time a notebook is saved?  Again, we can't do this until we know more of what nbconvert will look like.\n"
