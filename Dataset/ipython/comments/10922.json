As far as I'm concerned, silently setting self.starting_dir to None when the getcwd() fails looks fine."

I guess creating the embedded shell could throw an error with a more explanatory message. But if you want some nicer behaviour, I think it's up to your application to check for the cwd and change directory if necessary."
