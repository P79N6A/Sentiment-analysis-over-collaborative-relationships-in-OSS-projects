    "body": "It turns out, this isn't in my changes at all, it's the fact that post-execute functions are [unregistered](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py#L2427) on any exception (including KeyboardInterrupt).  This is indeed easily fixed.  There are two obvious options:\n1. never deactivate post-execute hooks on KeyboardInterrupt\n2. catch KeyboardInterrupt in `flush_figures` itself\n\nI think 1. makes more sense, and is trivially fixed.  I'll do a PR with this in a minute, adding some cleanup in the backend to make sure that the state is cleared, even if `flush_figures()` is interrupted.\n"
