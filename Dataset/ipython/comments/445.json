    "body": "Yes, I suppose we can print a message during build if an older IPython is found.  The problem is, with Python this is perfectly valid - you can have a dozen versions of IPython installed, and if you do, it's up to you to keep them in order.\n\nThe diagnosis is (for all Python modules, not just IPython): if a script raises ImportErrors on its own packages, the most likely culprit is that the startup script on your PATH does not match the first package found on your PYTHONPATH (or sys.path).\n"
