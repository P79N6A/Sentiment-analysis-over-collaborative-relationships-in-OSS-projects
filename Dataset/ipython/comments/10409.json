    "body": "@Carreau @minrk Thank you both for your help. I upgraded to `virtualenv==15.1.0` and now the tests all pass. It turns out that you were correct, the `enum.py` file was missing and creating new environments with the older version of `virtualenv` failed to pull in everything it should have so I upgraded and everything works.\r\n[ipython_test3.txt](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/files/876889/ipython_test3.txt)\r\n"
