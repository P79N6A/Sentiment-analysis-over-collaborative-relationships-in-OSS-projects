    "body": "Thanks, this seems to solve my problem!\n\nI see a minor problem with renaming, though. I use `.md` files for notebooks in my custom IPython extension; renaming them in the notebook UI seems to mess up the name, and to enforce the `.ipynb` file extension. I'm not sure whether I can change this JavaScript logic through my extension. I suppose this is the kind of problems brought by relaxing the assumption that all notebooks must have a `.ipynb` file extension.\n"

There has been a warning on the redirect since 2.0.\n\nI don't think we should provide any warnings or migrations in notebook conversion, because of two things:\n1. it means parsing and modifying HTML in markdown, html, and outputs.\n2. having 'files/' in a URL is perfectly valid if a 'files' directory exist. When nbconvert is run, it doesn't know that the notebook file's current context (it may not be a file at all, it may be coming from in-memory) is the one where the static html will be served, so it is not possible to know if it should be modified or not.\n"
