For a big notebook, with lots of graphical output in the results, sometimes it takes a long time to open the notebook on a slow connection. If e.g. you've got a loop producing plots, its possible to accidentally make far too many plots, and then have a massive notebook file that takes forever to open. Some kind of \"clear output\" button on the home menu screen would be awesome.\n"
