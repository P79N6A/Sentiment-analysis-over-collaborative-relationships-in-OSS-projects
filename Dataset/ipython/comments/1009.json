Unicode escapes are still processed in raw\nunicode literals, so I think it will fail on any folder beginning with u or\nU, such as Users.\n\nIn fact, this will probably affect any magic command with the substring \\u\nor \\U, but cd is the most common case. Perhaps we should replace \\ with \\,\nand not construct a raw string literal. i.e. use `u\"cd c:\\\\Users\\\\myname\"`\nrather than `ur\"cd c:\\Users\\myname\"`.\n"

In fact, if it's really this that we are producing:\n\n```\n`u'get_ipython().magic(ur\"cd c:\\\\Users\\\\myname\")\\n'`\n```\n\nthen we're simply doing it wrong; it looks like we're both escaping _and_ making it a raw literal, and that's the bug.  By escaping it out we duplicate the \\, but since it's raw, the second one gets interpreted as a unicode escape instead of a backslash.  We should either escape OR make it raw, but not both.\n"

    "body": "Well, it's the clash with the years-old convenience of using space as an argument separator.  Since the spacebar is the easiest key to hit, cmd line environments made the choice of using spaces into the default, universal argument separator (instead of commas like programming languages use).  But that meant having to escape spaces all the time.  And it means that string splitting logic must be very careful because it must avoid splitting when escapes are present.  That's why it's so easy to get code that works with spaces at one level, but once that code calls something else things break, because the escaping at one level is lost at the next...\n\nIn any case, we should make it as easy as possible for people to cd, that's for sure :)\n"
