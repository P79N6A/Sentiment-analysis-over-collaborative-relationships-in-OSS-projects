We do intend to remove this dependency (see #539), but it is probably going to take an actual Windows user/developer (of which there are zero on the IPython team) to do it.\n"

It doesn't do anything clever in the comparison, it just compares the lists.\n\nThe decision to remove str/int comparison in Python 3 seems a very bad one, to me.\n\npyzmq 2.1.10 skirts this issue itself by adding a pyzmq_version_info() function for returning a tuple of numbers, turning 'dev' into `inf`, so it can always be used in comparisons.\n"
