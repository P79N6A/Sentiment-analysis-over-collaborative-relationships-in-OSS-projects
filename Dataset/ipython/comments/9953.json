    "body": "Great !\nThat seem to be a good fix !\n\nI'll let some time to other dev to have a look. \n\nA few comments on how to make your contribution even better for subsequent fixes.\n\nIt's not easy here, but sometime we try to come up with a unit-test to make sure it does not break later.\nOne way we could do that here, is to refactor the following:\n\n```\n          if breakpoint:\n             (filename, bp_line) = breakpoint.rsplit(':', 1)\n              bp_line = int(bp_line)\n          else:\n              (filename, bp_line) = (None, None)\n```\n\ninto a function, for example `_get_filename_and_line`, use it, and test it. \nUp to you if you like to try do that. \n\nHere it's a pretty some simple fix so there is no need to but you can also add an `rst` file into `docs/source/whatsnew/pr/` folder that will end-up in the what's new notes. \n\n That was some tips to make your code even better and how we could have done it. \n\nA GitHub tip as well. \n\nWhen you make your message commit you can use the phrase `Fixes #9932` for example. \nThat will automatically link your pull request with the target issue, and when your fix is merged the issue will be automatically closed !\n\nAnd last improvement you can try next time when writing your commit message, \n\nTry to describe _why_ you do some changes instead of which changes you are doing. This is extremely useful when trying to understand code or why a bug appear in some line a few month or years later. In particular here with the diff it is pretty easy to see you changed `split` to `rsplit`, a better commit message might be:\n\n> Fix breakpoint linenumber detection on Windows.\n> \n> Change `split` to `rsplit` as windows paths can contain `:` when including drive letters. \n\nThis should close  #9932, @jlumpe you reported the issue would that suit you ?\n\nThanks !\n"
