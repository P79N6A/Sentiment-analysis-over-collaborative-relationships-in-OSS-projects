    "body": "Basically, you just need to add this code to any startup file in your profile:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nfrom prompt_toolkit.keys import Keys\r\nfrom prompt_toolkit.key_binding.bindings.completion import generate_completions\r\n\r\nip = get_ipython()\r\nbind_key = ip.pt_cli.application.key_bindings_registry.add_binding\r\nbind_key(Keys.ControlSpace)(generate_completions)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should really always check that you're running the terminal with PTK before you run that code though. Something like this should work:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\ndef register_bindings():\r\n\r\n    from prompt_toolkit.keys import Keys\r\n    from prompt_toolkit.key_binding.bindings.completion import generate_completions\r\n\r\n    bind_key = ip.pt_cli.application.key_bindings_registry.add_binding\r\n    bind_key(Keys.ControlSpace)(generate_completions)\r\n\r\nip = get_ipython()\r\nif getattr(ip, \"pt_cli\"): register_bindings()\r\ndel register_bindings\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: You could put the registration logic in an if-block, but using a function stops names like `bind_key` leaking into your session's namespace. Once you have a bunch of bindings and custom filters defined, you end up creating quite a lot of names that you would otherwise have to delete manually. Putting it all in a function, then deleting the function's name is cleaner. For the simple case above, an if-block would probably be better."
