    "body": "No, PySide is not a requirement - it works with either PySide or PyQt.  PySide is just a much quicker install, since it has a binary installer, and is the default choice when both are present.\n\nI just installed PyQt (4.8.6) with homebrew, and the clipboard still works when I instruct IPython to use PyQt instead of PySide.  So maybe it's something to do with your Python?  How did you install your Python, and are you certain that homebrew built PyQt with yours, rather than the system one?\n\nYou might try finding a simple clipboard test app from some pyqt tutorial to isolate the issue.\n"
