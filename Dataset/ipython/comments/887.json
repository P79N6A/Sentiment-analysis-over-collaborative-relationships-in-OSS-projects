I'm mixing up when moving by searching in a file...\n\nAnd by the way, the police found finger print ( a woman at first look according to one of them ) , which they told me  was pretty rare as thieves oven wear gloves.\nI've also learn that they have 2 kind of powder for fingerprint: black for clear object and white for dark object !\n\nsee you soon hopefully.\n```\n"

A few things of note:\n- the menu hide action isn't working, whether triggered from the Window menu or the kbd.  Don't know why.\n- No keybindings to navigate between tabs.  Ctrl-PgUp/PgDown should do that.\n\nOther than these two, I think from the user side this is good to go (I'm going to make some tiny wording fixes in a second).  @Carreau, if you have some suggestions or can find a bit of time/resources to pitch in, that would be great.\n\n@epatters, what's your take on the internals regarding the Qt code?  I won't merge this until you give it the final all-clear, so your input would be very welcome.\n"

At first, the logic was just backwards (a miscreant 'not', easily found and fixed), but Qt has an interesting behavior: When the MenuBar is set as invisible, all shortcuts attached to it are no longer accessible.  So hiding the menu bar means making it impossible to activate any of the shortcuts (including showing the menu bar again).\n\nI can fix this easily enough, by attaching all menu bar actions to the application itself as well, to preserve their availability.\n"

It's the only one using meta, and Ctrl-Shift-M is already used for menubar toggle in apps like konsole.\n- The tab nav keybindings are backwards from the behavior on chrome and firefox: pgup should go left, pgdown should go right.\n- There's a strange focus bug: open several tabs, then close one with C-w.  The focus doesn't return to the window so it's impossible to type.  I have to switch focus to a _different_ window and back to the console to recover focus.  No amount of clicking on the qtconsole helps.  A visual cue of the problem is that the blinking cursor disappears.\n- I was wondering if we should change the close action on the whole window to ask about closing all tabs, and shutting them all down if affirmative.  Right now if you have 10 tabs open, there's no way to close them all without answering 'yes' 10 times.\n\nAwesome job, Min.  This is almost ready to go, I'm excited.  It makes the qt console a really appealing environment.\n"

I assume that's Ctrl-Q on Linux.\n\nOf course, it is supposed to already be at the bottom of File, but I inverted the `sys.platform != darwin` check so I could test on my mac, but never put it back.

I'll try on Linux after dinner.  I haven't seen the focus bug in OSX, and printing works fine.\n"

I see F11 on gnome-terminal.\n> \n> There is no 'full screen' shortcut (in my knowledge ) on Mac, so I put one I use in a terminal, I may have missed a \n> Qt.Shortcut.Fullscreen. Fxx Keys are not directly accessible on newest mac, bind to volumes control for example\n\nOSX may not have a perfectly uniform standard, but cmd-ctrl-F is very common (Preview, Chrome, Safari, GitX), and approximately 100% of the exceptions to this are apps that use cmd-opt-F or cmd-shift-F, so I think there's a well established reference.\n\n> BTW, i just though of a 'bug' : tab names are based on number of open tabs.\n> It might mess up names if you closes tab without closing kernels. We might prefer counting the number of opened kernel...\n\nright you are - open two tabs, close the first, open a third, and you have two tabs labeled 'kernel 1'.  easy fix is to just use a monotonic counter.\n"
