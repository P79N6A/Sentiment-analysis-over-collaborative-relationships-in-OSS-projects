    "body": "Wouldn't it be better for that file to be created with tempfile instead of having a fixed 'tasks.db' name?  That way, a stray `/tmp/tasks.db` file can't cause problems.  A scenario where that could occur: user 1 runs the suite before this cleanup fix or with a crash that for some reason prevents cleanup, then user 2 on the same machine can't run the tests anymore because he can't create/write to `/tmp/tasks.db`.  Making that filename with the tempfile machinery will prevent this, it can be simply a module-level global created in `setup()` and deleted in `teardown()` just like now, but with a random name made by tempfile.\n"
