It's not the 21 lines of the default R console prompt:\n\n```\n$ R\n\nR version 3.2.1 (2015-06-18) -- \"World-Famous Astronaut\"\nCopyright (C) 2015 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing\nPlatform: x86_64-apple-darwin14.3.0 (64-bit)\n\nR is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.\nYou are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.\nType 'license()' or 'licence()' for distribution details.\n\n  Natural language support but running in an English locale\n\nR is a collaborative project with many contributors.\nType 'contributors()' for more information and\n'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.\n\nType 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or\n'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.\nType 'q()' to quit R.\n\n> q()\n```\n\nbut they are there for a reason.  I think we can tighten the info as proposed above into \n\n`Type '?', '%quickref' or 'help' for help, and 'object?'/'object??' for object details`\n\nwhich will save a few lines, that sounds very good, if people want to go in that direction...\n\nBut again, people who really want minimalism, should just keep in their `.bashrc`:\n\n```\nalias ip='ipython --no-banner'\n```\n\nless to type, less to see, less to remember ;)\n\nCheers\n\nf\n"

It doesn't bother me personally, but maybe we should ask people who actually see it every time they launch ipython. \n\nAnd as a side note, I'm also interested in knowing if the new users read the help lines and type those things when having trouble or just look their issues up in StackOverflow. Looks like they are there for them and feedback on this would be great.\n"
