    "body": "a few points:\n- IPython has no awareness of HDF5 at all\n- the IPython kernel is not compiled, it is pure Python\n\nSo it is highly unlikely that there is anything related to IPython involved in the issue here.  I would bring it up with the actual Python libraries that are using HDF5.  It may be that some _compiled_ extensions, such as pytables, were built when you had older HDF5, then you updated the library without recompiling your Python extensions that linked against it.  This may cause the issue you are seeing, in which case the answer would be to recompile the relevant Python extensions (perhaps pytables, maybe pandas, etc.)\n"
