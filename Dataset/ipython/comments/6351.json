    "body": "@jhemmelg @KesterTong Kester and I talked about this PR when I visited NYC. Overall, we are very interested in seeing this merged.\n\nThere are a couple of issue with the current state of the PR:\n- We can't merge PRs that have merged from master. This creates a total mess of the git DAG and makes it very difficult to review as you see commits from master mixed into the PR. Unfortunately, the solution (unless a git ninja has a better idea) is to start with a clean branch that is updated to ipython/master (don't use your master branch - always keep that in sync with ipython/master) and then transfer all of these changes by hand to that new branch. If ipython/master changes in the mean time do \"git rebase master\" rather than \"git merge master\" to keep the DAG clean.\n- It needs to wait until after the nbformat4 stuff is landed.\n\nI am going to close for now until these two things are addressed. Once you properly rebase the changes, feel free to reopen so we can start to review, even if the nbformat 4 stuff is not in master yet.\n"
