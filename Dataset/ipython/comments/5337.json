    "body": "- Other than `pi`, I have no objection to removing those stale examples from parallel. They are mostly super old (some from pre-zmq rewrite), and entirely redundant. The newer ones were just dumped from a demo I did while I was doing the zmq rewrite.\n- I think it's odd that we have `examples/Category/Examples` If anything in `examples` is not an example, then `examples` doesn't make sense as the top-level name.  If we really do want to transition most of the docs here, maybe this should be the new `docs`.\n- I would drop `embed_class_short.py`, but keep the longer one. If you want to do any customization of behavior, you really do have to instantiate InteractiveShellEmbed. `IPython.embed` only covers trivial cases.\n\n> What do we do with the tests directories. Is there a better place for them?\n\nWe could put them in `tools/`\n"
