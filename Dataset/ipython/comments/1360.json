    "body": "Ah, yes, good catch.  As I understand it, it's not quite Python 2.7 that is required, but Python >= 2.6.5.\n\nIn any case, this bug was introduced by PR #1332, which made all of the handler patterns unicode, which results in unicode keys in the kwargs dict.\n\nThere are two fixes:\n1. coerce our URL patterns to str.  This is probably the easiest, but _technically_ nonascii urls are valid, and I just don't know what would happen, or how to set up a situation to test that (e.g. a proxy with nonascii base URL)\n2. tornado should coerce unicode keys to str [here](https://github.com/facebook/tornado/blob/master/tornado/web.py#L1345).\n\nSince we obviously want to work with released tornado, we have to do something on our end to ensure that our URL patterns are not unicode.  The simplest possible answer is to simply enforce ascii, but that does break unlikely, if technically possible, use cases.\n"
