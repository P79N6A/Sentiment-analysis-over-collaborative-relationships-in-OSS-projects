If\nyou open an older notebook in IPython 3, it will update it and save in the\nnewer format (you'll see a message saying that this has happened).\nLikewise, if you open a new format notebook (from IPython 3) in IPython\n2.4, it will downgrade it to the older format. The format used didn't\nchange between 2.2 and 2.4.\n\nIf you want to explicitly convert notebooks at the command line, you can\nuse IPython 3 with a command like: ipython nbconvert --to notebook\n--nbformat 3 MyNotebook.ipynb . IPython 2 uses nbformat 3, and IPython 3\nuses nbformat 4.\n\nThomas\n"
