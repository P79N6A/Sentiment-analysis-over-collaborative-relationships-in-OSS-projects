    "body": "OK, I figured it out. The solution (not just for IPython, but for installying _any_ python package that has scripts in a virtualenv) is to do the build step separately:\n\n```\n./setup.py build --executable \"/usr/bin/env python\"\n./setup.py install\n```\n\nThis sets the shebang line correctly once the scripts get installed.\n\nSince this is standard distutils,  I think we can actually close the issue here.  Feel free to put this tip up on the faq, as it's certainly not very obvious.  I had an inkling of the solution because I had a vague memory of being able to control that line years ago when I was building RPMs with distutils for a lab where I had a bunch of Fedora machines.  But otherwise it's not easy to just stumble upon this solution.\n"

Virtualenv changed the default behaviour from --system-site-packages to --no-site-packages. For IPython this means that when you run it from a terminal where the virtualenv is in your path, it will not pick up the ipython libs.
