Then it sounds like the answer is to change permissions during whatever step stages to .../share/doc, but not the source examples themselves, since those should remain executable.

So what's the final decision, @tomspur: do we leave the scripts executable and accept the dependency on `env` (probably something everybody haves, so it doesn't worry me at all), or do you want to make the changes so that the scripts get chmodded at install time?  The latter is a lot more work, so I vote for the former.\n\nFeel free to do a forced push that removes the commit making the chmod changes, rather than doing and undoing them.\n"
