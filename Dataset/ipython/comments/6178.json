I think it wound be better to put custom templates like that in separate package than could be  updated from outside of IPython. Also it will allow to use them with earlier version of IPython. What does @damianavila think ? \n"

    "body": "Thanks for the PR! And sorry for the delay...\nThis is nice... and an interesting way to deal with all the config options inside reveal. It is very tempting to incorporate this to master because it is only using the slideshow metadata with prior defaults... so, naive users does not get affected at all, but advanced users can customized a lot of things in a very, very simple way.\n@Carreau has also raised a valid point. If we do this an independent package, it could be useful for other people using earlier version of the IPython slides.\nMaybe we can discuss this issue at the dev meeting to hear what other developers think about this.\nI will add it to the hackpad.\n"

I also wanted some feedback on the naming/placement of the formatting metadata (i.e. is it acceptable to create a sub-section \"slideshow\" to contain formatting options).\n\nAlso, although I haven't really had chance to look in to it, some tweaking of the nbconvert default css may be required. For example, if you look at the example notebook I put together, on slides with a background any text contained in <code><\\code> tags have a solid white background to them making the slides quite ugly. No doubt there are other formatting/layout issues to be addressed.\n\nI must admit I'm not a web dev guy, css/jinja/javascript are a bit out of my comfort zone, so any conclusions I have jumped to might be way off.\n\nCheers\n"
