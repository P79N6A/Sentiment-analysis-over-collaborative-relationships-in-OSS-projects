The group looking at it in the meeting found that just prohibiting a cache-size of 0 didn't work, but I'm not sure if this is the best way to do it - maybe the displayhook should always include the execution counter in the message? The [messaging spec](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/development/messaging.html#python-outputs) doesn't say that it's optional.\n"

Historically, it's quite possible the implementation messed up and tied these two things together, but they should be separate.  The `Out` structure and `_NN` automatic variables may not exist without caching, but the notion of a monotonically increasing counter is always valid, and especially important in the context of connected notebook clients, that really need this number to provide a visual cue to the user about the order he's executed his cells in.\n\n@takluyver, it seems this PR should be changed slightly to include changes [pointed by @minrk](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/zmq/displayhook.py#L58), right?  @Tobias1087, let us know if you need a hand with this...\n\nIt seems with just a bit of work we should be able to wrap this one up pretty soon; thanks @Tobias1087 for the contribution!\n"
