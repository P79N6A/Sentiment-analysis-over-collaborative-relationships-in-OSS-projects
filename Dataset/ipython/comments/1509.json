[*]\n  - one time : classical tooltip \n  - two : expand the tooltip  (equivalent than clicking `+`button)\n  - three: make the tooltip 'sticky' for 10 sec (won't be discarded by keyboard input)\n  - four : exec `function?` on behalf of the current cell  (equivalent than clicking `^` button)[**]\n\n[*] If you are ok with that behaviour, I can write that somewhere in the docs/ notebook example. \n[**] When the widget API is in place I would like to change this thing, because it increments the prompt number of the cell.\n\n[edit] for the record, conflicting commit was 0960f3ba ~L23 , add of `this.clear_out_timeout = null;`[/edit]\n"
