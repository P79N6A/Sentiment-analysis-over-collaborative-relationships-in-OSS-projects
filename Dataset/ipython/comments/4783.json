    "body": "- The link problem is annoying - the file is there on Github, but for some reason it's not rendered. I'll try rebuilding the docs, see if that fixes it.\n- The pidigits example is evidently not Python 3 compatible yet. I've just made some more of the examples Python 3 compliant, but I didn't touch the parallel stuff. Do you want to have a go at porting it?\n- We don't really have anything that new or upgrading users are likely to read. We thought about popping up a dialog the first time you use it, but it's surprisingly hard to detect first use. There's some description in the keyboard shortcuts dialog - we hope people might look at that if they're confused.\n"
