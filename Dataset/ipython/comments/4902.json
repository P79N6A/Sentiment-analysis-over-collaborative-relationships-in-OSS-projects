    "body": "Can this issue be re-opened?  \n\nInstalling latest Node.js does not solve the problem with print-preview not finding custom.css.   Since print-preview creates the preview html in different subfolders folders it is not practical to copy the custom.css to every folder (even if I did know where that is).\n\nTo reproduce:\n\nPut something like:\n\n```\n<style>\ntable.kstop{\n    border-width: 1px;\n    border-spacing: 2px;\n    border-style: hidden;\n    border-color: white;\n    border-collapse: separate;\n    background-color: white;\n}</style>\n```\n\nin custom.css\nThen create a notebook with table html in a markdown cell.\n\n```\n <table class='kstop'>\n    <tr><td class='contact'>John Doe          </td> </tr>\n    <tr><td class='contact' >Engineering</td></tr>\n    </table>\n```\n\nWhen viewed normally in Notebook table has no borders, but in print preview it has borders because custom.css can not be found.\n"

    "body": "Hi @ksmith13 ,\n\nThanks for the feedback.  The print preview does not include the users custom CSS because of implementation details (nbconvert generates the preview HTML).  Adding that feature is a separate topic, which I'll bring up at tomorrow's dev meeting.\n\nThe issue described here, although mentioning _custom.css_, is actually referring to the _custom.css_ internal to the IPython installation (**not** user custom CSS).  The solution was:\n\n> using a more recent version of node\n\nThis is what the PR I linked addresses, and is what was causing the problem in this issue.\n"
