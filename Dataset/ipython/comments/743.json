    "body": "This looks good overall, but I can't seem to close the window of the demo applet when I run it.  Do you know why?  Ideally, we'd offer users the ability to run a script, close all of its windows and then run it again as many times as they want, without ever losing the interactive shell.  That works right now for the wx/gtk/qt event loops, so let's try to get the two GL ones in similar shape, if possible.\n\nAlso, fixing the wx references Min pointed out would be good.\n\nFinally, if you can figure out what's going on with the window closing, we only have one more issue to sort out: any option supported by the gui magic should also be supported by the --gui command-line flag, so users can start ipython in gui mode if they want to from the beginning.\n\nThe code that defines these options is here:\nhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/frontend/terminal/ipapp.py#L232\n\nso it should gain a 'pyglet' option.  Once that is working, it should be 100% equivalent to type at the system shell:\n\n<pre>\nipython --gui pyglet\n</pre>\n\nor at the IPython prompt:\n\n<pre>\n%gui pyglet\n</pre>\n\n\nThanks a lot for the good work!  I realize these GL event loops are proving a little hard to get right, but hopefully we can finish the process and merge both of your pull requests.  We just want to make sure they work reliably and correctly in the intended manner.  If ultimately some of it can't be made to work that's OK, but then we'd want to add code that informs the user in a visible manner what the limitations are of a given GL option.\n"
