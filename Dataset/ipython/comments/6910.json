For me it was Inkscape killing SVG by setting the mime type to `application/svg`.\n\nTry this:\n\n``` Python\nimport mimetypes\nmimetypes.guess('file.css')\n```\n\nYou should get `text/css`. If you get `application/css` this is most likely your problem.\nMy solution: Change back the mime type association. Start `regedit` and search for `application/css` in `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`. Replace it with `text/css`.\n"
