    "body": "It's great to see people making creative use of the magic system, but this does raise a question about how much we want to ship as part of IPython. We do have an [extension system](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/config/extensions/index.html), and my inclination is that this belongs as a separate extension. Others may disagree, though.\n\nYour concerns:\n- Sphinx is BSD licensed, and so long as that covers whichever extension it's from, we can borrow their code. We should include a copyright notice from Sphinx, though, and a note that we're using it under a BSD license.\n- `klass.__name__` and `klass.__module__` seem to cover it.\n"

We'll see if anyone else weighs in.\n\nMy own feeling is that it would be best to do this as a separate extension for now, so that you can easily work on it and make more frequent updates than IPython's release schedule. Installing an extension is very simple with the `%install_ext` command. If %hierarchy becomes widely used, we could look at including it to save people that installation step.\n"
