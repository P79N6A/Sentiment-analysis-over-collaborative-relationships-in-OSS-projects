    "body": "Yes, I will add docstrings this afternoon. In short `instance_init` was doing multiple things\n- instantiating (and therefore validating right away) the default values of the `TraitType` instance.\n- decorating the `TraitType` instance\n  - using functions such as `_resolve_classes`\n  - or by setting the `this_class` of the sub-traits for container types.\n  - or both\n\n`instance_init` has been decomposed into two functions: `static_init` on the one hand which does the first part and `decorate` on the other hand which does the second part. \n\nThe base trait type has an empty `decorate` function which may be overloaded by other trait types, hence I could remove the test for existence of `_resolve_classes` for example, which are specific to certain type of traits. \n\nNow, the goal is to deffer the execution of `static_init` as much as possible. Initially, the constructor of HasTrait was calling instance_init for all traits. Now it only calls static_init at this point only if a value is provided for the considered attribute. (Actually it calls set_default_value which hooks up potential `_%s_default` functions). In the case where it is not called at this point, no default value has been instantiated. The default value is only created and validated the first time it is accessed line 419\n"

    "body": "Great, thanks for the explanation. I think `decorate` is part of what's tripping me up. `decorate` means something in Python, and it's not what is going on here. It seems like the basics of finishing initialization once there is an instance associated. Is `decorate` always called? If so, I might leave it called `instance_init`, and then separate the _value_ initialization (now in static_init) from the Trait initialization, which I think is the actual goal here. If that's the case, I would probably leave `decorate` as `instance_init`, and call `static_init` something like `static_default_value` or `init_default_value`.\n"

    "body": "The failing tests are real, but due to a slightly pathological behavior in the in-process kernel init.\n\nThe in-process kernel asks for traits passed in kwargs _before_ calling `super().__init__`.\n\nA test case:\n\n``` python\nfrom IPython.utils.traitlets import HasTraits, Instance\n\nclass C(HasTraits):\n    t = Instance(int, allow_none=False)\n\n    def _t_default(self):\n        return 5\n\n    def __init__(self, **kwargs):\n        print(self.t)\n        super().__init__(self, **kwargs)\n\nC() # works, t=5\nC(t=2) # Fails with t is None, but allow_none=False\n```\n1. `HasTraits.__new__` sees that `t` is given in kwargs, and thus skips `set_default_value`, preventing `_t_default` from being registered as an \n2. `C.__init__` requests `t`, but it hasn't been assigned yet, and `_t_default` was skipped, by the above, so `t.default_value()` is called instead, returning None.\n3. `super().__init__(**kw)` actually assigns c.t from kwargs, as expected.\n\nI don't think it's a problem that you cannot reliably access dynamic trait initialization before calling `HasTraits.__init__`, since nobody should really be doing that. I can remove the behavior in the in-process kernel without issue, I think.\n"
