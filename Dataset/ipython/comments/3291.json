    "body": "Wouldn't this be more appropriate as a git commit hook or something along ?\n\nThe goal of the ipynb format is to capture output and prompt number for conversion with nbconvert for example, or sharing with nbviewer (notebook shared with nbviewer without output are really desapointing imho).\n\nBut I do understand the wish to have it. Maybe the ability to have a post save hook is what you would like. \nIt could for example run a script that store the stripped version in another directory, and could also cover the need for the `--script` option.\n"
