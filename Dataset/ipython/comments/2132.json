    "body": "Pocoo turned off their pastebin, which we were using, so we switched the code to use gist, but that obviously won't affect older versions. I think he's suggesting that we maintain some kind of API that ipython will query to find a pastebin - then if gist goes offline, we can quickly update it, so users can keep using %pastebin without updating.\n\nA few problems I see with that:\n- Pastebins don't have a common API, so we need a description of how to post to them, as well as a URL. Delivering code from a web service has 'security vulnerability' written all over it. Pastebins built with LodgeIt will all have the same API, but as far as I know, that doesn't include any of the prominent ones.\n- As a group of enthusiasts, albeit sometimes with funding for particular projects, we're in a worse place to provide a continuously available web service than Github.\n- Any complex API could put extra load on your server, if a lot of people are using this.\n"
