I was working with `IPython v3.0.0` on `Python 2.7.11`. The issue happened after requesting info about `griddata`\n\n```\nfrom scipy.interpolate import griddata\ngriddata?\n```\n\nafter pressing `q` to return to the cell I had the problem that neither `del` nor `return` worked. I had to write a lot of letters until it accepted the `return` obviously causing an error.  I tried to replicate by just importing and executing on my other computer, but it didn't reproduce the error there. It seems it is something random. I will keep you posted if I am able to find a replicable example.\n"

The parts that aren't specific to Python (including the Qt console) got renamed to _Jupyter_.\n\nI'm going to close the issue here; if you still have problems with the new version of the Qt console, please file a new issue in the [jupyter/qtconsole repo](https://github.com/jupyter/qtconsole).\n"
