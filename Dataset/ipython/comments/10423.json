    "body": "Hi @keldLundgaard,\r\n\r\nThanks for your question here and on #2888; also, thanks for using Jupyter and IPython.\r\n\r\nReading the comments on the other issue, @Carreau's response lays out the technical reasons why this hasn't been implemented. I would like to be both responsive and practical as I look at your request. Tabs are a bit problematic since straightforward handling of them in the notebook (i.e. toggle) isn't trivial both due to architecture and the use for completion as well.\r\n\r\nI asked another core developer on the project, and this \"may\" be possible in a future post-beta JupyterLab release. It \"may\" also be possible for you to use 'nbconfig' to customize your personal profile for the notebook (https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/frontend_config.html).\r\n\r\nIs there a particular use case for why tabs are needed in the notebook cells (beyond convenience/consistency for you)? Perhaps a bit more information about your use case would generate other options.\r\n\r\nThanks! - Carol\r\n"
