I think the \"User Interface\" notebook at this point would be a better place for this though, but that notebook and the one you modified probably need to be cleaned up a bit as the cover some of the same stuff.\n- We should get into the habit of putting things like this (JS code) into a cell that has to be run to get the JavaScript to run. People downloading our example notebooks won't have trusted them initially so the JS code won't run on load.\n- I think the yellow color is too jarring. It should be something clear but subtle. Maybe a light blue - which is a common color used to high light things in UIs.\n"

    "body": "Great work, and very useful! This is something we should actively promote for users...\n\nSome points that need attention:\n- If I go _back_ after having switched from command to edit mode, it still says \"you are in command mode\", but that's not true (I'm in edit mode). I think you're making the right state transitions when moving forward, but not back.\n- \"Mode Indicator\": I would word it instead of \"This indicator tells you which mode you are in.\" as \"In this area, an indicator can appear to tell you which mode you are in\". Otherwise, if you get there while in command mode, you read \"this indicator\" but the arrow is pointing to a blank area, which feels a bit confusing.\n- \"Mode indicator\": in command mode, it should say something like \"Right now you are in Command mode, and many keyboard shortcuts are available (In this mode, no icon is displayed in the indicator area).\" or similar. We want to tell people that the _absence_ of any icon there signals command mode. Also, the title should be \"Command mode\", not \"mode indicator\".\n- I'm getting edit mode deactivated when I page through the tour and go to the \"notice the border...\" part. No idea why, but it's confusing, because I'm getting switched out to command mode.  It was in edit mode in the part before, but when I click 'next', it reads \"notice that the border...\", but it switches out to command mode, so there's nothing to notice. Confusing...\n- The tour dies after the part talking about command mode. It highlights the word 'help' in the menu, and then nothing. Furthermore, after it dies, I can't seem to restart it anymore. Selecting it again from the menu does nothing. The only fix is to do a full page reload.\n"
