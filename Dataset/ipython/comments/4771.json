    "body": "gevent monkeypatching does all kinds of invasive things, and it really doesn't like to do the monkeypatching in the middle of a program, when there are already true threads and eventloops running in ways that are not compatible with gevent. I'm not sure there's anything for IPython to do, here.  gevent monkeypatch should be done before IPython starts its eventloop, and probably even before IPython imports anything like the threading module. I think that means you need to start IPython specially, after already invoking gevent patches.\n"
