They are probably a minority, and I don't think it is worth giving more info. If you give too much info or one-liner on how to do something then people don't learn. Using the word \"set\" implicitly state that you have to configure something, so you look for configuration. Once you know our configuration system then you know how to configure everything else. So it is small difficulty for the user, but he will gain a lot by surpassing it, it will also remove us the pain of describing on every configuration option in all the doc how to configure. \n\nAs for `%config`, not everything can be changed at load time with `%config` , so it can confuse user. \n\nStill it is true that the config docs might be a little too much for a new user and we should probably have a simple introduction doc just about config files and how to write them.\n"
