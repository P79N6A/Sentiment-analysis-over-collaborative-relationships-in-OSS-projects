    "body": "Maybe #10005 is relevant? I found that when a file is `%run`, we remove `__name__` from its namespace afterwards (not entirely sure why, but reluctant to change that code). Functions defined in that file keep a reference to its global namespace; in that case it broke `embed()`, but maybe it could also affect autoreload."
