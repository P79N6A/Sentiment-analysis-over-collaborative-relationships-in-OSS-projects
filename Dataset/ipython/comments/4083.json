I'm mainly wondering if that's ever going to be an issue.\n\n> we could end up inadvertently hiding things that should be displayed.\n\nThe only case that can effect is an object in hidden_ns is deleted, and then a new object is created interactively with the same name and at the same address and in the hidden_ns.  That seems sufficiently unlikely to be ignored.\n"
