    "body": "We discussed that  already in person I dont' remember all the details, but propagating the change of the on-disk file is problematic in a few ways. 1) you have to watch the files regularly. 2) lots of logics are not triggered/deactivated when the file is RO (autosave is one of them). 3) if we support making file writable again, then we need to support setting the file a RO while the notebook is loaded.\n\nChecking only at save, also mean we dont' get early warning as current UI does. \n\nSo maybe we should make it more visible when you start modifying things, that the notebook is RO. \n"

The problem is that people intuitively assume that the read-only state is reversible and start editing anyway. \n\nI think the ideal solution would be to keep the existing implementation, but also re-check permissions on any manual attempt to save (clicking the save button or hitting ctrl-s). Another good alternative would be to offer a Save As functionality, so users would have a chance to save their work and manually overwrite the locked file later.\n"

Make sure your notebook file on disk is writeable.\r\n2. Open the debugger for your browser.\r\n3. Search for: `Notebook.prototype.save_notebook`\r\n4. Set a breakpoint just inside that function.\r\n5. Click the save icon. (The debugger will halt at your breakpoint.)\r\n6. Enter the javascript console.\r\n7. Execute this code: `this.writable = true`\r\n8. Resume execution of the debugger.\r\n\r\nIt saved my file! For once I didn't lose content!\r\n\r\nThis is an ugly hack, but its better than the alternative."
