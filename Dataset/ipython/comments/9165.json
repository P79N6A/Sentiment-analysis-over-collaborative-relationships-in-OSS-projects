Also for noticing, the folder that I access with the Debian is a shared folder. The read/write speed there is slower. \n\nI also could only reproduce the error with Iceweasle. In Chrome (OS X) and Safari the webpage just needed a bit to load, but under Iceweasle it showed me an Server Error (At this moment I could only kill it the hard way). Even accessing one of the folders in Chrome/Safari still allowed me to close iPython the normal way.\n\n<img width=\"800\" alt=\"error\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14364148/12588691/e10ec6e4-c427-11e5-9c97-3ead19f4ce0f.png\">\n[error.txt](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/files/105360/error.txt)\n"

    "body": "Shared folders in VMs are certainly slower, but I'm still mystified as to why it's happening when you're only browsing the parent directory of the ones with many files. Is it actually specific to when the subdirs have many files, or does it affect anything shared directory? If you start `ipython` in there and do `os.listdir('.')`, is it quick?\n\n@minrk @Carreau am I missing something about how the notebook server scans files?\n"
