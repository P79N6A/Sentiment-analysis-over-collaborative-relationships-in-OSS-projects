Non-gtk backends work OK, but the gtk one remains borked, and if nobody submits a pull request with a good fix for it, I'll need some time to work on restoring the functionality myself.\n\nSo likely 3 weeks at best, I'm afraid.  Lack of manpower sucks...\n\nThe best way to help would be for someone to provide a pull request against 0.10.2 that fully fixes this, and then I could quickly cut a release.\n"

    "body": "The original issue was created by a portion of commit 3e84e9f446b752aef4c798b3a086084b5cdcb679 which I'll refer to as \"problematic commit\".\n\nMy fix185 branch originally undid a portion of the problematic commit, and the outstanding issue relates to other portions of that same commit.\n\nWhat isn't clear to me is the purpose of the function check_gtk inside Shell.py, which was added in the problematic commit. For some reason, it unconditionally returns mode 'tkthread' if gtk was safely imported and hasattr 'set_interactive', regardless of what mode was passed to it. This \"functionality\" is not used with the -pylab flag, which is why original one line change did not fix the issue for \"ipython -gthread\"\n\nI added another commit to the fix185 branch which removes check_gtk() altogether, and see no issues using ipython -gthread, ipython -gthread -pylab, or ipython -pylab. Additionally, the check_gtk() imported gtk regardless of what mode the user selected, and might also be what's been causing the \"Why is IPython using X11\" threads on the mailing list.\n\nalso, I just want to note here that users will see this issue if they use e.g \"ipython -gthread\" but their matplotlib is set to some other backend by default (say \"WX\").\n\nI opened pull request #237 to get this into 0.10.2 branch\n"
