    "body": "Let me make sure I understand you correctly: you want each user to be able to run their own notebook server, but to use their UNIX username and password to authenticate to the notebook.  Is this a fair statement?  That would very much fit into the model are are moving towards and we would be interested in supporting this type of authentication.  Here are some thoughts on this:\n\nWe should create an authentication object that inherits from IPython's Configurable class.  It should define a pretty generic auth interface that we can implement different subclasse for.  For your case, simple PAM based auth would probably work fine.  The username should be choosen to match the user that starts the notebook.  It won't be much code.\n\nThen in the main notebook app, we would need to define a configurable attribute that allows selection of which auth class to use.\n\nYou could then provide you users with a simple ipython_notebook_config.py file that sets the right options.\n\nHow does this sound?\n"

We will\nget there, but for now we want to foces purely on the single user case\nwhere the notion of a username is not present.  The problem with adding the\nusername to the actual UI, is that users will being to think that if they\nenter a different username they will see different notebooks, when in\nreality, that server only knows about _one_ set of notebooks.\n\nOh crap, this won't work at all....to talk to your authentication service,\nthe notebook will have to run as root not a regular user.  Once you enter\nthat land, you have to deal with many of the complications of the full\nmultiuser notebook.  There are a lot of non-trivial things to think about.\n We have funding to do this work, but the multiuser work won't start until\nabout 1 year from now, and we really need to remain focused on other work\nuntil then.\n\nBecause of this complication, I would write look at writing a helper script\nfor you users that would create the notebook configuration file, set the\npassword, etc.  As a sysadmin, you could even write a cron job that creates\nthat config file for each user and makes sure the password field is in sync\nwith its LDAP hosted value.\n\nOne other question - do you need your notebook kernels ro run under the\nuser's regular UNIX accounts, in their home directory?  You just want to\nfind a convenient way of managing their passwords?  Are all of the\nnotebooks going to be run on a single host?\n\nOn Thu, Jan 10, 2013 at 4:19 PM, shreddd notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Hi Brian - that is pretty close to what I was thinking.
