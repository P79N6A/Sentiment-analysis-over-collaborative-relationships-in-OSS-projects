    "body": "If it's from `_get_terminal_size`, then it's a bug from or dependencies, so it will need to be reported [here](https://github.com/chrippa/backports.shutil_get_terminal_size). Though the maintainer seem to have stopped releasing, so I would first try to install said package from master (see if it is fixed). And if necessary we can try to poke the maintainer, and if no response ask the PyPI folks in order to take over the package and publish an update. \r\n\r\nWhat's the raw excpetion returned by _get_terminal_size (if you don't use PDB) we can catch it and return a dummy value (like 80x40) as a workaround. \r\n\r\n"

The problem at the moment, and I'm stepping through the code to figure it out, is %recall returns nothing.  The previous command is not put onto a next input line."
