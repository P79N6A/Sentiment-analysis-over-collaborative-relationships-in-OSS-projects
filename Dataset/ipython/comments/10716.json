    "body": "With #10739, this doesn't need anything from any other packages.\r\n\r\nWe could also do this without defining `_repr_gif_` or `GIFFormatter` by using `_repr_mimebundle_`. Part of the point of adding that was eliminating the need to continue defining new formatters and magic methods when we support new mime-types. I would slightly prefer if GIFs were implemented that way, without the new class and magic method."
