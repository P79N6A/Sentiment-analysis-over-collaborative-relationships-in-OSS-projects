The idea being that we populate that file with content as we go, and then just massage and reorganize it for the release, instead of having to start essentially from nothing just before a release. In 0c81259cc9f1abf026ce142c9b9662e9e33a3810, Min took what was then in our `development.txt` file, and created the first version of what became [version1.0.rst](docs/source/whatsnew/version1.0.rst) - he had to do way too much right before the release...\n"
