    "body": "I think I have found the issue. It appears my code could not work by construction.\n\nI stumbled upon this on [nbviewer.ipthon.org](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/2.x/examples/Interactive%20Widgets/Widget%20Basics.ipynb):\n\"It's important to realize that widgets are not the same as output, even though they are displayed with display. Widgets are drawn in a special widget area. That area is marked with a close button which allows you to collapse the widgets. Widgets cannot be interleaved with output. Doing so would break the ability to make simple animations using clear_output.\"\n\nIf I put the call of the manipulate_plot method and the plt.show() into different python cells, all works well.\n\nI've got a working setup now, but I find it still a little awkward that output (figure)\n and controls of the output (widgets) are separate instead directly of next to each other.\n\nI'm thinking if it is possible to put the figure as a fixed element inside a container widget, or something?\nAny other ideas ?\n"
