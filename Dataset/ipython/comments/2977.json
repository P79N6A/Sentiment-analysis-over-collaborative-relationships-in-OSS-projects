    "body": "@robyoung hi, multidirectory support is something that is on our list of things we would like to get to before our 1.0 release in July:\n\nhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Roadmap:-IPython\n\nBut it is going to take some very careful thinking and design.  I haven't looked at your code, but for big things like this, it is often useful to start with discussion on the mailing list.  On our roadmap, this feature is currently lower priority than a lot of other things.  What this means is that we probably won't look at this until our higher priority tasks are done - it could be a few months or possibly not even at all for this release.  Our current thinking is that while we want to support notebooks in multiple directories, we want to avoid at all costs creating hierarchical file explorer.  We have some ideas about how to do this, but it is going to take some time to work out the details.\n"
