    "body": "The baseline for traitlets is matching traits behavior. If you set a Tuple traitlet with a list, it casts it to a tuple (the assignment succeeds, but the result is still a tuple), so there is no reason to add CTuple here. The reference for how CFoo traits work is they _always_ cast, which would mean that you can do `c.a = \"hi\"`, which would result in `('h', 'i')`. Those should be avoided when unnecessary, because they can be too permissive.\n"
