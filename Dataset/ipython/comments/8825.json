    "body": "It would appear that loading an empty rc file resets everything to default, which includes setting `interactive=False`. I think this is what's causing the plots to not show anymore. If you do `plt.show()`, it should draw your plot inline (with default mpl style). Similarly, if you call `matplotlib.interactive(True)`, it should start drawing the plots automatically again.\n\nI'm not sure that loading an rc file is meant to reset interactive, but it does seem to do that (@tacaswell?).\n"
