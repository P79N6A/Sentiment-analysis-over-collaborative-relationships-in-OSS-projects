Part of the difficulty is that we want it on for all but a couple of magics (the ones that take Python code, like %timeit), so it seems awkward to have a separate call in all the magics that do want it.\n"

You can see the undesirable transform it's making with `!echo`:\n\n``` python\nIn [5]: !echo \"timeit {'i', 'f'} <= set('buifc')\"\ntimeit ('i', 'f') <= set('buifc')\n```\n\nWe really shouldn't be making these variable expansions for magics that aren't calling out to the shell, but right now the decision is just made in the wrong place in the code to be able to say \"Don't do that for timeit\", even though it's always the wrong thing to do for things like timeit.\n"
