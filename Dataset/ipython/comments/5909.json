If you consider that behavior to be a bug, please report it to matplotlib.\n"

    "body": "This is because `AxesImage` (the class underlying `imshow`) is trying not to clobber your memory and holds onto a reference to your data array, rather than copying it.  The mapping from data -> rgba happens as late as possible (because matplotlib is lazy and this is a good thing) which is why you see this behavior.\n\nIf you want this to work use `plt.imshow(np.array(img))` which will make a copy to pass to `imshow`.\n"
