    "body": "Note that bpython uses curses to talk to the terminal as a 2D screen, whereas IPython uses the much simpler readline. Adding a bpython feature like its completions means completely rewriting the IPython terminal code.  The real request here is probably for a bpython _frontend_ to the IPython kernel, which is already described in #3339, so closing this as a duplicate.\n"
