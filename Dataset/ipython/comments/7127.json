    "body": "> I've fixed the -v thing. It is a wiki, if there are obvious problems like that, feel free to fix them yourself. \n\nGreat, I did not realize it was a wiki, thought it was markdown in the main source.  As for the test_pr.py thing, I don't really have a dog in that fight, and I just thought someone might like to know.  All I can say is I guess I might use it if it worked.. I'm always nervous my testing invocation will differ in some significant way from whatever travis uses and it's just inelegant to waste travis build time/cycles.\n\n> I can imagine it may be useful for extension authors to use parts of our testing machinery, like IPython.testing.globalipapp. I imagine they would do this from a Python API inside their tests, rather than actually calling iptest. Do you have an extension you'd like to create more tests for?\n\nI am the author of [smash](http://mattvonrocketstein.github.io/smash/) which does involve several extensions, but also digs really deep into the guts of ipython (trying hard to avoid a fork).  Just for instance see some of my [patches](https://github.com/mattvonrocketstein/smash/blob/master/smashlib/patches/edit.py) and [core overrides](https://github.com/mattvonrocketstein/smash/blob/master/smashlib/overrides.py).  Note that while I'm twisting up the ipython core with extra features, I also want to ensure total backwards compatibility.\n\nSo I'm struggling with a good approach for general testing, and hoped to improve documentation for posterity while I was learning my way around.  It seems to me that vanilla unit tests (by which I mean tests that do NOT use `_ip` or `get_ipython()`) will not work for me in the long term.  I've been looking over `globalipapp` a little, but I thought that perhaps using that would involve `iptest` anyway to setup other aspects of a bigger testing harness.  Any advice/thoughts would be much appreciated.  The point of opening this ticket is that I planned to return the favor with fresh docs on the wiki and/or docs pull requests :)\n"
