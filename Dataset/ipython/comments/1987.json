For this reason, the install goes there as well (essentially you have two IPython installs when you run from the source dir, and one otherwise).  The same would be true of all Python packages.\n"

Checked that error message comes. Executed mathjax install in different folder from IPython source, confirmed that it ends up in ~/Library/[...]/static and confirmed that error message is gone.\nThanks for your patience.\n"
