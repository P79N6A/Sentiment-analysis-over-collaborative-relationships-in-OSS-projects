    "body": "Hi @obiii  - It sounds like you're running into just a feature of docker, and not specific to the notebook  - docker runs exactly the image you specify, so all files, including the config file, return to their original state every time you restart the container. Perhaps you need to run something like `docker commit` to persist your changes. Another option might be to mount a directory with your custom config.\r\n\r\nIf you used https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/notebook/ - you should know that it was deprecated in favor of one of the `*-notebook`  versions in [jupyter/docker-stacks](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks).  If you want to propose changes to those stacks, [you can open an issue there](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/issues), but I am going to go ahead and close this one.\r\n\r\nThank you and happy hacking! :bowtie:"
