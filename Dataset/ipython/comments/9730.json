    "body": "Wow, our startup times have really become gigantic...  I had a vague sense they were creeping up, but with systems getting faster and SSDs, it still felt OK.  But now the ratio with the Python startup time is pretty awful:\n\n```\nKerbin[profile_default]> time ip -c \"'None'\"\n\nreal    0m1.175s\nuser    0m0.890s\nsys 0m0.068s\nKerbin[profile_default]> time python -c None\n\nreal    0m0.035s\nuser    0m0.025s\nsys 0m0.008s\n```\n\nBut that aside, I wouldn't bother with this, making  our exception handling logic more complicated for a truly odd corner case.  Besides, even if you trigger the base exception handler before ours is in place, the TB isn't that tiny: our stack is just big, period... So I don't see the cost/benefit ratio here making it worthwhile...\n\nLet's close this as-is, at least it documents the issue, and thanks @anntzer for reporting!\n"
