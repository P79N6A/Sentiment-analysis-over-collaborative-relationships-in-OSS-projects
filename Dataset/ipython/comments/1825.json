    "body": "So i think this is a really good start.  I have tested on both Chrome+FF and it behaves reasonably well.  Some observations:\n- Right now, clicking and double clicking inside cells is really awkward because of how we force-focus the code mirror cell each click.  I am running into this same issue as I play with interactive JS widgets.  It is really a separate issue, but we need to get rid of this force-focus behavior so that mouse click actions in output areas behave more sensibly.\n- I have mixed feelings about a fixed max-height value.  What about also making the output div resizable?\n- I observe very wacky things when I run the following in a cell in Chrome (FF is OK).\n\n``` python\nfor i in range(200):\n    print 200*'x'\n```\n\nMake your window narrow so you see horizontal scroll bars as well.  Then double-click to expand and things go crazy.\n"

When it expands in Chrome, I see no difference from the output in master, other than the fact that the cell is highlighted, which looks a bit funny, but is no different than if you highlight the same cell on master.\n\nIt seems impossible to have one dimension of overflow be scrolling and the other be visible at the same time, so the choices seem to be: \n\ntruncated:\n    scroll-y and hidden-x\n    scroll-y and scroll-x\n    hidden-x,y\nexpanded:\n    visible-y, \n        scroll-x\n        visible-x\n        hidden-x\n"

I've been playing with making it resizable instead of static, as Brian suggested, but I'm about to give up on that, as it seems to make everything worse.\n\nAssuming the scrolled size is static, whereabouts do we want to draw the line?  I have it currently at ~30 lines, so only quite long output will get scrolled, but I have no trouble with making it smaller or longer.  A smaller size makes the scrolling itself a bit less annoying, but makes it come up a lot more often (net more annoying, I expect).\n"

    "body": "I'm just about to push a fix that plays fairly nicely with FF.  It's specifically max-height that it just totally doesn't understand, but with the current logic I can just use height instead of max-height, because the CSS only applies when output is larger than that.  This wasn't true at the earlier part in the process.\n\n> - Fully hidden.\n> - Shown, but shortened/scrolling.\n> - Fully shown.\n\nI agree 99%.  I might add that  if you toggle output, it should remember whether it's scrolled up or not.  If it were stored in a single three-way variable, then collapsing would forget whether it is scrolled up or not.\n\nWhat do we want for menu items:\n\nWe currently have:\n- toggle current cell output (collapse/expand, orthogonal to scroll)\n\nBut might also have some subset of:\n- collapse all outputs | this output\n- expand all outputs | this output\n- scroll all long outputs | this output\n\nOf course, all of these are easy, but I imagine we probably don't want all of them.\n\nAlso, we currently store 'collapsed' in the notebook format. Do we want to do this for the scrolled state as well?  I would think not.\n"

    "body": "> I think the first step should be to figure out what the mouse driven UI is like for switching between output views. Then we should come up with a good keyboard shortcut to cover the switching.\n\nRight now, it's double-click to toggle between scrolled/full-expand.  There is no mouse UI for hiding the output besides the menu entry, and I'm not sure there's a need for one.\n\nGiven states:\n\nC - collapsed\nS - scrolled\nE - expanded\n\nI only see a reason for the following events, in either mouse or keyboard UI:\n- (S|E) <=> C (currently ^M-o, Menu entry)\n  and\n- S <=> E (currently double-click only)\n\nThere aren't many sensible keyboard shortcuts left (S,C,O,L are all taken), so I am not sure it's worth taking up an extra one for toggling the scroll.\n\nI'm not sure a three-way switch makes sense, but maybe the current ^M-o shortcut should cycle through collapse/scroll/expand.\n\nAs for the menu entries, I think it might make sense to have the three \"apply state X to all cells\" options, possibly keeping the existing toggle current or not.\n\nI think W,E,R shortcuts are all available, so they could be collapse (like close which is ^W), Expanded, and scRoll?\n\n> In terms of the notebook format, do you think it makes sense to even save collapsed at all?\n\nIt seems a little bit odd to me, but the use case that comes to mind is a demo/teaching notebook where you don't want all your outputs to be visible on load, but you still want them stored in the notebook.\n"

    "body": "Functionally, I think this is really starting to work well.  A few comments:\n- I think we definitely need a simple mouse driven UI that switches between all 3 states.  I think that a dblclick based switch makes sense, but we need to add the hidden output state to the UI.  Part of the problem with the current hide output  state is that it doesn't provide any indication that there is hidden input for that cell.  When the output is hidden, we should probably insert/show a div to indicate the hidden output and which a user can dblclick on to unhide things.\n- I don't think the current gradient on the top+bottom border of the scrolling area works.  It could be that the shadow is not gradual enough so it looks like a thicker broder.  I think the lack of a shadow on the R/L is also an issue, as is the lack of a symmetric space on the L side between the output area and the cell's border.  We will probably just have to play around with this.\n"

And maybe trying a lighter end color.  I will also try a 1px solid border on the sides, because I doubt a horizontal gradient will look nice.\n\n> ---\n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1825#issuecomment-6194791\n"

The reason is that in the future there will be JavaScript widgets in that div that can register its own arbitrary event handlers.

For instance, dblclick here would conflict with dblclick mentioned in #1887. The only option I see is to restrict our click actions to the prompt area on the left.  I tried this at some point, but since there are actually N prompt divs rather than one, it was a bit funky, and I gave up.  I can try floating a single div overlay on the whole prompt area again, and that would then be the active area for scroll/hide, rather than the whole div.\n> > \n> > If we do focus on the prompt area, I could have, for instance, _buttons_ that only appear on hover on the prompt area.
