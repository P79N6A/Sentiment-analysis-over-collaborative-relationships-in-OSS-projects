I just figured we should do our best, for now, to keep the console/readline ipython working in pypy.\n\nLater, as they make more progress on extension support, we'll see about the pieces that need zmq, but all that worries me much less.\n\nWe've always said there is a 'core' part of ipython that runs with only the stdlib.  That's the part I want to try to keep pypy-friendly.\n"
