    "body": "Well, I think this helps to simplify things a lot because:\n1. These functions already return None when Matplotlib or Latex can't be found. So instead of checking only for that case in qtconsole, we would also need to catch errors there.\n2. Possible sources of errors are:\n   1. Matplotlib is unable to handle complex Latex. However, that's no easily discernible when reporting that error to users, so I don't see much of a point in doing that.\n   2. There's a syntax error in Latex. That will generate one of those huge Latex report errors, but again I don't see much of a value reporting that error. I think people would assume that if no representation is generated, that's because there's an error in their Latex.\n3. Sympy uses these functions independently to generate latex-png representations for their objects. This was generating a traceback in qtconsole even after jupyter/qtconsole#65 because the error had to be catched in Sympy besides doing it in qtconsole. If other projects also do the same, then all of them would need to catch errors generated by `latex_to_foo` and jupyter/qtconsole#65 is kind of pointless. This PR simply address that possibility, preventing at the same time to show ugly tracebacks in qtconsole.\n"
