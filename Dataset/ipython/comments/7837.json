    "body": "> Because IPython/Jupyter is written in Python, I don't see this as a problem.\n\nWell, the part that nbextensions are relevant to is written in Javascript. Maybe we should be integrating with bower... :trollface: \n\nMore seriously, Python packaging is horrible enough just trying to do the things it is supposed to do. I suspect that trying to hammer it into doing all the things we want it to do will be even worse than:\n\n> Alternatively we could write our own package manager.\n\nthis.\n\nE.g. Someone filed a bug against bash_kernel the other day saying that when you did `pip uninstall bash_kernel`, the kernelspec wasn't uninstalled. Of course it wasn't, the fact that it gets installed at all is a complete hack. Working with uninstall would be an order of magnitude more complex. And we're bound to get bug reports from people who expect to be able to make wheels, where it won't work, and... I just hate the thought of maintaining something like this.\n\nI suspect we will have to write our own package manager at some point. We certainly need to sit down and think about different cases for nbextensions and how distribution should work. But this, to me, has all the hallmarks of a neat-looking halfway solution that people will use because it saves typing, but will lead to other problems and confusion.\n\nIf you must do this, please make it a separate package, not part of the IPython API.\n\n> It would be nice if I could look at the call stack to see what the last module was\n\nYou can, but please don't. Code that looks back up the call stack to see what called it is horrendous to debug. Explicit is better than implicit.\n\n(Milestoned 4.0 because this is very much a new feature, so even if it goes in, I don't think it belongs in a bugfix release)\n"
