    "body": "Strangely it only dies in the remote computer. In the computer where the kernel is running nothing happens...the kernel does not die, does not restart, no error messages...nothing. Moreover, although it say the kernel died and restarted, it does not loose any information. I.e., any variable, etc. that has been defined remains after the kernel died. So I guess it must be something about the connection, but not sure what.\r\n\r\nI think it is related only to the ``jupyter qtconsole``, since I am able to use the ``notebook`` remotely without crashes. Not sure how to test ``jupyter console`` remotely. I mean I can ``ssh`` to the other machine and run ``jupyter console``, there is no issue there, but it is not a remote connection in the same way as the ``qtconsole`` or the ``notebook``."
