    "body": "Can you show a complete example of storing something and attempting to restore it that doesn't work?\n\n`%store` uses pickle. The advantage of that is that it can store almost anything you can represent in Python. The downside is that pickle can change between versions of Python (newer ones should be able to read data from older, but not vice versa, and there are complexities with strings between Python 2 and 3). Also, pickle can rely on importable modules: if you pickle an instance of a class, it will try to re-import that class when you unpickle it. If the class isn't importable, it will fail.\n"
