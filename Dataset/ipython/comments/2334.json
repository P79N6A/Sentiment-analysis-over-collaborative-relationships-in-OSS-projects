Thanks a lot!\n\nThis feature is really important to me, because I need to restart the controller from time to time while several engines are connected. Each engine runs in a wrapper script which restarts the engine process automatically. So all engines should be back soon, once the controller is available again.\n"

    "body": "@kaazoo - you know, the controller is resumable now, so you can actually restart the controller without restarting the engines:\n\n``` bash\n# start controller with 'reuse-files' enabled\n$> ipcontroller --reuse\n# start a few engines with ipengine\n# kill the controller\n# now try to restore the controller to its previous state:\n$> ipcontroller --restore\n```\n\nThis is experimental, and may not be reliable yet, but it has worked in .  Of course, that means that this heartbeat-checking behavior must also be able to be disabled.\n\nMy only qualm about this PR at the moment is that there are now two closely related but not mechanically connected configurables (engine hb_check_period and HeartMonitor.period).  I wonder if it would be preferable to associate the two by having the registration_reply on the hub reply with the HM.period, so that the only configurable on the engine is the number of acceptable missed beats.  The reason being that a common debug action when engines are misbehaving is to set the HeartMonitor.period to something quite large (e.g 30-60 seconds).  Users who do this would then have to set two variables every time they want to do this.  What do you think about that, @JanSchulz?\n"

    "body": "@JanSchulz - just about, thanks!\n\nI don't think there needs to be more than one (or maybe two) configurables on the engine side:\n1. The only configurable we need seems to be `max_heartbeat_misses`, an integer for the number of HeartMonitor.periods for the interval we check.  When this is zero, checking is disabled.  That would seem to cover things pretty well.\n2. I wouldn't object to a separate `exit_on_missed_heartbeats` boolean flag, if explicit disable is preferable, but my leaning is ever-so-slightly towards a single configurable, but you are the author here, so I will defer to you on that.\n"
