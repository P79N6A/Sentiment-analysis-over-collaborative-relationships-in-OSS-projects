    "body": "I wouldn't worry too much about backwards compatibility. The only reason to run `jupyter notebook foo.ipynb` is to open that notebook in a browser, so it's probably not written into scripts much. I'd just make that check for an existing server and use it if available. We could have a `--new-server` flag or something to force it to start a new server. This is already how many programs (e.g. browsers) work.\n\nHaving some kind of management interface probably makes sense (see also nbmanager), but it's more than just start/stop/restart, because there can be multiple servers running.\n"
