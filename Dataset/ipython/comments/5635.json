    "body": "Moving my comments over from the other discussion:\n\nGFM works for Marked -> HMTL, but to enable it for Pandoc you'd need to use `markdown_github` instead of `markdown` here (and also in your markdown2latex function): https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/nbconvert/filters/markdown.py#L87\n\n```\n    return pandoc(source, 'markdown', 'html', extra_args=['--mathjax'])\n```\n\nIf you're supporting GFM in Marked.js, it would be a good idea to turn it on in pandoc as well to minimize inconsistencies in translations. Note this relies on pandoc >= 1.11\n"

    "body": "Just to join in here: current pandoc (<=1.13.2) does have a problem with tables (from html to something else), where you have `th` in a normal row. The result is that the output from such a table is simple each cell in plain text/one paragraph. Bugreport is [here](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/issues/1859) and should be fixed in the next release (>=1.13.3) . Another issue is indention: if you have 4 spaces at the front of the row this is interpreted as a `pre`-block :-(\n\nUnfortunately pandas does both :-(\n\nIn  Knitpy I worked around the first issue by replacing all `th` in a `tr` with `td` (see [here](https://github.com/JanSchulz/knitpy/blob/master/knitpy/documents.py#L342) -> it's the same strategy which the to-be-release pandoc will take) and removing all double-and-more spaces in html.\n"
