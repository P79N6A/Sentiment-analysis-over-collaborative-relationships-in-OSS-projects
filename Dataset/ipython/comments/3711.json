I'm going through and closing old issues where it makes sense, and I think it makes sense to close this one. \n\n[JupyterLab](/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) moved a model where help output is displayed inline, with the additional functionality that outputs can be dragged out to their own vertical or horizontal panel, which is similar to the functionality you were seeking.\n\nHappy hacking! :bowtie: \n"
