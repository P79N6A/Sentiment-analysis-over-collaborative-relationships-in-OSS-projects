But if instead I do this:\n\n``` python\nfigure()\nscatter(r_[0,1,2], r_[0,1,2], marker='x')\n```\n\nthen saving with external PNG produces the error you indicate above.  Now, those two calls should be the same from our perspective, so I really don't get what's going on.  We'll have to dig in to figure this out, but obviously we can't release 0.12 with broken qt console export.\n\nThanks for the timely report!\n"

If the bug has been in the wild for 4 months, I don't want to hold the 0.12 release just for it.\n\nBut still, it is real and serious, so we should definitely try to address it ASAP.  With a bit of luck we'll have it fixed before the release, but since that's coming this weekend, it may not quite happen right away.\n"
