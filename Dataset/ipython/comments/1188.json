    "body": "This seems EPD-specific, because I can use the same IPython+matplotlib without EPD and they work fine.\n\nI also see the same weird behavior with the osx backend of matplotlib from a pure-Python terminal on EPD (again, does not affect system Python), so I would bring this up with the EPD or MPL lists, as it isn't IPython related.\n\nAre you using the EPD matplotlib, or your own, and if you built it yourself, did you build it with EPD or system Python?  I only see this when I'm using matplotlib that I built with system Python (current git master), but is still found by EPD because I installed it `--user`.\n"
