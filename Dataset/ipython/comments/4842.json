But we need to decide how to handle the initial state:\n- Leave as is - it won't appear until the kernel sends a status message.\n- Just guess as idle - wrong if reopening a notebook with a busy kernel.\n\nWe should also remember that we will be soon moving to a model where the kernel won't be running when a page is loaded always.
