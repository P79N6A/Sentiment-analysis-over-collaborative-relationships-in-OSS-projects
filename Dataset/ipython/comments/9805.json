Since version 1.0.0, prompt_toolkit has a custom Style implementation that is compatible with Pygments, and this one already supports that. So, as long as in IPython, we don't inherit from Pygments' Style class, but just use a plain style dictionary, we can actually use that.\nhttps://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/master/prompt_toolkit/styles/from_dict.py\nhttps://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/master/examples/colored-prompt.py\n"
