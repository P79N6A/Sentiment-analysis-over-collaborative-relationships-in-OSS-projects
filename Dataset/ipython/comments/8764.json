    "body": "Hi @Carreau \n\nThanks for your reply! I think your cookie might indeed be set, and the reason why mine doesn't is because my client is on a different domain. \n- after the response header is sent to the client(browser), the browser responds before any message is passed to the javascript, by instantaneously send out another `GET` request to the default or user-set `next` url. There is no way to intercept this response.\n- but this point is moot because since my client comes from a different domain, it is possible that this 302 response with the proper `Set-Cookie` header field is simply **not able** to set the cookie properly. So a proper solution to this require a token-based authentication module to be written.\n\nI looked at the code, and it seems there isn't really that much work that needs to be done, however I am not so sure about writing the tests T_T\n\n[#325 PAM plug in and documentation](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/325) \n"
