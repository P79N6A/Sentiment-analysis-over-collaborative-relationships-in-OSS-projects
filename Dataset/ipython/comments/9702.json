    "body": "I haven't worked with this code recently and I don't know why we have a regression, but as a general rule, threads at the heart of our event loop system have been historically nothing but a source of pain. A long time ago, we were able to move away from threads (the original solution for GUI integration dating back to ~2003/4), and that was a _huge_ gain in stability.\n\nWe should really think long and hard about how to figure out a non-thread solution.\n\nFor reference, this is an attempt to fix #9652.\n"
