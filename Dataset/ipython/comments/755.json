It is available for use in applications which incorporate a qtconsole. \n2. Commits 3ccb8ee and 03159d0 resolved all but an extreme edge case (a filename containing both single and double quotes). \n3. PR #1122 should resolve that final case. Not sure why I was hesitant to make this change originally.\n"
