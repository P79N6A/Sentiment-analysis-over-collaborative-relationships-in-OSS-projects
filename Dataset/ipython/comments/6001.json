    "body": "I don't understand. The notebook server is one process that listens on a single port for both HTTP and WebSocket traffic. The reason we got rid of the configurability is that if you set the WebSocket port to something different than the HTTP port in the JavaScript frontend, you have to write a entirely custom notebook server that runs these services on different ports - something that our server has never done. I don't see how any proxy magic can change that unless you are also customizing the server itself in a non-trivial way. Can you clarify?\n"
