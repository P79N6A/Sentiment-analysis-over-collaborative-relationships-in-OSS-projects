    "body": "Hi there !\n\nThanks a lot !\n\nI'm (a bit) worried of touching completion close to 5.0 beta (I don't expect you to know we are close to beta, that I hope to release in less than a week). We've played with [integrating jedi](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/9375) not so long ago, but had to [roll back](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/9476) recently because of many undesirable side effect. \n\nI would much better prefer delaying that a bit, and get a complete overhaul of the completion machinery for 6.0 (use Completions object instead of Strings, etc...) and match jedi API than trying to shoehorn a hack. \n\nAlso this refactoring should allow us to do smarter things like attaching metadata to completion (like their type) that would be shown in the UI.\n\nWhat do you think ?\n\n@takluyver your thoughts too.\n"

In particular, on Windows, the inability to autocomplete paths in another drive or after `Documents and Settings` is a real pain.\nSo even if this chunk of code was to be stripped out in 6.0 I'd still call it a gain for now.\n"

The patch seem relatively straightforward, so I'm going to re-study-it in more detail tomorrow, and likely give it a go if another core dev agree.\n\nI'm still wondering what the `text.lower()` part could be responsible for. \n"

Use it in IPython and make it public later. \n"
