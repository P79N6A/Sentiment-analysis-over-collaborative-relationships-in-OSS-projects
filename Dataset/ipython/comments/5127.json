    "body": "> I thought the design was that after 3 queued up messages or so, changes would be merged into a final queued message. It shouldn't be queuing up every change.\n\nYou're right, it does seem that only three updates occur after the end of the interaction (i.e. when I stop moving the slider). Here is the test script I used:\n\n``` python\nimport time\nfrom IPython.html import widgets\n@widgets.interact(x=(0, 255))\ndef f(x):\n    time.sleep(3)\n    print(x)\n```\n\nHowever, when the function takes a few seconds (or more) to complete, it does seem a bit weird to see three updates during the 10 seconds that follow the end of the interaction. Maybe this arbitrary number 3 should depend on the execution duration of the function? Or could there be a single update after the end of the interaction?\n"
