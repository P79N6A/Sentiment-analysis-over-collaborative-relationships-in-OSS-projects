    "body": "master _should_ check whether the dir is writable, and skip it if not.  But if it doesn't make sense for it to be the default, perhaps it should drop behind HOME.  I don't know much about Windows environments, but a quick skim of The Googles seems to suggest that HOMESHARE isn't ever right, and it should be %HOMESHARE%%HOMEPATH%, if we are using it.\n\nIf you want to set the IPython directory, you can always use the IPYTHON_DIR env variable.\n"
