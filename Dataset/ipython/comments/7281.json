    "body": "@dongweiming thank you for the PR.  The popup widget is an oddball in the built-in widget collection.  After talking to the others during the last dev meeting (or meeting before last, I forget which), we came to the conclusion that it is best to remove the popup widget altogether.  However, the underlying API that allows one to implement the popup widget will not be removed, see PR #7341 .  **If** we do include something like the popup widget again, it will be implemented from scratch, probably as a phosphor component (or something similar).\n"
