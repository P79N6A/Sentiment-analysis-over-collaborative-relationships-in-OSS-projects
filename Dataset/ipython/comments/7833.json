You still need part of the traceback to work out where the problem is. If you wanted to get smart, you could even recognise where it's recursing and elide the repeated frames.\n\nMarking this as 4.0, since it's presumably been a problem forever, it's not urgent to get it fixed.\n"

Something like lineprofiler maybe.\n\nIf that turns out to be unfeasible it should be possible to collapse the repeated frames and print an ellipsis instead. I'd probably get going on this first.\n"
