    "body": "The issue seems to be that the kernel's stderr pipe is closed, and we don't handle that. I think that's probably something we should handle, but it's not urgent. Since the kernels log to the parent stdout,stderr by default (this is not really avoidable), I think the solution for starcluster might be as simple as redirecting the server's stdout,err to files.\n\nFor a proper _fix_, we may want to enable redirecting kernel stdout/err, which we don't right now.\n"
