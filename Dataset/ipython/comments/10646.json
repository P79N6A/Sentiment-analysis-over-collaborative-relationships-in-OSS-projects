    "body": "sp.integrate is a submodule of SciPy, so you need to import it once for it\nto be available.\nThat's how python work so I'd be worried about changing the behavior.\nThe confusion is likely that many modules do implicitly import their\nsubmodules, which makes things like `import foo; foo.bar.func()` appear to\nbe correct, though it is likely not.
