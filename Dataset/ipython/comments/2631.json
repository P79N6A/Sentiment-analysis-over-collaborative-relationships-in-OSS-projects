    "body": "@Carreau:\nI think it makes sense to have two IPython Notebook shortcuts: without (default) and with \"--pylab inline\". I'll add it to the PR. Btw, is there a way to get inline pyplot graphs without loading the pylab namespace?\nThe icon displayed for the IPython shortcuts is the python.exe icon, which is good enough for me. Distinguishable IPython icons would be nicer though.\n\n@bfroehle:\nThe names appearing in the Windows start menu are the file names of the links. The current short names are not too descriptive.\nYes, there will be duplicate shortcut entries if folks \"upgrade\" by installing over an existing IPython package, without uninstalling the existing package first, which is bad practice.\n\nThere is still a minor issue specific to Windows 8, which does not have a \"start menu\" but a \"start screen\". While the start menu of Windows <=7 is hierarchical (there is a separate IPython folder for each Python version), the default start screen of Windows 8 is flat (I currently have 48 IPython entries). However, the start screen can be expanded to show headings (hidden \"All apps\" screen). A solution would be to include the Python version number and bitness in the IPython shortcut file names.\n"
