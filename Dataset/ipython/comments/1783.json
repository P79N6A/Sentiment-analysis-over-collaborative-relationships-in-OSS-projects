I had a ton of conflicts, and they ended up appearing in a very entangled and difficult to understand way, I had to go full-bore with meld open in 3-way merge  mode, _plus_ two emacs windows with the files for manual editing.  I was worried at some point I'd make a mistake like this...  Oh well, will be fixed now.\n"
