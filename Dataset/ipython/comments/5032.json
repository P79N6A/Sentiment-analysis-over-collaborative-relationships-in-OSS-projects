    "body": "Thanks for the links; that is useful and I am caught up on the discussion. \n\nBrian, Pawel's goal was very different from what I am attempting to do. I would just like to use parts of IPython, and Pawel was attempting (I think) to run all of IPython (frontend, ipython, and kernel) in IronPython. I agree that the goal of making all of IPython run in IronPython is outside the scope. But I think making IPython be able to be imported into IronPython could work with just a few changes---and changes that could make the IPython base more robust, load faster, etc. For example, I think a little refactor here and there would make it so that some things that aren't needed yet wouldn't be loaded until they are needed.\n\nThis would help make parts of IPython usable as a library, from another application.\n"

    "body": "> it treats unicode/strings differently that both Python 2 and 3.\n> @ellisonbg I would like to qualify the statement, it may lead to a confusion.\n\nThe unicode/strings system in IronPython 2.7 is exactly as unicode/string system of cpython 3.x\nThe stdlib return types and arguments are as cpython 2.7.\nThe situation is similar to jython and has been endorsed by the usual suspects.\n\nThe unicode/string system in IronPython 3.x (let's call it IronPython 2014 ;-) will be exactly as unicode/string system of cpython 3.x\nThe stdlib return types and arguments will be as in cpython 3.x.\n"

    "body": "I have an opinion how IronPython should fit into the existing cpython ecosystem. \nIronPython runs under windows using .net and mono and under unix using mono (I ignore phones and silverlight).\nWhen using .net IronPython attempts to act similarly to windows port of cpython. Some of the posix parts (e.g filedescriptor) are simulated, some are missing (signals).\nNow under unix, it makes to me little sense to act as windows cpython and rebuild/simulate posix stack when more or less reference implementation of such a stack is available.\nI believe, it would be better to make platform specific parts to depend on os and not try to pretend there is an universal cli world.\nIn this particular case, once IronPython gets to 3.x and don't have to deal with wired world of unicode/string/stdlib I would simply expect that IronPython under windows (.net and mono) would take win32 logic and under mono unix the unix one.\nOf course, this is an opinion/idea and I will have to prove my point with PR. Good candidate would be select.select which is downgraded under mono to Socket.select.\n"
