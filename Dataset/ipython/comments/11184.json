Dropping the 'var' resolves the whitespace error. \r\n\r\nI am seeing that the %env command requires the value to be unquoted, otherwise quotes are included in the value - so these two commands are equivalent: \r\n`%env GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=C:/Folder Name/gcp_creds.json`\r\n`os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = \"C:/Folder Name/gcp_creds.json\"`\r\n\r\nThe former doesn't match usual quoting behavior in Python, which tripped me up, and I could see that affecting others as well. Stripping enclosing quotes if present is an easy thing to do, but I'm not sure if there are existing use cases which would be broken by that - thoughts? "
