I actually _don't_ like that the tooltips in the qtconsole come up always.  I don't need to see the `range(` tooltip all the time, it's just an annoyance.  What I'd like to have instead is showing the tooltip if I hit tab, so that as I'm coding, if I think I need the call reference, I can just hit tab after `(`, and instead of attempting to complete a parenthesis (which makes no sense), tab does the useful thing and gives me the tooltip.\n\nDo you think that's doable, @Carreau?\n"

(my first implementation cc48f13 )\n- Pressing <tab> and the character just befor the cursor is `(`, (otherwise clasical completion) ( added in 20d764f )\n\nWe could try to improve when tooltip can be called, by playing with regular expression. I'm for now matching to something like `/[a-zA-Z_.]\\+\\(?$/` and also have hard coded a `if( pre_cursor.substr(-1) === '(' )`. \nWays of improving I see might be :\n- Fallback to tooltip if kernel response on completion is empty (too complicated I think)\n- Don't autocomplete if caracter before `cursor` is whitespace fallback on tooltip (My favorite choice)\n- Promote completion ending with `=` (kwarg completion) to the top of completer\n\nWe can think of a lot of other option, like keeping the tooltip open as long as the user hasn't press`)` or other, but i don't think the tooltip can really replace something like `foo?` without becoming over complicated for a not so obvious advantage as you most of the time don't use kwargs you don't know about...\n\nFor now, I'm refactoring the current completer, by adding an \"as you type\" filter,  I can try to \"merge\" it with the tooltip, with something which look like a completer but with the docstring and definition of the 'best match'\n"

    "body": "no problem. Issues are that both  completion's and tooltip's `div`s are positionned absolutly, so will overlap, and the completer's `select` take focus which will prevent the tooltip from beeing dissmissed when the completer give focus back to code mirror.\nIn the end it might be possible, but the code will be too complicated (at least I think so...). If we really want something that handle a little of completion and a little of tooltip the _resonable_ way is to create a uniq object which deal with all the logic of `completion_request/reply` and `object_info_request/reply`\n\nThat my opinion,but it's only my 3rd real day of implementing smth in JS which is not just opennig firebug and messing with live code in the debugger...\n\nBTW, do you have any idea of how I can make the all things configurable (time for tooltip and so on ) or to who I need to ask. I have looked at the documentation, but I dont find how to add a configurable for the `NotebookWebApp`, I did came across `c.NotebookApp.password` but I wasn't able to follow the track well enough to understand ...\n"

Great job, many thanks.\n\nSome feedback before we merge it (but rest assured, this is definitely going in, it's awesome :)\n- could you add a little 'close' button on the top-right of the tooltip so it can be closed with the mouse?\n- can the tooltip be made resizeable?  \n\nI think the ideal toolbar would be both resizeable _and_ with a scroll bar.  This way, people can leave it alone when reading, but could resize it if they need to see a little more, or scroll down to copy an example.\n"

I imagine you did this b/c they'd overlap with the text... \n\nSo here's a suggestion: for expand and pager, put them at the bottom in a separate div, so the tooltip box can stay as it was.  And the close one could go on the top-right, alone, and be an X in a square box instead of a full button.  There are lots of little 'x' icons on the net that can be used, here's one for example: ![close icon](http://i.imgur.com/Fwy1m.png) (could be made dark gray instead of blue to match the rest of our colors).\n1. Serious problem: I can trivially lock up the notebook by requesting the same tooltip twice.  Try this: \n\n```\nsome_function( <tab> <esc> <tab>\n```\n\nThe second tab doesn't produce a tooltip, and now the kernel won't accept any further input.\n\nI don't know if this is a kernel or frontend issue, but we need to sort it out before merging.\n"

I really don't understand why it would make the connexion crash, but i'll try to find a debian to test it. But true, it doen't work on FF, i'll investigate.\n\n```\n(could be made dark gray instead of blue to match the rest of our colors).\n```\n\nThey should be (like [that](http://elacave.lmdb.eu/~carreau/tooltip.png))... could you send me a screenshot ? \n\n```\nCould the buttons be put so that the tooltip doesn't need to be made so wide.\n```\n\nYes they are `floating-right`, no problem, but I choose the tooltip \"max-width\" so that the text of the doc would generally no be wraped and if it touch the right border of the screen it should shrink\n\n```\n[...] put them at the bottom in a separate div, so the tooltip box can stay as it was\n```\n\nThey will be in the css \"overflow area\" ant might not always be visible but i'll  try to find a way.\n"
