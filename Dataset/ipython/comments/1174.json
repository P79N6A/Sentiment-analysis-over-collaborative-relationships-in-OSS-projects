    "body": "Mmhh... I don't recall, but still, it's a good point.  The question is: when we added this, did we have any mechanism at all other than manual copying of files and directories? I think we didn't, so a magic seemed like a good solution.  Furthermore, I don't think our old system recognized profiles that were kept in the ipython directory, only those that had been made available to the user.  \n\nNow that users can specify with `--profile` a profile that they haven't installed locally, it seems to me that there is much less need to offer to install profiles in their personal area (if anything, there's less incentive, as by not installing their personal copies they benefit from updates we make to the shipped ones).\n"
