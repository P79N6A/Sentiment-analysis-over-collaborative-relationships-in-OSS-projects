And yes, a simple message explaining to use `%load_ext rmagic` to enable it will be fine.\n\nTarget the PR against master, and mention that it's a candidate for backporting to 1.x.\n\nThanks!\n"

    "body": "It turns out that sphinx is somewhat broken by graphviz,which switched to a stricter parser in 2.30. Its reported in the [sphinx issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/issue/1131/inheritance-diagram-graphviz-issue), but not quite recognized by the sphinx folks as a problem as far as I can see. The solution now is apparently to downgrade to 2.28. Or, perhaps there is a problem with our usage of sphinx. I'm a bit out of my league on tracking that down, though.\n\nI'm not opening this as an ipython issue, but if anyone thinks it should be, feel free. I'll also respond to queries about this issue here.\n"
