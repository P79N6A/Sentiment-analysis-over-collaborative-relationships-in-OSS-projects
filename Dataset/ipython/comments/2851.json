    "body": "### IPython 0.13.1\n\nOk, switching backends seems to work nicely if I don't use the `%pylab inline` magic (`from pylab import *` instead). If I want to switch to notebook's 'inline' mode, I use\n\n`switch_backend('module://IPython.zmq.pylab.backend_inline')`\n\nI can keep switching backends this way and drawing plots without problems.\n\nIf, however, I use the magic `%pylab inline` things start to get weird... A few examples: \n- I run `%pylab inline` _first_, draw a plot, then `switch_backend('Qt4Agg')` and draw another, the plot appears inline, and a 'Figure 1' popup appears but is grey for Qt4Agg (ubuntu's way of saying the process is busy) and quickly disappears for TkAgg. If I kill the popup and plot again with Qt4Agg (ie: without switching), the kernel dies.\n- I run `%pylab inline` _first_, then `switch_backend('Qt4Agg')` and plot something, the plot does not appear, and there is no error or other complaint - as if I were using the `Agg` backend, though `matplotlib.backends.backend` is 'Qt4Agg'. If at this point I `switch_backend('module://IPython.zmq.pylab.backend_inline')`, the grey 'Figure 1' appears (immediately on switching).\n\nI could come up with other combinations and strange behaviours if it's useful. I get the feeling that this may already have been reported in another issue?? Or perhaps would be better in an issue of it's own.\n\nHere's some versions of some perhaps relevant packages (all installed with pip):\nmatplotlib==1.2.0\nnumpy==1.7.0\nscipy==0.11.0\nipython==0.13.1\n\n### IPython HEAD version\n\nNow, in a virtualenv with everything the same (`mkvirtualenv ipython-dev-2 --system-site-packages`) I installed from the latest ipython source (commit 8051036691963ea7e24b9295d0d164ed6b7409e8). Here the above scenarios are a little different:\n- If I don't use `%pylab inline`, switching to `switch_backend('module://IPython.kernel.zmq.pylab.backend_inline')` does not produce any plots, but doesn't crash either. Othewise switching works as expected.\n- I run `%pylab inline` _first_, the behaviour is the same as 0.13.1\n\n(note: the backend_inline module has moved to `IPython.kernel.zmq.pylab.backend_inline`)\n"
