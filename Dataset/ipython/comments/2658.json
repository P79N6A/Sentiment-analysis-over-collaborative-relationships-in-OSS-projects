    "body": "Hi Ryan :)\n\nI can confirm that in IPython notebook, latest master (commit 6c36cd9332f1138bfe2910516b80f8a7c750ac40), I have the following input/output in the notebook:\n\n```\ntest = r'''%@article {Cat61,\n%    AUTHOR = {Cattabriga, Lamberto},\n'''\n```\n\nThen test is `\"%@article {Cat61,\\nget_ipython().magic(u'AUTHOR = {Cattabriga, Lamberto},')\\n\"` (note the magic call...)\n\nIf input is:\n\n```\ntest = r'''%test,\n%test2\n'''\n```\n\nthen test is `\"%test,\\nget_ipython().magic(u'test2')\\n\"`\n\nI think this issue is probably related to gh-2628, and is probably a result of the code at https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/inputsplitter.py#L908 (just like gh-2628 is triggered by an omission at that line, as you can see from gh-2428).\n"
