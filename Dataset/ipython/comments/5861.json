    "body": "As @jakevdp said, we're encouraging people to move away from using pylab mode for reasons like this. In IPython 3, starting the notebook server with `--pylab` won't work, though you'll still be able to start plain terminal IPython like that, because it is handy at times.\n\nI don't think we can change this within pylab mode, because it would break things for people who are used to `all` and `any` being the numpy variants.\n"
