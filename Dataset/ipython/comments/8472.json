I think of it as a team wiki.\n\nI do expect IPYTHONDIR to be writable.  The host is a virtual machine that will likely see light traffic.  Some projects involve a lot of javascript, so I thought ijavascript would be nice to have.  Same with redis.  I want to learn Haskell, so ihaskell seems very attractive.  \n\nOne of the reasons I do not want things in /root/ is that some of the other kernels might not be stable.  Example, the redis kernel did not work for me.  Until it does, I do not want it visible on the notebook server web page.\n"
