    "body": "Looking at the code, output data is written separately. It's not easy to get unicode output in Python 2.x (assuming we're limited to `repr`s produced by the interpreter, not print statements), but it is possible: define a class, replace its `__name__` with a unicode character, and ask for it. So we should probably encode odata too, just to be on the safe side.\n"
