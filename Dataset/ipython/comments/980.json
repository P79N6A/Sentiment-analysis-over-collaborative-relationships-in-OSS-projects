    "body": "I reran the examples (not on WinHPC), and updated the docs accordingly.  I did find some typos / issues from when the mcpricer example was turned into a notebook, and fixed those as well.\n\nSomething to note (/cc @ellisonbg): a notebook that relies on the implicit figure-closing behavior of the inline backend will not export as a functional script, because all plots will be to the same figure.  It will also suffer from this problem if the inline backend is not used, or even if the inline backend is used with `InlineBackend.close_figures=False`.  Relying on this behavior for anything other than a demo _of the notebook_ is probably not a good idea.\n"
