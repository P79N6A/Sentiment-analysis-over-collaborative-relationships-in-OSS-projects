    "body": "Some comments:\n- **BUG 1: (Itemize)**  If you open your notebook with nbviewer [link](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/gist.githubusercontent.com/schlichtanders/e108ed0be80108178af2/raw/4882e7b6c86e0a23f85b1c81a2b3785408e314fb/latex_test.ipynb), you will notice that the itemization works but depends on the used markdown parser. In my tests I got good results if I separate the list from the surrounding paragraphs by a blank line.\n- **BUG 2, 3 and 7: (Raw NBConvert cells)** I think you misinterpret the nature of raw NBConvert cells. These cells are **not** verbatim blocks but rather insert the given text _raw_, i.e without any modification, into the target document. Hence, there are of course no line breaks and the math environment works as expected. What you might want is a verbatim block, which you have to add yourself (e.g. at the beginning of the raw NBConvert cell).\n- **BUG 4: (Math)** The conversion of the markdown text to latex text is done by pandoc. As shown [here](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#math) the issue with an space after the opening $ is well known, see also #5438. It is funny however, that a space before the closing $ work. \n- **BUG 5 and 6: (Backslash)** Pandoc passes \"raw latex\" commands, i.e words starting with an non-escaped backslash unchanged to the output document, hence you would insert a latex keyword this way. However, this inclusion only works with latex see e.g. #3503. In this sense a simple backslash should not be erased, but rather passed as `\\<space>` (non-breaking space) to the tex document.\n- **BUG 8: (math environments)** Unfortunately, there is some difference in the notebook and the final latex document due to the different markdown parsers. There have been some issues related to this bug, but as far as I know there is no real solution yet.\n"

    "body": "The conversion of markdown to html is currently done by [mistune](https://github.com/lepture/mistune). Before it was [marked.js](https://github.com/chjj/marked) and sometime before [pagedown](https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/wiki/PageDown). There exist a lot of different markdown parsers, all with their individual strengths and weaknesses. I'm not sure if pandoc was once used to convert to html, but it is very likely due to compatibility reasons.\nSo all in all the result of the nbconversion of a notebook to html is in a steady change :smile: \n"
