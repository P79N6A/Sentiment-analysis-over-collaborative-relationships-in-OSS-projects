That would make sense because we can't add a limit to every kernel simultaneously.\r\n\r\nNeither of them should affect `dir()`, as far as I know. If that's behaving oddly, it's either something about the objects you're working with (e.g. maybe pandas has some limit of its own), or it's a limit in Python (seems unlikely, but you never know)."
