I guess that means the version check is not acceptable, as the fact that old PySide has been imported seems to mean that PyQt will not be functional.\n\nThis means that we should not warn, but actually raise an ImportError if we get to PySide that is too old, informing the user about QT_API, if they want to use PyQt.\n\nWhich, in turn, would mean that users who have PyQt and out-of-date PySide cannot use the qtconsole with an unconfigured environment.  I'm not sure if this is a general issue that affects any users with old PySide and good PyQt, or if it is particular to this environment.  If it is a general issue, we should raise an error.  If it is _not_ general, then I don't know what would be best.  Adding a warning on every startup of a perfectly functional setup would certainly be annoying.\n"

    "body": "I don't see a problem making pyqt our default for a while: since absent pyqt we still try to fall back onto pyside, things will continue to work normally for EPD users, who will simply see pyside.  But it will also mean that those who happen to have both pyside and pyqt on their systems (common in linux distros) can get the still-more-robust pyqt.\n\nWhile I certainly hope pyside does very well in the future (I was super sad with the whole nokia saga of going to windows and abandoning their linux/qt work), we should be pragmatic for our users for now.\n"
