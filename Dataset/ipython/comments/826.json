I imagine I can adjust it in such a way that the tasks are pulled into Python, instead of left in the buffer.\n"

The Hub (the process that maintains the DB) will not get tasks submitted while there are no engines, because the TaskScheduler never calls recv, leaving messages in the upstream ØMQ buffer.  Essentially the queue processing is paused slightly further upstream than you would like.  I will look into addressing this.\n"
