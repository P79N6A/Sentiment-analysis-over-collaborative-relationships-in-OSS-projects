    "body": "The bindings we have currently were chosen specifically because they are the standard bash keybindings. Since the Qt console is first and foremost a console widget, we would like to keep those as the defaults.\n\nThat said, having user configurable keybindings would be a great enhancement. Unfortunately, I don't think that's likely to be done in the near future. At least, I don't have the spare cycles for it.\n\nYou are, of course, welcome to take a stab at this yourself. If you'd like some guidance, just ask. Otherwise, feel free to open a feature request issue, and hopefully it will get picked up eventually.\n"

    "body": "Hm, I don't exactly have lots of spare time, but I think I could actually see myself getting this done fairly quickly. I'm pretty comfortable with Qt and its keybindings from working on my own code.\n\nI would need some guidance though. I guess this would require giving official names to each action, and some kind of dictionary mapping config key names into proper Qt key names. Maybe someone can propose a couple of keybinding examples, like how to designate in a config file (*.py ?) the key command for `delete_previous_word`, to establish a convention that I could simply extend to all the existing actions.\n"

    "body": "It seems to me the right way to do this is to wait for #492 to get merged (almost ready).  At that point, the Qt console will have a proper config file support, and it will be much easier to experiment.  \n\nThis is, for example, the format used by LyX:\n\n<pre>\n\\bind \"C-e\" \"line-end\"\n\\bind \"C-a\" \"line-begin\"\n\\bind \"C-d\" \"char-delete-forward\"\n\\bind \"C-i\" \"font-emph\"\n\\bind \"C-S-t\" \"buffer-update pdf2\"\n</pre>\n\n\nwhich follows how Emacs describes keybindings as well.\n\nI don't think the `\\bind` syntax looks particularly nice, but the key descriptions seem fine, and it's just a matter for us of sorting out how to describe actions.\n\nBut it seems to me that this should become a separate issue, since your pull request here can be reviewed/merged on its own merits as an existing improvement.  So I suggest we clear this PR as-is, and if you're interested in tackling this one, perhaps open an issue for the design discussion, from which you can then link to a PR once you have code ready.\n\nYou're also welcome to ping for more feedback on the -dev list, as always (sometimes people don't respond to open issues right away).\n"
