Im sorry, but how exactly can we get it working now? \n\nIf I define the following function:\n\n```\ndef my_func(x,y,a=1,b=1):\n    val = np.sin(a*x**2 + b*y**2)\n    return val\n```\n\nI then to try to only plot the particular slices interactively as:\n\n```\n# Make 3D Plot:\n\n# setup the 3D Grid of points\nx = np.arange(-3, 3, 0.025)              # points in the x axis\ny = np.arange(-3, 3, 0.025)              # points in the y axis\nXGrid, YGrid = np.meshgrid(x, y)                # create the \"base grid\"\n\n# calculate your function on this grid\nZ = my_func(XGrid,YGrid)\n\n# setup 3D figure\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(20,5));\n# Create 3D Subplot\nax1 = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 1, projection='3d')\n# plot it on the sublot\nax2 = fig.add_subplot(2,2,2)\n# plot it on the sublot\nax3 = fig.add_subplot(2,2,4)       \n\n# 3D Plot\nax1.plot_surface(XGrid, YGrid, Z,     # data values (2D Arryas)\n               rstride=2,           # row step size\n               cstride=2,           # column step size\n               cmap=cm.RdPu,       # colour map\n               linewidth=0,         # wireframe line width\n               antialiased=True,\n               alpha=0.3);\n\n# interactive plotting\ndef plot_slices(x_val, y_val,ax2,ax3):\n    ## plot x slice\n\n    # setup y value\n    y = np.arange(-3,3,0.025)\n\n    # calculate function for that x_value\n    z = my_func(x_val,y)\n\n    ax2.plot(y,z, 'r--');\n\n    # setup figure asthetics\n    ax2.set_xlabel('y axis');\n    ax2.set_ylabel('z axis');\n    ax2.set_title('A slice in x: f(' + str(np.round(x_val,2)) + ', y)');\n\n    ## plot y slice\n\n    # setup x values\n    x = np.arange(-3,3,0.025)\n\n    # calculate function for that y_value\n    z = my_func(x,y_val)\n\n    # plot it on the sublot\n    ax3.plot(x,z, 'b--');\n\n    # setup figure asthetics\n    ax3.set_xlabel('y axis');\n    ax3.set_ylabel('z axis');\n    ax3.set_title('A slice in y: f(x,' + str(np.round(y_val,2)) + ')');\n\n\ninteract(plot_slices, x_val=(-3,3,0.1), y_val=(-3,3,0.1),ax2=fixed(ax2),ax3=fixed(ax3));\n```\n\nBut that doesn't work. I get an initial plot and then upon moving the sliders  the entire figure disappears. The only way to make it work is to have it declare the figure and axes inside the function everytime!\n"
