    "body": "The problem is in [`IPython/lib/lexers.py`](/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/lib/lexers.py#L54):\n\n``` python\nipython_tokens = [\n  (r\"(?s)(\\s*)(%%)(\\w+)(.*)\", bygroups(Text, Operator, Keyword, Text)),\n  (r'(?s)(^\\s*)(%%!)([^\\n]*\\n)(.*)', bygroups(Text, Operator, Text, using(BashLexer))),\n...\n]\n```\n\nIf a cell begins in `%%`, the entire cell is treated as text. Bash has been special-cased in one form ([which isn't documented](http://ipython.readthedocs.org/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#cellmagic-bash)); [all other cell magics](http://ipython.readthedocs.org/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#cell-magics) will cause the cells to not be rendered.\n\nA simple fix would be to add tokens above these for each of the built-in cell magics, handling the cell content as appropriate (along the lines of using `BashLexer` above).\n\nA more intelligent fix would be to have each cell magic handler provide its own token, and have `lexers.py` collate and insert them before `ipython_tokens`. This would have the benefit of enabling custom cell magics to define how they get highlighted.\n"
