    "body": "Thank you for your answer, Thomas !\n\nI understand it is a very specific case and I hesitated before reporting \nthe issue.\nWhy I reported it:\n- every other applications I launched with AutoHotKeys (relying on \n  cmd.exe or not) in the same context have\n   no issue with Ctrl-C,\n- it is easy to test: install AHK \n  (http://l.autohotkey.net/AutoHotkey_L_Install.exe), create a \n  test_IPython.ahk\n  file and inside put the line hereafter, then launch the script:\n  \n  ```\n   Run C:\\Python27\\python.exe \"C:\\Python27\\scripts\\ipython-script.py\"\n  ```\n\nYou will note Ctrl-C has no effect :-(\n\nI guess this may have something to do with interact() method of class \nTerminalInteractiveShellinside\ninteractiveshell.py, where exists a \"double-guard against keyboard \ninterrupts during kbdint handling\".\n\nI tried many workarounds, including usage of alternate console solution \n(Console2), without change.\n\nI think this issue report may reveal a very vicious bug.\nIt is up to you to decide to investigate or not (obviously). Keep in \nmind AutoHotKeys is a very mature soft\nand the test case is very simple.\n\nI thank you for any help.\n\nBest regards,\n\nLaurent\n\nLe 11/15/2012 3:19 PM, Thomas Kluyver a écrit :\n\n> I don't think we have anyone using that, so it may be up to you to \n> debug it.
