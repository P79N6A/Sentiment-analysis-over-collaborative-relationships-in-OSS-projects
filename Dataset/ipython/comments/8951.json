After changing pep8_magic.py it would report the failure above and would force me to restart the kernel.\n2) Note sure this matters as it fails with every module, this seems a core failure as it can't find `ipython` to make start the reload.\n3) It doesn't look like it... I can't seem to generate the same error.\n\nI understand that reloading may not be possible, but this error seems to imply it is not even being attempted.\n"
