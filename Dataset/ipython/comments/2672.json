I started the notebook with the command: ipython notebook --profile myProfile\n\nLike this it does not work, but issuing the command \"ipython notebook --profile myProfile --pylab inline\"works!!\n1. It would be neat to put every option into ipython_notebook_config.py instead of half and half, so that I can just call \"ipython notebook --profile myProfile\" is it possible?\n2. It looks to me counter-intuitive that we need to use the pylab option but additionally tell ipython to not import the libraries, what does the pylab option do then?

    "body": "Hi, \n\nSorry for the brevity of the first response it was from my phone. `--pylab=inline` is equivalent to `c.IPKernelApp.pylab = 'inline'` in your config file. Changing the config files in `profile_default` folder allows you to just do `ipython notebook`, which is even simpler.\n\nThe import question comes from time to time, but one of the important reason why we keep the current behavior of `--pylab` is for backward compatibility.  Is is true that the `--pylab`  became almost only associated to in people mind with inline figures or not.  Even if at the beginning Pylab goal is to unify API and weaken inconsistencies between APIs.\n"

    "body": "> 1. It looks to me counter-intuitive that we need to use the pylab option but additionally tell ipython to not import the libraries, what does the pylab option do then?\n\nPylab's primary purpose is not imports, but _integration_.  It does three things:\n1. set the matplotlib backend\n2. hook up with eventloop associated with that backend (if any).\n3. user-space imports (optional)\n\nThe user-space imports are just sugar, which you can disable if you want, and  the eventloop integration can be done separately with `%gui`.  Step 1. is the core of `%pylab`.\n\n>  And why is it not independent from the \"inline\" option?\n\nBecause `--pylab inline` means \"use IPython inline figures as the matplotlib backend\" (step 1. above). An `--inline` command that doesn't do anything associated with matplotlib wouldn't actually do anything at all.\n"
