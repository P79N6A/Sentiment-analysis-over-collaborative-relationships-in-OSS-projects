    "body": "I'm guessing you meant 'have_readline' instead of 'has_readline', as the latter gives an AttributeError and the Former does not.  So here's what I get:\n\n```\nIn [2]: readline = get_ipython().shell.readline\n\nIn [3]: readline._rl\nOut[3]: <module 'readline' from '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/7.0/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload/readline.so'>\n\nIn [4]: readline.have_readline\nOut[4]: True\n\nIn [5]: readline.uses_libedit\nOut[5]: False\n```\n\nAs for the other questions, it seems to be any buffer - normal, empty, and multiline (by this you mean the buffer that comes up with loops that has the ...: at the beginning,right) all exhibit the same behavior.  It also happens with ctrl-E, arrow key, and ctrl-F (although for ctrl-F and the right arrow key of course I have to already be at the \"normal\" end of the line).\n\nIt does _not_ happen, however, when I use option-right arrow or option-down - I mapped those to \\033f and \\005 to get end-of-line and one-word-right, respectively.  They seem to be the only ones that don't see the extra character.\n\nTwo additional items to note:  I tried it again with my headphones on and noted that if I go to the apparent end of the line and go to the right (into the ghost character), the bell doesn't sound, but a second right-arrow does trigger the bell... so it's only one character, initially.  If I then type while on the ghost character, go back to the regular characters, and then hit delete, one of two things seems to randomly happen: Either I hit delete as many times as the number of characters I typed+1 and then start hearing the bell for later deletes, or after the first ghost character is deleted, the text after the ghost appears!  This suggests to me that the ghost character is a newline or something like that.\n"
