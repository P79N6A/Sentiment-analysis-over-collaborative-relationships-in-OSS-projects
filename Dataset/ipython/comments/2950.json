However, if I understand correctly, it will force users to group all initialization code under certain headings, instead of forcing users to mark them as initialization cells. The benefit of this is not obvious to me.\n"

    "body": "The principle is more or less the same, and running all cell in a group is right now pretty easy as we already have a `run above` and `run below` so we probably have a prive `run between`. \n\nThe core of the extension will probably just be a cell toolbar checkbox and a button to run code on marked cell. \nThe only difference would be wether this apply to the all \"section\" on only to marked cells. And if we go toward the inheritance principle we speek about it won't make much of differences.\n\nIn any case this particular \"extension\" will probably not make it's way into the core, so a gist of it as a \"demo\" cannot harm...Well as long as you don't auto evaluate those cell as load time...\n"
