And we likely don't have the same sample of terminal users.\nWe did adventure to some fancy keyboard in the past (agreed on notebook, so browser...), and we ended up preventing people from typing a minus (which is useful).

C-v is \"insert literally next character\", which might be useful as well. So we should likely be careful. \n\nWith all these consideration I'm leaning toward :  \n- User who care can rebind [yes we need more docs and a simpler way].\n- User who will be annoyed have no clue how to deals with broken keybindings. \n\nA (maybe better?) solution would be to have more keymaps, a \"default\" one, which is limited and play it \"safe\", then the `emacs` and `vi` ones that are opt-in and more opinionated.\n"

I agree that if emacs users want lots of their shortcuts, we should possibly offer a separate mode for that and rename the default. (Ping @jonathanslenders )\n"

But I guess OS X is implicitly more reasonable than other systems for terminal use because the OS level shortcuts don't use control. Alt-v enters `√` with the default US English keyboard, by the way. \n\nIf you don't want to rebind C-v and M-v (though I still think you should, for emacs mode), maybe bind C-p and C-n to what page up/down currently do? That was the first thing I tried. \n\nAlternate thought: it seems that part of the issue here is that emacs mode is the default, but really you want the default to be \"reasonable\" mode, and have a separate \"emacs\" mode for emacs users, just like there's a \"vi\" mode for vi users. \n"
