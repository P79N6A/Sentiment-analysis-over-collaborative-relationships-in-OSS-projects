    "body": "Hey Madhu,\n\nmany thanks for this!  I'm really sorry that in a lot of travel I've had since India, I completely fell behind on IPython and never worked on this.  Totally my fault, and for that I apologize.\n\nYou may have seen on the list that Thomas has actually tackled a major refactor of the history system that moves to an SQLite backend, so it may be that much of what Satra, you, others and I did in India will get significantly redone with this approach.  So let's give this a few more days until we see if Thomas' ideas pan out.  \n\nI encourage you to participate in the discussions on the list if you have any thoughts on that stuff.  And sorry again for falling behind on the code review!\n"
