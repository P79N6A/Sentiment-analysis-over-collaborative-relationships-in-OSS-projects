    "body": "Yes, same break is on Win XP. Broke at our 71fcb6294e1a5e30c88fcf2045b4406764ebd803, which added a test file. This test file runs ok on its own, but breaks the iptest suite, presumably because it creates a QApplication when, as part of the suite, it should not. Good lesson. We'll look at this tomorrow. \n"
