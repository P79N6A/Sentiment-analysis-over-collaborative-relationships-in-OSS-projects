    "body": "Maybe on Windows it needs the conda environment active to find some DLLs, rather than just running the Python by absolute path.\n\n_Without_ activating the environment, can you try in a command prompt:\n\n```\nd:\\\\Miniconda\\\\envs\\\\py35\\\\python.exe\n```\n\nThen if it starts up, try running `import zmq`.\n\nMatthias:\n\n> maybe activate instead of source activate, but I guess that's just a typo\n\nI think `activate` is correct on Windows. `source` is a bash thing.\n"
