    "body": "I'm not convinced of this design in general for the input/output styles forcing the involvement of so many scattered template files.  It seems quite unnecessarily complicated.\n\nCan you explain why the following does not work:\n\n```\n{ macro: input_area(cell) }\n{ block input_block }\n{ if prompt_style == 'ipython' }\n    { if bw: }\n        {block in_ipython_bw}\n    { else: }\n        {block in_ipython}\n    { endif }\n{ else if prompt_style == 'python' }\n    { if bw: }\n        {block in_python_bw}\n    { else: }\n        {block in_python}\n    { endif }\n{ else: }\n    {block custom_in }\n{ endif }\n{ endblock }\n{ endmacro }\n```\n\nand a similar macro for output.  This seems dramatically simpler than having all of these mixin templates that redefine things, and I tested a similar model in a custom template, and it seemed to work fine.\n\nI recall something said during the meeting about not allowing unused blocks, but in testing, this doesn't appear to be true. You can have plenty of unvisited blocks, it happens pretty much every time a notebook is rendered.\n"

    "body": "I'm not quite sure why you have that macro block, what advantage does that give you over the existing blocks in null template? \n\nThe output blocks are much more complex than the input blocks in that, they redirect to the display priority blocks.  If you have the output code in a separate file (included via include or import), that does not sit directly in the line of inheritance, you cannot perform this redirection since the display data logic belongs to the output template -  it's important that output templates are able to define the methods that describe how media gets written too the document, and for the styles to be able to respect and use that logic.\n\nFor example, if you want a two column template, you'll probably end up overriding the image outputs (among other things) to change the image sizes.  You may want to be able to use the IPython cell style with you template (or any of the other styles).  If the IPython style, and/or other styles, defines the method to write media to the page, then you could run into a large number of issues.\n\nThe coupling of cell style and output template is complicated by the fact that the output template does not just include the cell style, but the cell style must also be able to use blocks from the output template.\n\nAdditionally, some (actually every style except for the black and white templates) require custom Declarations and some of the styles require custom Packages.  If we were to try do it that way (I'm not saying that it would even work nicely) we would not only need a case for each style in the Input and Output macros, but also conditional logic in the Declarations and Package sections.\n\nRight now there is an abstract and a base template, but I prefer to have separate.  There are 4 output templates, article, report, sphinx article, sphinx report and one template for each of the 6 cell styles.  We **could** minimize the file system clutter by merging some of the files together and still using the wonky conditional inheritance.  Personally, I prefer to keep the different logic for each style in different templates.  This may seem non-pythonic by ignoring the idea of one file being a module containing multiple classes, but I think that's okay in this case.\n\nIf you think I don't understand your idea, please provide a MWE (just a couple of files showing me what you envision as far as the inheritance structure is concerned).  Also, I've uploaded examples of how to do what you requested earlier in the nbconvert-examples repository (it's an open PR).\n\n**Also** I'm not sure when I'll be home tonight, I'm going to visit my Dad, so maybe tomorrow we could Skype or Google hangout, it may be a more efficient way to communicate.  We could have others join in too.\n"
