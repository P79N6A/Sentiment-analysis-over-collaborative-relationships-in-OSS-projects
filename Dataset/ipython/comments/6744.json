    "body": "In this example a cubic function f(x) is integrated from x=1 to x=9, however by coincidence it happens that the derivatives on both boundaries are the same. In this case, the [Maclaurin formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Maclaurin_formula) tells us that f(x) can be exactly integrated through the trapezoidal rule. Therefore this example is not suitable to demonstrate the difference between the two. The claimed difference is not down to the trapezoidal rule, but due to the error the points are chosen in the interval [1,9]. \n\nThis is fixed with pull request #7426 by integrating from x=1 to x=8. The implementation of the trapezoid rule is also added for illustration.\n"
