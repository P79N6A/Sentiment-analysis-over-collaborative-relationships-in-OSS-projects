    "body": "Thanks a lot for the proposal. \n\nHum, right now that will be though, but let me make a quick recap of future plan. \n1. get 3.0 out of the door. \n2. get https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-drive out of the door (need 1)\n3. Refactor IPython to support RT colaboration (technically help with what you ask, 2 will help a lot) \n4. Make an Operational Ttransform server (google RT like) backend for RT communication (independant of 1-3 mostly, but knowing google RT API would help to make things compatible)\n5. Make kernel speek with (4) instead of browser. \n\nDepending on what you want to work on there are plenty to do. \nEven just playing with IPython master, testing Pull request, or reviewing code\nis of huge help as it free us time to work on more complex stuff.\n\nEven if you are just better at communicating that we are, and know a bit about our future plan, \neven proposing a news to be posted on main ipython.org website would be awesome !\n\nI should probably make a blog post that details more what we are doing :-P \n"

    "body": "I think if the notebook could have **another V layer** to capture all the progress data. The browser will interact with this layer instead of raw python kernel. The problem could be solved. (Like a long running proxy browser on your server)  This doesn't seem to be a small surgery.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut another idea I have is more like frontend point of view. If the jupyter notebook supports server rendering someday using react/angular2.js/etc...  then this problem will be automatically solved. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis feature is very important, since jupyter notebook is extremely popular among machine learning development workflow. Some algorithm training programs could last a couple of days. "
