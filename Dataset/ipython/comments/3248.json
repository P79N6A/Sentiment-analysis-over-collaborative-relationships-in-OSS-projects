    "body": "Yup, I see it.  Presumably it's the empty-line cell magic fix.\n\nThe issue that seems to be coming up is that 'when is input done' and splitting input that has been received should _not_ be the same action.  When IPython gets a cell to run, be it via `run_cell`, a cell magic, or something like %paste, under no circumstances should that ever be split.  That is an action totally unrelated to the 'is it done' check that implicitly-ending console-like frontends require (terminal, qtconsole).\n"
