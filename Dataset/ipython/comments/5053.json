The folder names == test group name, but I use an explicit if/elif block in iptestcontroller to map the group names to folder names.  Maybe it would be better if this mapping was implicit?  Or is that too magical? See here - https://github.com/jdfreder/ipython/commit/a61cd87dda1fa11b799219e95e957458fae8ce65#diff-f7b20eb6befe7d2ed0f2b0a61f1b9c36R185\n"

Also, I remove `tests\\casperjs`...\n\nThe structure follows:\n- tests\\util.js\n- tests\\base*.js\n- tests\\notebook*.js\n- tests\\services*.js\n- tests\\tree*.js  <- (I put the dashboard tests in here, is that right @ellisonbg ?)\n- tests\\widgets*.js\n\nThe thought is that in another PR the main widgets folder will get moved out of the notebook/ folder in static (since the widgets don't event require any IPython specific elements to work).\n"
