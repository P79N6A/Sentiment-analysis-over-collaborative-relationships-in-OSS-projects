    "body": "We deal with this all over IPython already. In general, we take the Python 3 approach, but use Python 2 nomenclature:\n- `bytes` is a sequence of 8-bit numbers (bytes)\n- `unicode` - a sequence of _characters_\n\nIn Python 2, `str is bytes`, whereas in Python 3 `str is unicode`.  Python 2 confuses things by having encode and decode methods on _both_ objects, which lets you get all turned around in terms of what you are actually working with.  Python 3 clarifies some of these things by only having `encode` on non-bytes, and `decode` on bytes.\n"

    "body": "Further clarification of the confusion re: base64, which is totally from the text encodings.  b64 is a bytes-to-bytes conversion that turns raw bytes to ascii bytes. This is doubly confusing because the encode direction for b64 is backwards - With b64, you take raw bytes and then encode them as ascii text, which you can then put in a unicode object (for JSON).  So in the notebook, we have these things:\n1. in the notebook document, we have binary data stored as base64-encoded _text_ (a unicode object)\n2. we want this as the raw bytes\n3. base64 is a bytes-to-bytes conversion\n\nSo we must make two simple transforms:\n1. turn ascii _text_ into ascii _bytes_ (there is no logical transform, only a change of underlying data structure)\n2. decode those ascii _bytes_ into the original raw _bytes_.\n\nThis is true on any version of Python, but Python 2 lets us do it wrong be allowing base64 to be used like a regular encoding, which it really isn't, and calling `decode` methods on unicode objects, which also makes no sense.\n"
