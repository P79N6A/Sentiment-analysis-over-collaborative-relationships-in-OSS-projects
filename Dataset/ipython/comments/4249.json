    "body": "pinfo (what `?` is short for) doesn't evaluate the line, so you don't get any information about the results of expressions, because they don't exist. Since the evaluation of the expression can be arbitrarily expensive, we don't want to be executing code that the user hasn't actually requested to execute.\n\nWe have the same behavior in completion, where there is an option (greedy) to allow evaluation of expressions prior to completion. This is off by default, but it is an option. Perhaps we could add a similar (off by default) option to pinfo.\n"
