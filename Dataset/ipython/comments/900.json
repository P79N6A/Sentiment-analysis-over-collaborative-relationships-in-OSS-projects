    "body": "#513 isn't actually other issues, it's exactly this.  It was misunderstood as the wrong number of spaces because tabs align with tab-stops, so vary in width.\n\nI added a fix to the qtconsole-menu PR, as it's two lines. Should close both issues.\n\nNow that tabs=4sp is so standard, you might think the Python interpreter would stop reading tabs as _8_ spaces with respect to indentation:\n\n```\nexec \"def foo():\\n\\ta=5\\n        return a\\nprint foo()\"\n```\n"
