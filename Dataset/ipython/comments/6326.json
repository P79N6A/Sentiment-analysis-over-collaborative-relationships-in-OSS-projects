I'm going to merge this, and if you feel more is needed, feel free to open more PR. \n\nDon't hesitate to push a bit if we don't respond especially for qtconsole where we should mostly merge without asking too much questions. \n\nSorry for the switch from need review to waiting for author;  By reading too fast I thought someone was asking you for a fix before merging. \n\nThanks , and merging. ! \n"
