It would be really nice to reduce the amount of URL composition we do in Javascript, but I don't think we should do _that_ refactor for 3.0, so I would either:\n\nA. add the links to the REST API in 3.0, but don't use them in Javascript, yet\nB. add the links to the REST API and start using them in Javascript for 4.0\n\nSince we are trying to do our best to start cutting off proposals for 3.0, I would go with B unless the benefit is really substantial.\n"
