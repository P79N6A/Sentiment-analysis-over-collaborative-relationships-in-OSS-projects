The terminal zmq console is not intended to be especially full featured, and lots of kernels, including my own, don't bother to implement history, because they're more interested in the notebook.\n\nI have actually wondered if it makes sense for history to be a kernel function at all - the frontends could be responsible for storing history (with some advantages and some disadvantages when kernels are remote). But I definitely don't want to get into redesigning that at the moment.\n"
