This ended up looking weird.  \n- Displaying the broken link somewhere else on the page, like the top right.  \n- Making the icon like a pill (red background and white text).  Both @ellisonbg and I thought this was too much, but maybe it could be fine tuned to work better.\n"

    "body": "Have we contacted Travis support email (support@travis-ci.com) to report\nthis issue and talk about options? Are we that unhappy with Travis that we\nwould not try hard to get this resolved with them? I am all for using the\nbest solution possible, but given the high number of tests we run, it is\nnot obvious that other CI platforms won't have similar issues. If it gets\nbad again, let's email them. Again, keep in mind that our _time_ is the\nmost expensive thing for the project right now - a few hundred $'s for\nsolid CI support is a deal...\n\n@fperez\n\nOn Tue, Dec 16, 2014 at 12:05 PM, Thomas Kluyver notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> I don't imagine that Travis would do anything other than pointing to the\n> pricing page we already saw, and that doesn't seem terribly attractive. We\n> haven't spent all that much time getting stuff working on Travis (as\n> opposed to time trying to speed things up on Travis), and I think it makes\n> sense to explore other options.\n> \n> Travis seems a bit quicker today - this PR got checked within about 20\n> minutes of the latest commit.\n> \n> 窶能n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/7227#issuecomment-67222561.\n\n## \n\nBrian E.
