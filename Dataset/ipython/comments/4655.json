We have a few choices:\n1. use python-markdown for HTML output\n   - \\+ Python dependency\n   - \\- doesn't support the same markdown features (gfm, tables, etc.) as live or pandoc\n2. use pandoc\n   - \\+ same reader for markdown all over nbconvert\n   - \\+ supports all the same extended markdown as marked (gfm, tables, etc.), and more\n   - \\- but it still parses things a bit differently, especially wrt math / latex, empty lines\n3. use marked\n   - \\+ same renderer as live notebook\n   - \\- have to extract/re-add math around it, like we do in js (incorrectly, atm)\n   - \\- depends on node\n\nHonestly, none of these are awesome. In some respects, bringing pandoc up to snuff via either plugins or patches is the most appealing. I think python-markdown is a no-go, with too many unsupported behaviors, unless we want to turn off the extensions in marked.\n"

See this [post](http://peter-hoffmann.com/2012/python-markdown-github-flavored-code-blocks.html) for an explanation of how to get GFM.  I think I've seen something similar for getting MathJax working as well.  My biggest concern is that two different code paths will ultimately be untenable, and that we'll either need Python in the browser via a tool like Native Client, or we'll have to live with more Javascript at the command line.  Pandoc is an awesome tool, but I don't see it in the browser any time soon.\n"
