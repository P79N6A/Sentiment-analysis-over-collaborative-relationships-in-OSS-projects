    "body": "The reason a message is printed is that, even if you set `pylab_import_all` to false, it still puts some things in your namespace, like `plt` and `np`. The message could certainly be clearer in that case. We're now leaning towards using the `%matplotlib` magic, which works like %pylab, but doesn't put anything in your namespace.\n"
