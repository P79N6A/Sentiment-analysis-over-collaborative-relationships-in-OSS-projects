    "body": "There are two distinct issues here: converting an object to a traitlet, and converting the traitlet to AND from JSON.  The first issue is better handled by writing a new traitlet (or possibly writing a generic from_jsonable traitlet that does use _repr_json to cast to an Any object), and the second issue is handled by the to/from_json functions we wrote.  It sounds like the generic Any_from_repr_json traitlet is what is desired here---you don't want any bidirection communication (i.e., you don't want the link object updated, do you?)?\n"
