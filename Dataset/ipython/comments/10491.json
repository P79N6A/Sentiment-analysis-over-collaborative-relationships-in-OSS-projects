    "body": "`_ipython_display_` is meant to handle the case of \"Returning a representation is insufficient, I'm going to make display calls myself\", such as objects that need to make multiple display calls to get what they need displayed (e.g. widgets). However, since IPython lacked a *light* \\* way to register custom mime-types, `_ipython_display_` was the only way to do that. I just opened https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/10496 to define the custom mime-type method, which should handle cases like this one.\r\n\r\nTechnically, you *can* publish `execute_result` messages yourself in `_ipython_display_`, but you would have a hard time identifying which context you are in without inspecting frames or doing some other non-so-nice bookkeeping.\r\n\r\n\\* you can register a formatter for your mime-type, which would obviate the need for `_ipython_display_`. The downside for this is that you have to do this explicitly at some point."
