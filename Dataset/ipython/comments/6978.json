I think that this was the last obvious place where external kernels were treated wrong (other than what has been mentioned).\n\nAdded the file_extension to metakernel base classes https://github.com/blink1073/metakernel/commit/0dcb3860269c8ac576f3dc0900d10ec200c1fa7b \n\nIt would be nice that **if** something like `language_info.start_comment_str` was defined, to also export the other cells, output, etc. But this is a great start!\n"
