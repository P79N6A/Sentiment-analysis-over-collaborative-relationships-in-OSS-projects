The last statement is an assignment, `soup=...` Ipython does not display the value of the last assignment. \r\n\r\nSee the difference between finishing a cell with a value or an assignment: \r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [5]: 1\r\nOut[5]: 1\r\n\r\nIn [6]: a=1\r\n\r\nIn [7]:\r\n```\r\n\r\nNothing get printed when you assign to a. \r\n\r\nIf you want to see `a` you'll have to put it alone on a line: \r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [12]: a=1\r\n    ...: a\r\nOut[12]: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nsecond cell, `soup.select('.feed-card-item')` is an empty list:\r\n```\r\nIn [1]: import requests\r\n   ...: from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\r\n   ...: res=requests.get('https://news.sina.com.cn/china/')\r\n   ...: res.encoding='utf-8'\r\n   ...: soup=BeautifulSoup(res.text, 'html.parser')\r\n\r\nIn [2]: soup.select('.feed-card-item')\r\nOut[2]: []\r\n```\r\nI manually check the page, there is 0 `'.feed-card-item`\r\nSo you are looping over 0 items and thus printing none. \r\nNote that what you are getting with Beautifulsoup may differ from what you have in your browser if you need to log-in. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
