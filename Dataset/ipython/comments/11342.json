    "body": "The input transformation machinery all changed in 7.0; there were known problems with token transformers in the previous API (#10893) and I doubt anyone has the time to go back and fix it.\r\n\r\nThe new (7.0) API is now documented here:\r\nhttps://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/inputtransforms.html\r\n\r\nThe new API does not expose token-based transformers as a public API - we're using them internally, but the API felt too fragile to encourage other people to rely on. If you want to figure them out by reading code and write some of your own, feel free to, but future versions of IPython may well break it."
