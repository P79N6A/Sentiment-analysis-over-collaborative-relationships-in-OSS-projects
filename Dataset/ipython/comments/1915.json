    "body": "If we do this, we should also add a metadata dict to each worksheet as well.  Right now worsheets are just kept in a list, and I imagine once we have UI for them (even if it doesn't happen for 0.13), people will immediately want to, at the very list, name them.  And I can immediately think of other things to do with sheet-level metadata.\n\nIt would also give us consistently metadata support at the various levels of our hierarchy: notebook, worksheet, cell.  It seems that would lead to a nice, uniform model.\n"
