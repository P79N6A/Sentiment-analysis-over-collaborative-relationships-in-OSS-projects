Maybe it would be better to have:\n\n  Append contents of the cell to an existing file (avoids prompt).\n  The file…\n\nas the --append docs, and to have the docstring be just:\n\n  \"\"\"Write the contents of the cell to a file.\n  \"\"\"\n\n?\n\nThere's also some trailing whitespace in the line before `if ans:`.\n"

Now there is no distinguishing between the two, so the notebook can go back to being safe without being useless.  The issue was that a notebook with %%file could not be run twice if it didn't overwrite, since it couldn't prompt, so it would just fail. That is no longer true, so it can just prompt by default, as it always should have done, and the more interactive frontends originally did.\n"
