Unfortunately, we're planning to drop support for python2.6 in ipython 2.0 (which will allow us to eliminate 2to3 and use a single code-base as is for both python2.7 and 3.3+). I hope this doesn't deter you from future contributions. Hope we'll catch you further down the commit log :+1:\n"

We intend to provide source-only security fixes for the Python 2.6 series until October 2013 (five years after the 2.6 final release).\n\nOf course RHEL will probably continue to support Python 2.6 well into the future.  As @takluyver indicates you can follow the `1.x` branch which is actively maintained, or you can easily install a pre-packaged Python distribution like Anaconda, Enthought Canopy, etc.\n"
