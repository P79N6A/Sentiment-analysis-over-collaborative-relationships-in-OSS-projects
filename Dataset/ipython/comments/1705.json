    "body": "So I have been thinking about making the notebook keyboard shortcuts modal.  What I mean by this is that I want to make it so that selecting a cell does not focus the code mirror editor.  This will enable us to implement things like multiple selection and other cell+notebook level keyboard shortcuts.  In a modal editor you need a keyboard shortcut to initiate editing the selected cell.  For that I am thinking about using RETURN, which will focus the code mirror editor.  To stop editing, I think that ESC makes the most sense because it doesn't mean anything when you are editing a cell.  BUT, if we use ESC for that, I don't think we should use ESC for collapsing the pager.  Thoughts on this @fperez, @minrk, @takluyver ?\n\nOther than this point, I think this PR is ready to merge, unless others want to test it more.\n"
