    "body": "I guess the idea was that an equation by itself (i.e. displayed with the `Math` class) should be left aligned, like any other output would be. Possibly it doesn't make sense for block equations in markdown. Can you see a way of making the CSS selector more specific so it would differentiate between those cases?"

    "body": "This is markdown instead of latex, so that's one difference that could be used. `output_markdown rendered_html` is unique to this case, where as just `output_latex` is on the output of Math (ignoring attributes they both share).\r\n\r\nBut, really, even for Math, the output does an irritating jump from middle to left of the screen. I think the Math should be inline style (`$x$` in markdown) vs. display style (`$$x$$`) if it is intended to be left aligned as an output, or it should be able to change the the MathJax HTML output `<div class=\"MathJax_Display\" style=\"text-align: center;\">` which is causing the jump and forcing the `!important` rule."
