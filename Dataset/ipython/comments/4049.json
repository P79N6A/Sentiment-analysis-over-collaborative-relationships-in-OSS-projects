    "body": "I think this makes sense. I'd be inclined to explicitly put the default (i.e. `...get('SHELL', None)`), just to make it clear what the fallback is. Also, an explanatory comment and a tweak to the docstring are in order.\n\nMore importantly, the return code from `subprocess.call()` is in a different format from that returned by `os.system()` - the former uses positive numbers for exit statuses, and negative for terminating signals, while the latter packs the two into a two-byte number. We should ensure that it's doing something consistent. Pinging @jasongrout, who expressed an interest in this on the mailing list a couple of weeks ago.\n\nI wouldn't try to make the equivalent change for Windows: the docs only say \" If shell=True, on Unix the executable argument specifies a replacement shell for the default /bin/sh.\" And the whole nature of shells is different on Windows, and I don't know much about it.\n\n@dpsanders : That's likely a separate issue. The notebook doesn't even use this code by default, as far as I'm aware (it uses `system_piped`, this is `system_raw`). You may want to open a separate issue if it's something that you can replicate.\n"

    "body": "Sorry, I don't think the latest change is quite right. I should have explained what I wanted better.\n\nos.system return codes are: \"a 16-bit number, whose low byte is the signal number that killed the process, and whose high byte is the exit status (if the signal number is zero)\"\n\nsubprocess return codes are a single number, where \"a negative value -N indicates that the child was terminated by signal N (Unix only).\"\n\n`system_raw` on Unix uses the subprocess +/- convention, but on Windows it uses the 2-byte convention. I'm not sure what format `system_piped` returns, so we should check that. We should ensure that they all return an exit code in the same format. I think the +/- convention is the best one to adopt. You can copy the implementation of `subprocess.Popen._handle_exitstatus()` to convert os format to +/- format.\n"
