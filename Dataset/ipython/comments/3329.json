    "body": "@1st: Macs can't ship with readline for licensing reasons (namely: it's GPL), so they have libedit instead to do the same job. Python's readline module therefore tries to use libedit, but it doesn't work properly. Ubuntu doesn't have the problem because it has 'real' readline. (To be fair, I don't know if libedit is still buggy, or if Apple just uses an old version of it)\n\nI don't see us shipping readline with IPython, both for licensing reasons and technical ones.\n"
