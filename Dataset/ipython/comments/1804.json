If it doesn't resolve itself, I'd just close the PR and open a new one.\n\nAs a general tip, we recommend making a feature branch for pull requests - i.e. do `git checkout -b cython-mingw` before committing your changes. That means that everyone can keep 'master' up to date easily. But I don't think that's causing this problem.\n"
