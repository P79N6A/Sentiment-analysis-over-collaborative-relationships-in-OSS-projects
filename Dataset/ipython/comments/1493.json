    "body": "I'm all for writing as many tests as we can cleanly at the unit level in JS, but it seems to me that having some of these integration tests from the browser side would also be immensely valuable.  \n\nBasically with the notebook we're in a very similar position now to where we were a few years ago in the terminal IPython, when we started adding tests to the main code for the first time.  At the beginning we just added a few high-level tests that simulated interactive usage, and while a but coarse and crude, they were already very useful in 'anchoring' our stuff somewhere.  Over time we've become much, much better at increasing our test coverage at a very fine level, and now I actually feel reasonably OK with our overall test suite (I know it's not perfect, but it's far from being bad).\n\nSo I see this in a similar light: it provides a few big tests of the main user-facing experience, that at the very least will help us not break things in gross, catastrophic ways due to some small omission.  I remember with fright how early on, the only way for me to know something hadn't broken in IPython was to try a bunch of things interactively and hope I was exercising it enough.  That's basically where we are with the notebook right now, and I'm again quite afraid.\n\nI think some of these coarse tests will be _super useful_ with the upcoming planned JS refactorings: they will serve as a safety net for the main stuff, and can help us in making the refactoring cleaner.  \n\nObviously they don't preclude that we start writing proper, fine-grained tests in pure JS, and I'm all for that.  But I think the two kinds of testing are complementary, and that we really should consider this, or something like this, very seriously.\n"

Selenium and SauceLabs can let you drive those\nJS tests in an automated fashion across multiple browsers, which seems like\na good idea; SauceLabs will give you videos and screenshots, too.\n\nFor more complex orchestration between Python/IPython and the notebook,\nhaving a single process unit test coordinating the server and the browser\nseems invaluable to me.  (There's a reason why Selenium emerged, and that's a\nlarge part of it.)  With pure JavaScript, you would have to expose a lot of\ntesting-related machinery on the server side.\n\nI also think the Firefox Selenium IDE is a good way to get some basic tests\nup quickly and easily.\n\ncheers,\n\n## --titus\n\nC.
