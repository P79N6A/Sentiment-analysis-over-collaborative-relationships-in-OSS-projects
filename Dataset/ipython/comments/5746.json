    "body": "Yeah! Some feedback:\n- I really like the idea of having an indicator that tell how many cells are selected.\n- I don't think we need to change the colors of the cut/copy/paste buttons in addition to colors the number indicator area. They are still just cut/copy/paste and the number indicator give the user all of the additional information they need.\n- I don't think we can yet use a mouse click on the prompt area to toggle this selection. The reason is that we have to redesign the output/input hiding and scrolling behavior and it will very likely involve the prompt area as well.\n- When we actually pull this into IPython, we should provide an API in notebook.js for managing this different notion of \"selection\".\n- I will have to play with the keyboard shortcuts to see how those feel.\n\nVery cool though...\n"
