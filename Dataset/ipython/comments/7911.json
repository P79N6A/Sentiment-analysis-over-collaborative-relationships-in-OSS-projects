Maybe it would actually be better to have the following behavior:\n- if the build directory is not specified, add the suffix by default\n- if the build directory is not the current directory, always suppress the suffix\n- add an `--inplace` flag, which suppresses the suffix (but in effect only really matters when the build directory isn't specified)\n"
