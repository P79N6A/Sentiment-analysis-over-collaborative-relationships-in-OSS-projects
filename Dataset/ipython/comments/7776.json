    "body": "The default timeout waiting for the kernel info reply is 10 seconds, but that doesn't mean the kernel is treated as dead. It should behave fine, as long as there's no _other_ failure later on. As you can see, the kernel_info reply did arrive 3 seconds after the timeout, so it seems closer to 15 seconds than 40. It's not until 4 seconds later that the kernel dies. The error at the bottom about initializing LinAlg suggests that julia is actually dying due to failing to find openblas, not anything to do with IPython's timeouts.\n\nYou can change the timeout with:\n\n```\nc.NotebookApp.tornado_settings = {'kernel_info_timeout': 60} # default is 10\n```\n\nin your `ipython_notebook_config.py`, but the timeout is unlikely to be related to the kernel dying, here.\n"
