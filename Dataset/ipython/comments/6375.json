Jupyter is normally installed as either Python or conda packages, which can't really do the system integration bits you need to set up file associations. You can also create multiple environments and install different sets of packages into each - so I may have the notebook installed five times on my system; if nbopen has to start a notebook server, how does it know which copy to use?\n\nWe could maybe integrate it so that you called a function or pressed a button to set up the file association with the notebook server you're in, but I don't think we'd include it in the installation by default.\n"
