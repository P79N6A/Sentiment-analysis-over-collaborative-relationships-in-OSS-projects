I wasn't really aware there was a spec when I changed it, I was just making it work.\n\nI didn't like the way that the get_history method did a handful of different things depending on its input, so I split it up into three methods: `get_range`, `get_tail` and `search`. I don't know if it makes more sense to have a different request type for each, or unify them under a history_request with a parameter to specify what kind of request is being made.\n"
