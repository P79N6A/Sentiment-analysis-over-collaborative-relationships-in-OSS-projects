    "body": "I would say that this is likely an issue with sublimeREPL. \n\nThe thing you see are [ansi escape sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code), they are the way to indicate to a terminal that you want a style for the underlying text. usually copy-pasting in software is implemented so that you do not get these escapes sequences out in your clipboard. \n\nI'm marking as \"no action\" as there is not much we can do if we want to display colors. and this will likely be close later. Feel free to post here a link to your sublime repl issue. \n"
