    "body": "I was not aware of #6439, thank you.\n\nI was hoping that, because I call `enable_matplotlib` after `run_cell`, this implementation won't suffer from the issues that @minrk identified in #6439. However, my implementation doesn't fully work either. It works when temporarily changing to the \"inline\" backend but, when changing temporarily to the \"Qt\" backend IPython doesn't create the figure. [Here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/9a87463a9dc34400548e/raw/87ba9837afa92e5f431dfe534335a9d654868206/Test%20matplotlib%20magic%20cell.ipynb) is a notebook to test the feature that highlights the problem.\n\nI guess that this issue could be fixed by calling `enable_matplotlib` after the cell output has been displayed—what's the proper way of doing this? I have tried using  the `set_next_input` method and it works. However,  `set_next_input` pollutes the notebook with one extra cell every time that the matplotlib magic cell is run.\n"

Setting the milestone to 4.0.\n"
