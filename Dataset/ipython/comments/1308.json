Run `ipython console --existing` in another terminal _on the server_ and let's see what happens.\n\n@minrk has more experience than I with debugging connection issues, so the problem may be obvious to him right away.  As far as I can see, at least on git master, it's working correctly on my setup which looks pretty similar to yours.\n"

A few times, there were no ssh tunnels up. A few times, there was one tunnel up. Which one tunnel came up varied; i saw both the hb tunnel and the io tunnel on different trials.\n"
