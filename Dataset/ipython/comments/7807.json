At least for the `a` and `b` shortcuts we should certainly use the terms 'above' and 'below' to help people remember them.\n\n@Carreau this appears to tie into the action names - are we auto generating help strings from action names now? That seems less than ideal, but that's another question. Can you look into this? I think at a minimum we should get rid of 'before' and 'after' in the naming because of the potential confusion with the shortcuts for 'above' and 'below'.\n"

But action names are even less stable that JS API :-P \n\nI'm not sure above an below are the good one as notebook presentation can be non-vertical, like in reveal. Consistency would be great, but \"A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds\".\nAnd where above/below might make sens in some place (UI) before/after make sens (in API)\nso I would be careful in choosing.\n\nping @ellisonbg that will be interested.\n"

    "body": "> I would also bring \"D,D\" entry next to \"I',|\" and \"O,O\". Is \",\" really necessary in those? It is mildly confusing. Why not just \"DD\"?\n\nThe logic that make the keymap is generic. you can bind to `Ctrl-X,Meta-C,Meta-b,u,t,t,e,r,f,l,y` it will understand it. to `Ctrl-X,Meta-C,Meta-b,Meta-u,Meta-t,Meta-t,Meta-e,Meta-r,Meta-f,Meta-l,Meta-y` is different, but would look weird without commas.\n\nIf you think of  a better logic that would be great.\n"
