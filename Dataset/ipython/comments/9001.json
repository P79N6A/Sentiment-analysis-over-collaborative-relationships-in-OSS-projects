The result is the same.\n\nHowever, using the on-line version of Jupyter (at https://tmpnb.org/) it dsplays normally.\n\nI have tried both the version from WinPython, Anaconda and the one from Canopy(Enthought), alas no luck.\n\nI have looked at one possible solution from stack overflow, using regedit. It involved changing application/css in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT to  text/css. this made no difference.\n\nFrom my own experience with markup in webpages, the problem seems like a dropped 'div' tag somewhere or maybe some CSS not linking?\nAny suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n"
