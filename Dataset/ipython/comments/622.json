    "body": "This looks good, but I have a couple of comments:\n- Your test code can be simplified by replacing\n  <pre>\n      ip.magic('pylab')\n      ip.run_cell('a = dir()')\n      ipdir = ip.user_ns['a']\n      has_plot = False\n      for ipd in ipdir:\n          if ipd == 'plot':\n              has_plot = True\n      self.assertTrue(has_plot)\n  </pre>\n\nwith\n\n<pre>\n        ip.magic('pylab')\n        self.assertTrue('plot' in ip.user_ns)\n</pre>\n\n\nwhich is clearer, faster and fully equivalent.\n- The flag should really be added to `core/shellapp.py`, where incidentally all the pylab flags should be moved (right now we have duplicated them in both the terminal and the qt console).  By doing this, we'll remove the duplication and your new option will work for both the terminal and the qt console, which right now it doesn't.\n- @minrk, could you help me out with the following: which is the object that has the fully merged configuration data, that includes the overlaying of the various defaults with the stuff in get_ipython().config?  I'm still a bit fuzzy on those details.\n\nIn summary, I think if we work a bit on this one, not only will we get the import_all situation fixed, but more generally where we handle pylab for all ipython shells.\n"

So indeed, @jenshnielsen, the way to go is to clean things out and put the pylab flags only in the `core.shellapp.InteractiveShellApp` object, and then both the terminal and the Qt console will get them.\n\nFrom looking around, I get the feeling that we need to do a little cleanup of all the classes, but you don't need to worry about that quite now.\n"
