    "body": "The problem is that cProfile (and also regular old profile) imports `__main__` and examines uses its `__dict__` for both globals and locals in \"exec cmd in globals, locals\". `__main__` being a FakeModule instance without any of the IPython prompt namespace available is what makes it fail.\n\nI know the reason that FakeModule exists has something to do with the namespace created for %run executions, but I'm not really sure if there's a way to override its...blankness, when running in interactive mode, without having all hell break loose. I should note also that putting that in a file and %running it works fine, but that's not really a surprise.\n\nI was looking for some low-hanging fruit like the other pull requests I've sent but I think this one is out of my league... hopefully my detective work will let someone pick this up more quickly.\n"

    "body": "Thanks, David!  I've bumped the priority for this one and made FakeModule label so we track all bugs related to this.  It's true that this is not low-hanging fruit, but there are ways to help already: writing a set of tests that encapsulate all the known problems in test form would be a _huge_ help.  Pickling failures, this profile thing, etc.  It would make the job of hunting the actual problem far far easier, right now part of the reason nobody has even tried is precisely that lacking any tests to know what 'fixing' means, we don't even start.\n"
