    "body": "> I had tried to pick a set of colours that are moderately passable on both light and dark background terminals, so I'm kind of annoyed to start IPython today and find that it's assuming a dark background again.\n\nSorry about that, the colors seemed pretty bad on @fperez screen, so we decided to use stronger colors.\nThe reasoning to switch prompt colors is to give feedback when you use `%colors`. \nI honestly forgot the default was different on various platforms. I think you are right that dark theme should be readable on white bg if it can be the default.\n"
