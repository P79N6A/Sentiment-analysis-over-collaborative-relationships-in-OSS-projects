    "body": "There are a couple of reasons to not allow hidden files and directories:\n- Security (.ssh and config of other software that cache security credentials). No other program and I know of exposes a user's entire directory tree to the open internet. We simple cannot do this under any circumstance. This point applies to the dashboard listing and hand edited URLs. 404 is the appropriate response - attackers should not even be able to know if these exist.\n- Ugly as hell - the last thing users want is to see is a ton of `.dirs` when they start the notebook in their home directory. Obviously this point only applies to the dashboard listing.\n- The usage case of having notebooks in hidden directories or with `.` file names is extremely unusual.\n\nIn this context, I consider 4 to be a bug.\n\nThe only situation where I would consider allowing the editing of hidden files is using an explicit whitelist of files that you can enter a hand typed URL to edit.\n"

    "body": "Hello!\nFirst off deepest apologies if I, as a non-ipython developer, am commenting in a inappropriate place.\n\nI am very confused by this decision. I am somewhat new to ipython use but I am already finding it incredibly useful as a system shell. It gives me a contextual history, being JSON it is great for a git repo, and allows for notes about historical shell command/config choices ( other benefits too, of course ).\n\nBut this decision makes it very difficult and awkward to use it to centralize concepts related to program configs. Currently I am simply making symlinks to my `hidden` dirs so that the notebook server will serve them.  For example, I document and/or make my ipython config changes in a ipynb file at $HOME/.ipython/ipythonNotes.ipynb.  I also have various other config set-ups in, of course, hidden  directories.  I would like, ideally, to be able to just have a parent ipynb in $HOME that markdown links to all those  other ipynb's. This can be done now, but only by doing stuff like '!ln -s .ipython sillyIpythonLinkDir`. then (foo)[sillyIpythonLinkDir/myNB.ipynb]\n\nAs mentioned above -- if someone has access to your ipython notebook running in home as you they can do anything they want anyway so why limit the hidden files?\n\nI do understand ellisonbg's message but isn't that my responsibility to not open up my home dir, not my software's?  I also do not understand why not to run it in home unless you are in an environment where when your machine opens a port that port is then WAN visible -- in my experience that is very very rare. \n\nWith all that, it seems to me that this should be an option that defaults to off. \n\nThanks, and again please forgive me if posting in the wrong place; I did go to IRC first.\nAlso, I am totally open to argument if I am being foolish here: wouldn't be the first time.\n"
