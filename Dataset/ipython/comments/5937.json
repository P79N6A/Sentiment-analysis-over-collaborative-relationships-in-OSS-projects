For now we decided to limit this only to the description.\n- Adding full Markdown+LaTeX support to descriptions. Right now descriptions are adding using jQuery's `$.text` so there are no security issues. If we move to using Markdown, we have to use `$.html` and there are security issues that come into play for static and persistent widgets. For now, this doesn't make sense to create new vulnerabilities.\n\nIn summar, I think this looks good and accomplishes what it set out to do, merging.\n"
