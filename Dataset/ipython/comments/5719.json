Link it cross profile (easy) , or use the fact that config file are pure python to read secret from another file with the help of  following config options:\n\n```\n$ ipython notebook --help-all\n...\nNotebookNotary options\n----------------------\n--NotebookNotary.algorithm=<Enum>\n    Default: 'sha256'\n    Choices: {'sha224', 'sha256', 'sha384', 'md5', 'sha1', 'sha512'}\n    The hashing algorithm used to sign notebooks.\n--NotebookNotary.secret=<Bytes>\n    Default: b''\n    The secret key with which notebooks are signed.\n--NotebookNotary.secret_file=<Unicode>\n    Default: ''\n    The file where the secret key is stored.\n```\n\n[edit] Apparently you can even set the file secret with `NotebookNotary.secret_file` but it seem it does not `expanduser` (yet) might me a good PR maybe.[/edit] \n"
