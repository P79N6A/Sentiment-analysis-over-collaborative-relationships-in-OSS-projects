    "body": "@minrk, now that we have at least [a reasonable example](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/config/ipython.html#example), do you think it's enough, or should we keep this open?  I know we don't really have a fully detailed transition guide, but I'm also not really sure we'll be able to justify the time and effort of writing one...\n\nThe only thing I really see missing is any mention of the new `startup/` directory, and perhaps updating the docs a bit to point to that example section right at the start, so new users don't get thrown into the architectural discussion immediately.\n\nBasically I think that we can close this one once we:\n- reorder the config docs to start with the easy example part and leave the conceptual/architecture discussion for second\n- mention the startup directory\n- perhaps add a few more non-trivial pieces to the little example file, such as defining a custom magic.\n\nWould you guys agree?  If so, that's doable quickly.  I just want to have an _achievable_ metric for this issue, rather than something so lofty that we may just not get to it...\n"
