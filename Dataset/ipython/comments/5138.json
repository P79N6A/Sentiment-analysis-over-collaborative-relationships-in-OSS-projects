It does not seem like the scheduler or the hub are doing that, so I guess it's the session object or zmq itself. I'm completely unfamiliar with ipython architecture.

So it seems that it's not a library version/OS-specific issue.\n\nEDIT:\nPerhaps it's useful to mention that it does not seem to be a throughput problem, so much as the problem with the number of messages being sent. I can't reproduce #4872 (no significant memory usage growth), but if I change the example from #4872 as:\n\n```\na = numpy.random.rand(1000)\nresult = lv.map_sync(big_input, [a] * 50000)\n```\n\nThen I see a jump in memory usage to Â±700MB, irrespective of the fact that the amount of data sent through stayed the same (if we forget about the message overhead).\n"

The memory consumption is steadily increasing with no end when I'm running your example with ipython 3.1.0, pytzmq 14.4.1 and libzmq 4.0.4+dfsg-2. I cannot run any computations with many tasks because of the growing size of the controller memory consumption. The result/metadata dictionaries are not the culprit. The memory is going somewhere else...\n"

    "body": "I'm experiencing this also with pyzmq 14.6.0, libzmq1 2.1.11-1ubuntu1 and ipython 3.1.0 on Ubuntu 12.04. \n\nA bigger problem in my case is growth of the ipython parallel client in my python 2.7 kernel. I know that it's the client as the memory is freed if I create a new client (allowing the old one to be garbage collected). An apparent by-product of memory usage is a substantial slowdown in execution time (looks like the client and/or controller are spending many cpu cycles doing house keeping).\n\n@peter-ch do you know what fixed it for you?\n\n@minrk  perhaps we should reopen this issue, at least until we can determine a/some cause/s. Perhaps the client memory leak is a separate issue?\n\nI'll provide some memory profile info from heapy on the client shortly (heapy takes a while with large memory usage!).\n\nps: my workaround is to re-instantiate the client and re-launch the ipython parallel cluster from time to time. \n"
