So most of the time issues are fixed if someone is willing to put some elbow grease and provide a patch.\r\n\r\nIf really this is blocking and you need payed support, you can talk to companies like Anaconda, which do have developers with the right resources, and generally upstream the patches once they have a fix.\r\n\r\nIt seem like in MinTTY `VIRTUAL_ENV` point to a non existing dir, that mean we'll need to figure out why, and what's the good behavior.\r\n\r\nMaybe just catch `FileNotFoundError` and exit the function without doing anything ? But that may be just a footgun.\r\n\r\nIf you are unfamiliar with github/pull-request but can even just modify your local copy in a way that works and tell us how, that would be usefull. \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"
