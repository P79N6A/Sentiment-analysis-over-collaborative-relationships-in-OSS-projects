    "body": "Thomas, Min\n\nThanks for taking a look at this.\n\nThe link below is a good introduction to some of the issues. In the longer term it is definitely the case that JATS may no be a long term solution and HTML5 with a core tagset is definitely gaining traction conceptually.\n\nAt the moment however JATS is the de facto default format for most biomedical publishers including PLOS. I need to pin down exactly what schema we use as our back end XML format but it will be a version of JATS. What I would hope to do is demonstrate that a system, like IPyNB, conceived as an authoring environment that people are actually using, can generate XML that could go into our production systems. \n\nThe concept was based on the notion that it would be _relatively_ easy to implement pushing out the JATS XML. So if its a major hassle then it may not be worth it. But the tactical concept is to demonstrate that systems exist today that could push directly to our production servers in principle as a way of starting the conversation about what the exchange formats of the future should look like.\n\nCheers\n\nCameron\n\nOn 29 Aug 2013, at 23:36, Thomas Kluyver notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> The link Min posted in Hipchat earlier is actually a critique saying that it makes more sense to store the text of papers in HTML rather than JATS XML: http://blogs.plos.org/tech/structured-documents-for-science-jats-xml-as-canonical-content-format/\n> \n> â€”\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n"
