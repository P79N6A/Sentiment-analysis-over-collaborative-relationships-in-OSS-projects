So I'll revert the changes related to relative imports in this request once I push that out.  \n\nI had one other issue to look at related to compiler defaults.  \n\nNOTE: iPython would still need to run against my branch of Jython, but I'll issue the pull request there and maybe they'll pick it up.  Unfortunately, the changes to Jython involved downgrading jline and issues related to jline were an area of focus for those guys.  I suspect there will be some additional effort on that end before this entire subject can be resolved.  \n\nThanks for your patience.  I can make some progress this weekend.\n"

    "body": "I'm very excited about this, and plan to work with ghjc to see what we could to ensure that changes in Jython are promptly made. Currently my only concern is we should do this in the context of a planned upgrade to JLine2 as Jython's standard console.\n\nLooking at the commits, let me suggest that any dispatching on running on Jython should use the platform module; specifically `platform.python_implementation()`, which is `\"Jython\"`.\n\nI am also interested in the possibility of fixing the os.name bug in Jython so that it actually reports the correct OS, instead of having to use the nonstandard `os._name`. In looking at the code here, I don't know what `os._name` would report for windows, vs `getProperty('os.name')` from `java.lang.System`, but it should be whatever cpython would report. Apparently someone did this research: http://stackoverflow.com/a/2336254\n"

Just thought I'd post a note here letting you know that I am working on similar goals (allowing IPython to be useful with other Python implementations). #5055 makes minimal changes to import IPython from IronPython. BTW, IronPython uses the following:\n\n```\nimport os, sys\nos.name, sys.platform\n('posix', 'cli')\n```\n\nwhen running on Linux or Mac, and `os.name == 'nt'` (I believe) when under any Windows. It would be good if we could get Jython and IronPython to have a consistent method of identification. \n"

It really never should be put into Jython because it was not complete/does not really work, and I don't expect we will see it being finished. We are moving to cffi and C extension API support instead, although slowly.\n\n@ghjc Jython standalone has some issues. I plan to look at this after beta 3.

    "body": "@jimbaker Great to hear from you.  This version of jython: https://bitbucket.org/bbjc/jython seems to fix relative imports (at least in this case).  Removing ctypes will help get this working also.  I'm not sure I follow what you are thinking with os._name.\n\nThe big issue identified by @takluyver was what to do with pexpect.  I agree that letting it load in a half broken state is not a good thing.  IPython needs the parts of it that do work.  So maybe something jython environment enabled that provides the required functionality will need to be devised.  I never had a chance to come up with a good answer for that.  \n\nProbably the next big thing after that to get working is command history.  That requires SQLite.  I have some ideas, but maybe JyNI could be used.  Also on the todo list is cleaning up how IPython locates some the files it uses.  I'm seeing a _ipython directory in my home directory which should probably be ._ipython or something.\n\nThere is a fair amount to be done.  I'd like to coordinate efforts and contribute as best as I can.  \n"
