    "body": "An ideal situation would be to use argparse for everything, since we could do pretty clever things with types, nargs, etc. building a parser from traitlets. But since we must generate the parser at launch, the construction would probably add a great deal to the startup time, which would be pretty rough.\n\nWith this as it is, I think the only thing we get is allowing spaces between name and value :)\n"
