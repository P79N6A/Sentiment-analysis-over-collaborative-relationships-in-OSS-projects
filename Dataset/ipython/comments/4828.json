It would require us to create \"names\" for each action. But even that is bound to fail as people customize things as they can make subtle changes to how actions happen. In other words, our \"actions\" are not simple atomic things, they are complete JavaScript functions that make arbitrary calls to our API. Not sure what we want to do with this.\n"
