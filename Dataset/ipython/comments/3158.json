    "body": "I think I get the logic behind firing every 10x the duration of the save (if it takes more than 3s), but feel it could do with a moments discussion... It might be good to put an upper limit on the time between saves - perhaps 5 minutes??\n\nIf for some bizarre reason, a particular save takes, say, 20s, then it'll be 3 mins 20secs before the next one. This can happen for example when the users client computer has a process that temporarily fills up it's memory, or perhaps the connection gets clogged by a flatmate downloading something huge or a cafe enforcing a rate limit.\n\nIn such cases, it makes sense to reduce the load of autosaves on resources. However the flipside is that the user may be surprised that the notebook wasn't saved. The 20s -> 3mins20secs is perhaps ok, but what if a save takes a reallly long time, say 3 minutes? \n\nThe situations in which I can imagine a save taking a long time:\n- very laggy connection \n- huge notebook\n- very laggy client computer \n- very laggy server \n"

I would say that it's the right decision in an extremely low bandwidth case to have quite infrequent saves - even as infrequent as half an hour, if it really does take three minutes (most likely on a weak cellular connection or similar).  The user is informed when the autosave frequency changes, so they will see \"autosaving every 1800s\" in the notification area if a save takes three minutes, and the 'last saved' area still has the last saved time stamp, etc.\n"

    "body": "Yep, fair enough. And the user can always elect to manually save if they see that auto-saves are far apart. Does it detect how long the most recent save took? Or is it the most recent auto-save? My thinking is a situation where a save is unusually slow for a temporary reason - if the user does a manual save a little later that is quick, perhaps the autosave machinery should notice.\n\nAs a matter of interest, is the notebook sent to the server as some sort of diff or as full text? I'm guessing full text. (I guess I'm thinking of google docs again - I believe they have a clever engine for that - I wonder if it can be borrowed?)\n"

The biggest thing on the JS side of the code is that we are slowly getting more save/checkpoint related code spreadout over the notebook object and the savewidget.  I would prefer to have a single object that wraps the notebooks/checkpoints web services and provides a clean JS API for talking to them that notebook (and other apps) can use.  I think the name \"savewidget\" is the wrong name for this object, but maybe lets see if we can clean this up a bit...\n"

    "body": "My only concern at this point is purely cosmetic: with so much infromation printed about the checkpoint/save times, it doesn't take a very long notebook title before all that rolls over in a pretty ugly way:\n\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/57394/451923/db114754-b2c2-11e2-8011-b60fe5456582.png)\n\nBut improving this would really require rethinking the layout of the UI deeper.  I think we'll need to do that, but I don't think it's wise to hold this important and complex PR any further just on that. Thoughts?\n"

    "body": "It will be shorter when the dirty event is introduced, at which point the 'autosaved: DATE' will simply be `autosaved` or `unsaved changes`, depending on whether the current view of the file is in sync with the autosaved version, but not short enough to really alleviate the problem.  It won't solve the real issue of the fact that the save widget as it is now is just much too wide (and this PR makes it wider).  I think revisiting how the save widget looks is definitely something we have to do, but I think it can be separate.\n"
