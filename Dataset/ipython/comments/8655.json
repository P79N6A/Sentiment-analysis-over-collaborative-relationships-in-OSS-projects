    "body": "That is actually a global import, of [path.py](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/path.py). However, it is broken under Python 2, because it tries to do an implicit local import from `IPython.utils.path` instead, which fails.\n\nWe should use `from __future__ import absolute_imports` at the top of that file to fix it. Do you want to make a PR doing that? If you could also add a test that would have caught the problem (in `IPython.utils.tests.test_text`), that would be great.\n"
