    "body": "Sorry, I had a spelling mistake `__main__`. I changed this mistake and get my result. \r\n\r\nThat is to say, in the IPython session environment, all files can be executed as a script by the `%run` command, and the variables in the file will then be imported into the current namespace. That is, for a module file, the effect that I use `%run` commands to this file  is the same as `from module import *` unless the file defines  main function (`if __name__  == '__main__': `), and the main function will be executed in this case.\r\n\r\nOK, may be I understand that. Thank you for your help."
