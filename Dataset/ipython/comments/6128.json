    "body": "I completely agree that some widgets will need to do smart syncing. The way\nI have envisioned that is that there will be done through the custom\nmessage API on a per widget basis. This type of logic is very special case.\nBut I think it is important to keep the regular `sync=True` traits fully\nstateful and not incremental. Thus, if you want to build a full blown\nspreadsheet widget, the spreadsheet data would probably not be handled\nthrough `sync=True` attributes. The only sane way of doing that in a fully\nstateful way is to make each piece of state a separate attribute or\nsubwidget. But that is crazy compared to just passing messages when the\nnumber of states gets high. This is why I am still a bit hesitant about\nallowing custom JSON handling for container types like numpy arrays, etc. I\ndon't think things like that should _ever_ be treated as a big state blob\nsent in one shot using the automatic synching.\n\nOn Tue, Jul 15, 2014 at 10:27 PM, Jason Grout notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> At some point, on some level, I think we are going to have to address the\n> issue that we don't need to transfer large amounts of data to sync small\n> changes if we are going to scale the amount of data a widget can handle.
