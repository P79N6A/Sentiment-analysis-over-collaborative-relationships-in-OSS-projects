This triggered the patch_stdout code. Actually, there was no need to go through the effort of erasing the prompt, and drawing it again, just for printing an empty string. (I still have to check why this is actually happening.) \r\n\r\n- The real fix is to wait for CPR responses before rendering the captured content. CPR works asynchronously. We ask for the cursor position by writing something to stdout, and we receive the response from the terminal on stdin. There is always a little delay. But it's important to keep the terminal in RAW mode and read this input until this response arrives. We didn't do that, and it rendered the terminal's own response with the cursor position.\r\n\r\nThe timing should have been slightly different between terminals, but I guess this should do it.\r\n\r\nCould you all try with the latest prompt_toolkit commit? If it works, I'll push a new release."
