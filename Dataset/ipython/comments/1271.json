    "body": "Indeed, this is related to #289 (colors should be implemented in the frontend).  The %colors magic executes exclusively in the kernel, and does not affect the frontend.  You should see that tracebacks, etc. are in fact not colored after you make this call.  Essentially, the zmq console has the exact same problem as the qtconsole and notebook wrt colors, which is perfectly logical, but the expectations may be different because it _looks_ more like terminal IPython, despite behaving more like the qtconsole.\n"

    "body": "Mmh, we should think about formalizing how kernels send messages related to prompts to frontends: certain frontends may choose to ignore such information, but at least we should have a clean specification for the whole prompt handling situation.  For example, for the notebook I don't think prompts are ever going to change, but the console could at least honor the `>>>` change, and perhaps even more dynamic ones.\n"
