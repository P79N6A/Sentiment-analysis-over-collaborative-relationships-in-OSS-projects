    "body": "Well, since this is in the main(argv) part of the code, not in the library part, I do think that a print (though it should go to sys.stderr and not to stdout) makes sense: it is shown at the user's system command-line, where I think that human error messages are better than tracebacks.\n\nMy thought on this is in general:\n- code called inside libraries always raises, never prints errors.\n- code meant to be called as a system command (possibly by a user who doesn't even know python or what a traceback is) should turn the exception into a more human-friendly, language-indepenedent error message.\n\nThis means that the application's main() is about the _only_ part that should be doing this, but in this case that's what is happening so I think that's OK.\n\nHow does that sound, Brian?\n\nIn summary, I'm OK with the approach, but it should:\n- print to stderr, not stdout.\n- exit via sys.exit(1) which appropriately sets the exit status as a failure, not return.\n\nIf those changes are made I have no problem; Brian how does that sound?\n"
