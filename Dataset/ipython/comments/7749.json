    "body": "The way matplotlib inline figures works is really specific to matplotlib and IPython where we have some specific hook to render things inline. I don't know if/wether it can work across the Python-Julia fence, put it's probably a non-trivial piece of work. Having matplotlib patched to without IPython having knowledge of matplotlib would be great, and would probably simplify the things. \n\nOn pure julia kernels, when the object returned is a Fig Object you can always a hook that gets its PNG repr and display it using the standard julia `show(::mime, object)` way.\n"
