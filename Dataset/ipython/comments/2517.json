Just a note, we have identical versions of Chrome and OS, and neither David or I saw the issue you mentioned.  Are you working from a locally installed MathJax?  Did you, ahem, clear your cache?  I think it's worth reverting the code for now anyway, and there are definitely problems I'd like to pester Davide Cervone about.\n"

    "body": "@ketch @ellisonbg - I found and fixed a couple mistakes I had made with regard to development, and I backed out the equation numbers/references.  Please pull this branch and test it.  Please also test with your internet connection turned off (with/without a local mathjax copy).  Offline --no-mathjax notebooks are currently **broken** in master (sorry!).\n\n## Side note about re-enabling equation numbers/references\n\n@ketch - if you'd like to turn equation numbers/references on, the following seems to work for me:\n\nModify the `IPython/frontend/html/notebook/static/js/mathjaxutils.js` file like this to turn on equation numbers/references in the MathJax configuration by adding the line starting with TeX.  You'll also notice that you can center your equations here if you'd prefer :)\n\n```\n    MathJax.Hub.Config({\n        TeX: { equationNumbers: { autoNumber: \"AMS\", useLabelIds: true } },\n        tex2jax: {\n            inlineMath: [ ['$','$'], [\"\\\\(\",\"\\\\)\"] ],\n            displayMath: [ ['$$','$$'], [\"\\\\[\",\"\\\\]\"] ],\n            processEnvironments: true\n        },\n        displayAlign: 'left', // Change this to 'center' to center equations.\n        \"HTML-CSS\": {\n            styles: {'.MathJax_Display': {\"margin\": 0}}\n        }\n        });\n```\n\nEquation numbers/references will have a decent chance at getting rendered correctly, just remember to throw equations in align or equation environments (the MathJax examples uses a few shortcuts) if you want to attach references to them.  If things start to render improperly, _save_ the notebook, then reload it manually with your browser, and everything should render correctly.  This is very beta functionality, but I know you're willing to deal with the annoyance of a browser refresh now and then for nicer typesetting.  I'm interested in seeing how you are using equation numbers/references so I can plan around your use cases for future development on this code.\n"

    "body": "@ellisonbg - Thanks for the detailed code review.  I'm pushing changes according to your suggestions, so I will respond to your comments in summary form below.\n\n### `Cell.prototype.typeset` - Why the move to `TextCell`?  Is it safe to call this function without the markup fixes?\n\nThe move to `TextCell` was motivated by trying to trace the rendered div in the DOM.  I don't need to do this anymore, so I restored the `typeset` functionality back to the `Cell` class.  As for markup fixes, these are only needed for cells that use the Markdown parser.  You'll notice that the `typeset` call in the `Markdown.prototype.render` function is performed after all the math-wrangling trickery.\n\n### Moving the MathJax configuration to the static .html files\n\nWhen I was trying to figure out why equation referencing was subtly broken, I assumed part of the problem was that I wasn't ensuring that MathJax was being loaded early enough (the documentation suggests including MathJax in this way, but it is not mandatory).  It turns out that the difference is actually between using:\n\n`{{mathjax_url}}?config=TeX-AMS_HTML` and \n`{{mathjax_url}}?config=TeX-AMS_HTML-full`\n\nAccording to the [MathJax documentation](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html#inline-config), we shouldn't configure after MathJax is loaded unless we use the `&delayStartupUntil=configured` parameter and later call `MathJax.Hub.Configured()`.  This was working for me anyway in Chrome, but I suspect there are other browsers where this might be a problem.  I've moved the configuration from the .html files back to the .js and I have added the delayStartup parameter for correctness.\n\nI've also rewritten my comment above to reflect the file to modify to enable equation numbering/references.\n\n### Renaming `HUB` to `hub`\n\nDone.\n\n### Vestigial comment about id\n\nRemoved.\n"
