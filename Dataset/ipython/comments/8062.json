It is not clear to me whether raw HTML output (e.g. iframes) be restricted, or left alone. Perhaps a combination of this and #7718 should be used.\n\nFor the moment, I'm inclined to only confine images. The reason being that we already have the double-click to expand behavior on images (I only changed slightly what expand means in this PR), but not on the output area as a whole. That means that right now, there's an easy way to expand larger images to their native size, but not an easy way to expand other HTML elements. Perhaps we should go that way ultimately, but I like to take these things one step at a time.\n\n@takluyver thanks for pointing that out, yes calc should fix it in the latest commit. I thought it was behaving correctly because of my custom css changes the right margin. I should really remember to test CSS PRs without custom CSS.\n"

However, I think it is better to clean that part of the markup to make it more consistent and allow for a more definitive solution. For example, even relatively simple HTML will overflow (in the example below, a table):\n\n![screenshot from 2015-03-18 17 29 21](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/599274/6721600/8d3cb8e4-cd94-11e4-9769-12bb523b4c65.png)\n\n@minrk I think the double click (and single click) behavior is working correctly in other HTML elements (actually, in the case of a table, the double click works but single click has no effect.) The main problem are not the parent elements. The problem is that the HTML tags that are injected need to have proper styling to fit their parents.\n"

Steps:\n1. Start your browser maximized and add a large image.\n2. Resize your browser:\n\n![screenshot from 2015-03-19 12 14 20](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/599274/6737492/8d7b0db8-ce31-11e4-9bd6-804b68e45c91.png)\n\n3 . Double click on the image to expand it.\n4 . Maximize your browser (now the image is overflowing):\n\n![screenshot from 2015-03-19 12 16 42](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/599274/6737543/de6b8cfc-ce31-11e4-9310-abc6a04b70ae.png)\n\n5 .

When you switch the output to scrollboxed and back, that doesn't change the image size, so if the image was overflowing before, switching the output area state twice will bring it back to overflowing.\n\nI do see another problem, though. When resizing the window with the image constrained to max width, its size doesn't update as the notebook width updates. I can make it resize in width if I set `max-width: 100%` on the div containing the img (`class=\"ui-wrapper ui-resizable-autohide\"`), but then the aspect ratio isn't preserved.\n"

    "body": "Yes, I see what you mean. I think I find confusing the feature of expanding the image outside the notebook. There is also the case in which the output is scrollboxed and you double-click to expand within the scrollbox. I think that is very reasonable. Although the image doesn't seem to preserve its dimensions, it seems like a middle ground between the expanded image and the scrollboxed image. By the way, what is the purpose of allowing the image to increase to its original size?\n\nThe problem you described is the same I was mentioning before, right?

(the other part was that it wasn't consistent across browsers, which I think we've fixed here)\n"
