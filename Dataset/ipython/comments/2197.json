    "body": "This may be related to this issue: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/1270 as it looks like selection primary doesn't have a focus (if something like that is possible) and when I right click on selection, it gets focus.\n\nIt's also not intuitive to have this gray colored selection, so I'll repeat the same differently: if I make selection in qtconsole help window, selection background is gray and text is white. Then if I right click on same selection, background stays the same but text is now black (I assume it's in focus).\n\nSo perhaps is same focus issue\n\nEdit: or perhaps it's different after I re-read previous issue\n"

    "body": "Hi, \n\nThe qtconsole has been moved to https://github.com/jupyter/qtconsole, and this issue had no activity for quite some time. If this is still relevant I would suggest this issue to be reopen on the above cited repository. \n\nThis will allow us to keep the number of IPython issues smaller and focussed on IPython. As currently there is an extremely high number of opened issues , it make it really hard to find if a problem is actually known, or going to be worked one. \n\nFeel free to reopen if need, for the time being I'm going to close this. \n\nThanks.\n"
