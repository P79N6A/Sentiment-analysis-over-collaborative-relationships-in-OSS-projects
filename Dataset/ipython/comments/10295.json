    "body": "Hi there, \r\n\r\nThanks for your bug report. IPython 2.1 was released mid 2014, and further version of the 2.x branch (up to 2.4) containing bugfixes were released as well. So I would suggest trying at least these new-er version.\r\n\r\nIPython (and now Jupyter) have had major upgrade since then, the notebook is currently in version 4.x and IPython in version 5.x versions older than that are not supported and don't get bugfixes. If it's a bug on our side it has either already been fixed in more recent versions (likely), or we'll be happy to fix it if it can be reproduced on more recent versions.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I would try to nuke sql files that should be in your `~/.ipython` directory, I'm unsure which one(s) as this version of the codebase is about 3 years old.  (or nuke everything except your config files)\r\n\r\nHope that will help. "

I would definitely recommend upgrading, though."
