    "body": "This looks great, many thanks!  The fixes and cleanups/modernizations are excellent.\n\nI have a few minor notes that I made inline, once those addressed the only other overall concern that I have is whether you could add a couple of small tests.  We're trying to be good about adding new (even fairly trivial ones are better than nothing) tests as we retrofit/fix old code.  Though I admit that writing a good test for something that depends so much on actual line numbers (like calls to %macro) is tricky... But if you can come up with one, that would be great. If not, no big deal, the code is already a major improvement.\n"

I suggested to Satra in India we simplify things out by getting rid of the fancy InputList class, looking for a codebase with less custom objects everywhere.

It was really just a simple list subclass with the string joining semantics upon slicing, so bringing it back would be very easy...\n\nI'm totally open to ideas on this front, and sorry if some of the early changes had unintended consequences.\n"
