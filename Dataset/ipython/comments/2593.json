    "body": "Hi, \nI'm not sure it is worth adding by default as notebook might be on remote machine then it does not make sens.\nAnd my guess is that not many user does open qtconsole from notebook.\n\nHopefully it should be pretty easy to configure, even if it is not documented (yet).\n\nWould this suite you ?\n\nadd the following to your `.ipython/profile_xxx/static/js/custom.js` to create a 'open qtconsole' toolbar button.\n\n``` javascript\n$([IPython.events]).on('notebook_loaded.Notebook', function(){\n    IPython.toolbar.add_buttons_group([\n                {   \n                'label'   : 'run qtconsole',\n                'icon'    : 'ui-icon-calculator', // select your icon from http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/\n                'callback': function(){IPython.notebook.kernel.execute('%qtconsole')}\n                } \n                // add more button here if needed.\n            ]); \n});\n```\n\nAdding a menu entry will be slightly more longer but not complicated, I leave it to the reader as an exercise if he wish to do it. Fell free to ask if you get stuck.\n"
