    "body": "The Qt console is designed to be embeddable in other applications, but not via the classes you are considering.  The class of interest for you is `RichIPythonWidget`, which provides the basic console frontend without any coupling to IPython's application layer. Your application would then be responsible for launching kernel(s), placing the widget in a tab group or other layout container, etc. \n\nOn the other hand, the main window class is indeed quite coupled to the IPython qtconsole application, but it was never intended to be used outside of IPython and we are not, as far as I know, making any promises about its API being stable across versions. The functionality provided by the main window class is quite specific and is not appropriate for many embedding use cases. Of course, you may find it a useful starting point for building your own application.\n\nAs far as tests go, some components of the Qt console have unit tests but generally the coverage is poor. This is largely due to the fact that many components of the console are difficult to test, but there is definitely room for improvement here.\n"
