    "body": "Hi @takluyver and thanks for your comment! Indeed I jumped the gun with this PR, sorry.\n\nI made a bit more research into standard `tokenize` module and found that it is used in a strange way in IPython `TokenInputTransformer` class.\n\nStandard `tokenize` module expects that `readline` callable passed into `tokenize` or `generate_tokens` returns data line by line, just like `readline` method of standard `file` object. In this case `\\n` symbol can not exist in returned line, so it is not added to the regexps.\n\nBut `TokenInputTransformer.get_line` method (that is passed to `generate_tokens`) returns all data in one line (separated with `\\n`) on first call and throws `TokenError` exception on further calls. I don't completely understand reasons of this tricky logic yet, but I think it should be changed and `tokenize` module should be used properly.\n\nSo how do you think? Am I on a right way? I could continue research, add a couple of tests and rewrite `TokenInputTransformer`, if this is ok with you. :)\n\nThanks and sorry for delay.\n"
