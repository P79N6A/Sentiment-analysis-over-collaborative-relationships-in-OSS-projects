It doesn't do anything other than allow text, so why not just make it a text field with browser's default spelling checker? Then one can switch back and forth (from code/markdown to Raw) to do spell check.\n\n2) It appears that CodeMirror is responsible for the live typing format of markdown cells. Add typo.js (or something) per stack overflow question above.\n\n3) Markdown live typing formatting doesn't add that much (formats strings, lists, and ...?) Why not just make the Markdown cells be text fields (much like this comment box on GitHub)?\n"

To implement the UK dictionary in an Anaconda IPython 3 installation  on Windows:\n1.  Download the two files `en-GB.aff` and `en-GB.dic` into the (new) folder `C:\\Anaconda\\share\\jupyter\\nbextensions\\typo\\dictionaries\\en_GB\\`.  \n2.  Rename the two files to use underscore instead of dash/hyphen (look at the en_US equivalent).  Change `en-GB.aff` to `en_GB.aff` and change `en-GB.dic` to `en_GB.dic`.\n3. Edit the file `C:\\Anaconda\\share\\jupyter\\nbextensions\\calico-spell-check.js` to replace `var lang = \"en_US\";` with `var lang = \"en_GB\";`.\n\nIt should be a simple matter to find the equivalent directories in Linux.\n"
