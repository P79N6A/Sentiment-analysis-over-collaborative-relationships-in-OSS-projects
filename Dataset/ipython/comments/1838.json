I'd be OK with removing externals that are only used in quarantine/deathrow, but I'd want to add a quick comment in the user file to the effect of:\n\nThis depends on foo.bar that used to be in externals, if this code is updated to run again with current IPython, you may need to reintroduce that file back.  In doing so, look for the possibility of achieving the same effect only with the standard library (which may have improved by now, since we currently depend on Python 2.6).\n"
