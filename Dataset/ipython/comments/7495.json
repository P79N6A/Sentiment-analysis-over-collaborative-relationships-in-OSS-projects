    "body": "We try to push as much as possible functionality outside of core IPython. We will even split the widget into its own repo soon after the release of IPython 3.0. So widget are limited (by design) to really minimal expressions. \n\nSo I doubt something like that will ever be in core, and we encourage you and everyone else to developp library that rely on widgets, and provide higher-level abstraction. \n"

    "body": "Widgets already work on non-python kernels, Julia use them extensively, at least for the JS side. \nI don't know how things work in Julia with PyCall.\n\nThe repo-split will mostly put widget in a separate repo. I guess we will have a shim that raise a warning with  `import IPython.html.widgets` that the import have been moved. \n\nI don't know (yet) if widgets package will be a requirement for installing Jupyter-notebook. I guess it will in a first iteration at least. It will mostly allow users to decide not to install it. Install it without Jupyter and/or without IPython-kernel.\nIt will most likely remove the 1 to 1 mapping between widgets version and IPython version. \n\nThe widget repo will be on it's own release schedule, which mean that if you start contributing most of the code, and the consensus between the main contributors is to release every 5 weeks, the repo will be free to do so. Same for contents of repository, if the maintainers assume a pink fluffy unicorn slider is a must have, then pink-fluffy-unicorn will be.\n\nThis will most likely allow people not using the widgets lots, to not follow the repo, \n(I will probably do that not that I don't like it, but I have almost 0 knowledge of the code there)\npeople interested, not be flooded by unrelated issues, and permit a much more easier\nentering as contributor; \n\nI think the consensus would likely put Jason Grout and Sylvain Corlay as Co-Maintainer of Widgets with Jon Frederic. And seeing your knowledge and work on it, I wouldn't oppose on having you (Cyrille) as\ncommiter on widgets.\n\nDoes that answer some of your questions ?\nIf you have more comment or suggestions, please let us know.\n"
