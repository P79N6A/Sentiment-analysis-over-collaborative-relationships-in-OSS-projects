Some people in that thread describe this as soft-failure, where no plot is produced when expected.   On headless systems without X11 this is a fatal error - the kernel just dies.  Users without access to the server logs will be completely mystified by this fatal error.\n\nTo make the situation even more frustrating, the `--matplotlib` option is not available on the `jupyter notebook` command line, and as far as I can tell there isn't an option for overriding this behavior in  `~/.jupyter/jupiter_notebook_config.py`  So instead of getting better, it feels like the situation has actually gotten worse.\n\nThis has been discussed to death.    Overriding module loading to detect when matplotlib module was loaded the first time seems like a robust solution.  It would be nice see one of the proposed solutions adopted, even if it isn't perfect.  \n\n[BTW this issue should probably be merged with  ipython#6424 ]\n"
