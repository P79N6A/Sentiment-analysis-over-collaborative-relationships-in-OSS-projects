    "body": "Ok, there is a misunderstanding/miscodding about the _construction_ location and the _call_ location.\r\nThe current code make assumptions and document as if construction and call where always done next to each other as it was _mostly_ done to use with the `embed()` function.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to fix (split the functionality into kill-instance and kill-location) I think kill-location is what people want. But I'll rethink that tomorrow.\r\n\r\nNote for myself (i'm pretty sure I'll understand myself tomorrow) as it's fresh in my brain:\r\n  - [x] Killing location in init does not make sens as you can just store variable on self, but you still kinda-need it for loop that recreate instances.\r\n  - [x] Tomorrow you should be smart enough to figure out is the kill-call-locations and kill-instance-locations can be shared in the same list.\r\n  - [x] Yes it make sens to split the kill-instance and kill-location cause you might want to put the same instance in multiple place.\r\n  -  [x] Use this opportunity to implement a kill&exit.\r\n  - [x] Document why or deprecate empty init_sys_module."
