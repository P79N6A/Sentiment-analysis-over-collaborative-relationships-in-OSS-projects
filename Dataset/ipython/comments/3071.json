The fact that `%drun` works on statements makes it very clear to me that it should _not_ have `run` anywhere in the name, because `run` really means running files in IPython.\n\nSo if we are extending `%debug`, we would get things like:\n\n``` python\n# old behavior\n%debug \n# debug a statement:\n%debug my_statement()\n# debug a cell:\n%%debug\ndef foo():\n    1/0\nfoo()\n```\n\nThat doesn't seem too confusing to me, as it strictly adds functionality and doesn't change anything, right?  It also seems fairly clear, as the sentence structure of `debug statement` actually describes what is going to happen.  If anything, I think `%debug` is a better name for this new functionality than what it does currently.\n"

    "body": "I've been thinking about this quite a bit, and I think it's a good time to rationalize things out in the code execution magics department.  Since running code is more or less the heart of ipython, we should do our best to have a clean and consistent api here.\n\nI mostly concur with @minrk in the idea that `run` is for scripts, the others for code blocks; this wasn't really by explicit design but rather as an accident of history, but we might as well run with it as it lets us present a consistent message.\n\nThe rationale for what comes below: `%run` takes special flags for three things: timing, profiling and debugging.  And we also several dedicated magics for those things.  We should harmonize all this with cleaner names and an easy to understand mapping between `%run` and the dedicated functions, where the only difference is that `%run` applies to scripts/modules and the others are for local blocks (line/cell).\n\nSo here's what I think we should do:\n- Rename `%profile` to `%active_profile` or similar (`current`?).  The word 'profile' is just too important to leave it to this slightly obscure use case.\n- Unify the proposed `%drun` with `%debug` as indicated above. Plain `%debug` would continue to work as today, but with arguments it would be used to debug simple statements or whole blocks (in cell  magic mode).\n- Rename `%prun` to `%profile`, leaving `%prun` to just raise a `UsageError` about the renaming.\n- Unify `%time` and `%timeit` into a single function, named `%time`, that does effectively what `%timeit` does today.  The simplistic behavior that `%time` has would be obtained with a `-s` flag or similar.  There really shouldn't be _two_ timing functions.\n- While we do this, the timing ones should grown an option to return the timing value(s) in seconds.  I can't count the number of times I've needed this to automate timing comparisons.\n\nIn practice this plan really should be odne in separate PRs, one per topic (timing, profiling, debugging).  I just wanted to lay out the plan here for feedback.  Once we agree, this PR can focus on debugging and hopefully two more will come for profiling and timing.\n\nHow does this sound?\n"

It lets us keep the mental model of \" `run` for scripts, explicit commands for code blocks\".  Which I think happens to also work visually quite well, because `%run` tends to be more used in the terminal/console/qtconsole,  whereas the individual commands for multiline blocks are more of a notebook thing, and by being explicit words, they make for more readable notebooks in the long run.\n\n@jstenar, does that seem reasonable?\n"

Concise once you know it, but not especially obvious to newcomers.\n- There are separate %time[it], %prun (to become %profile?) and proposed %drun magics for using code inline. %prun and %drun are rather non-obvious.\n\nAnother possibility might be to introduce -f (file) flags to the execution magic commands, so you could do things like:\n\n```\n# Code inline\n%profile do_something(x, y)\n\n# Code from file\n%profile -f script.py\n```\n"

    "body": "I'm -1 on `%exe`: I think `%run` is fairly close to common language usage and also has a long tradition in IPython, so it should stay as-is, but for timing/profiling/debugging of chunks of code, especially in the notebook, I much prefer clear and descriptive terms like `%time` or `%debug` to having notebook cells tagged with `%exe -t`, which is fairly cryptic.\n\nKeep in mind that `%run` is mostly used at the terminal clients (including qt console), so it's more transient.  But tagging cells for timing or profiling is more likely to be persistent, so I prefer to have self-explanatory terms used there.\n\nps - note that this PR needs a rebase.  @tkf, if you can do that and the minor cleanups indicated above, I think we're close to merge point.\n"

    "body": "> cells tagged with %exe -t, which is fairly cryptic\n\nIt is easy to add long options, like `%exe --time`.  Also as I said, it is pretty straight forward to provide `%time` as an alias of `%exe --time`.\n\n> Keep in mind that %run is mostly used at the terminal clients\n\nWell, I use `%run` a lot in notebook and I don't understand why it should not be used or discouraged in notebook.  Yes, I know that explicit is good but in notebook you need to balance explicitness and conciseness.  And I think IPython magic as the system to balance the two.\n\nI am not focusing on naming issue.  I agree that `%time` looks better than `%exe -t`.  I am just pointing out that you loose ability to combine command if you go `%debug`/`%time`/... way.\n"
