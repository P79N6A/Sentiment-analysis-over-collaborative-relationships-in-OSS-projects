I am particularly concerned that just doing and enpkg --update breaks up things and would like to know if such steps have to be taken for every pyzmq/ipython related update in future. If that is the case then I can hack-up a simple bash script that could be used for future updates.\n\nFor the record, here is the output log for all steps:\n1. completely remove IPython and pyzmq\n   http://pastebin.com/QCPJeHTD\n2. download pyzmq\n   http://pastebin.com/Ak4aJ4z6\n3. install pyzmq:\n   python setup.py configure --zmq=/usr/local\n   python setup.py build\n   python setup.py install\n   http://pastebin.com/pHiQArct\n4. test pyzmq (after leaving the pyzmq build directory)\n   nosetests -v zmq.tests\n   http://pastebin.com/TQCw7zkG\n5. reinstall IPython\n   http://pastebin.com/Bczrwzzr\n6. test plain IPython\n   ipython\n   import zmq; print zmq\n   http://pastebin.com/B4iDNBj1\n7. test the notebook\n   ipython notebook\n   http://pastebin.com/2SqPS09C\n"
