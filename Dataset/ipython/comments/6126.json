I've added a `spec_changed.Kernel` event, which is fired when:\n- The user chooses a different kernel from the list\n- A notebook is loaded with kernelspec metadata\n- A session has started, if the kernel name in the response is different from the kernel name requested. This is to handle the case where the frontend asks for the 'python' kernel, and we only know from the server's reply whether that's Python 3 or 2.\n\nWhen the event fires:\n- The kernel's display name in the top right is updated\n- The codemirror mode is set, both for all existing code cells, and the default for any new code cells\n- The kernel spec is stored in the notebook metadata\n"

    "body": "Despite the fact that Brian raises valid points, I must say that I strongly disagree. \n\nWhen designing a UI I do not think you should care about the implementation detail and the embedding use case. UI should be focus in usage.\n\nAs you stated, it is commonly known that toolbar is used for frequent action. I know it is exciting to switch language on the fly, but it is likely to be an extremely rare action, majority of the user will not use, and 95% of the rest will use it once when starting each notebook. Half I the remaining power user will change the default.\n\nThus the kernel selector does not enter the category of commonly use actions. Placing it in the toolbar is _a loss of available space_. Also it is, as you said, a destructive action, so you do not want it to be easily accessible.\n\nI also believe that the \"clean separation of abstraction\" you - as a developer - see in the UI is invisible to most. I create a notebook with a name and a kernel once, this is a creation step, everything is in the top bar, it's nice. The notebook language would have been store in the filename extension, should we have put the menu in another place ?\n\nAs far as embedding, I'm sorry to say that, but it's their job, we already provide simple API to change kernel, it is not as if just commenting one line in main.js would deactivate our kernel selector. \n\nThey have already clearly shown that they can patch these stuff.\n\nI know it is convenient to see things also from dev point of view, but try to forget this POV when speaking UI.\n\n> Le 23 juil. 2014 à 04:03, \"Brian E.

    "body": "# This design decision:\n\nI agree that our main concern should not be embedding, but usability. But I\ndon't think we can ignore embedding entirely.\n\nFrom a usability standpoint I think all of this pivots on one question: is\nchanging kernel a common action for our users or not?\n\nA) It is common\n\nThen, it should go both in the Kernel menu and the toolbar. This is the\ndesign pattern we are using for all other document/kernel related UI\nelements. This choice is also supported by principles of good design:\n- It creates visual hierarchy (kernel things grouped together inside\n  toolbar between document and menus).\n- It puts like things together (kernel things by kernel things, commonly\n  used actions in the toolbar, all actions in the menus)\n- It is prototypical - users know that web sites use the heading area for\n  site-wide content, not document level elements. All of the sites that we\n  use and love respect this (github, twitter, google, facebook, apple, etc.)\n  and research has shown that prototypically is a strong factor in how users\n  experience web sites.\n\nB) Changing kernels is not common\n\nIn this case, I think the kernel selection should be done only in the\nKernel menu. We might want to indicate visually what the kernel is\nsomewhere, but again, for that indicator I would use the above design\nprinciples to pick where it goes: a) next to the kernel indicator or b)\nnext to the kernel related things in the toolbar or c) somewhere else that\nis close to the document in the visual hierarchy.\n- Side point: we have also talked about having a small language specific\n  icon displayed next to the Jupyter logo (which will replace the large\n  IPython Logo we have currently). Do we have enough info in the kernel specs\n  to add this feature? I have some common language logos (Python, R, Julia)\n  here:\n\nhttps://github.com/jupyter/design/tree/master/languages\n\nSo maybe the first question is: how common will this action be for users\n(outside of our demoing it)?\n\nOne thing that I feel is important in design decisions is that we start to\ndevelop solid principles we can use to make these decisions. I am starting\nto create a wiki page that starts to lay out design principles and some\ngood references...links soon...\n\nI am more than willing to consider putting the kernel selector in the\nheading area if we can establish the underlying design principles that\nsupport putting it there. I personally don't see what those principles are,\nbut I am being serious about being willing to be convinced. Is the idea\nthat the kernel choice is really important and should therefore be at a\nhigh level? Is the idea that the heading area, unlike the rest of our UI,\nhas lots of open space? If available white space is the attraction, what\nabout starting to use the abundant L/R margins of the notebook document?\n\nOn Tue, Jul 22, 2014 at 11:21 PM, Matthias Bussonnier <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Despite the fact that Brian raises valid points, I must say that I\n> strongly disagree.\n> \n> When designing a UI I do not think you should care about the\n> implementation detail and the embedding use case.

    "body": "Two reasons why I think this should be in a prominent place:\n- As mentioned, it will often be important when you create a new notebook and want to change what type of notebook you're working on. I don't want to force the user to answer a question about kernels before they start writing a notebook (in many cases, after all, they will want the default kernel), so it has to go somewhere within the regular notebook UI.\n- The information about which kernel you're using definitely needs to be clearly visible, and it makes clear sense for that UI element to also be where you change the kernel. This will be enhanced when we also display logos for the kernels.\n"

I don't think many user \ndo need to change mid-session the kernel (agreed with warning though).\n\nAnd a Pyhton, Haskell, R or  Julia  noteook, is inherently Python/Haskel/R, or Julia based, \nregardless of wether kernels runs.

    "body": "I think we are getting bogged down in trying to parse the exact proportion of kernel versus document related effects. I am not denying that this action has document related effects and no one is denying that it has kernel related effects. For our users documents and kernels are inextricably linked.\n\nThe exact proportion of document/kernel effects doesn't change my case about the design principles governing where overall we should put this UI element. Putting the language selector in the heading is out of existing visual hierarchy, not nearby any other document/kernel related UI elements, not by other commonly used indicators or UI elements and it is in a location that traditionally is reserved for site wide navigation.\n\nMaybe it doesn't make sense to group the other kernel related actions with this selector in the toolbar. I am open to that.\n\nBut we also need to get input from @minrk @jdfreder @fperez and others.\n\nAnother way that @jdfreder and I iterate on design things is to implement something multiple way and try it out. When working with a designer we would certainly do this. To be honest, right now I would describe my preferences towards the toolbar as thus: I hypothesize that it would better in the toolbar. It would be best for us to try a few things out. \n"

    "body": "We might want to discuss this with higher bandwidth tomorrow at the online dev meeting.  In the meantime, a couple of things to keep in mind:\n- the header and the toolbar can both be toggled off. For that reason, it's important to expose this functionality in the menus, and I'd be strongly in favor of some indicator next to the kernel activity icon as well.  \n- I think that changing kernels should be a fairly rare action once a notebook has been created. We shouldn't make it particularly difficult, and we should make it visually very clear always _what_ kernel is running (see my point above), but I don't think people are going to be switching languages back and forth frequently. Other than python2/3, or switching between versions of a given language kernel for experimentation reasons, once you've picked a language for a notebook it kind of makes sense to let it be.\n- I think we need to record the default kernel _at notebook creation time_, so that if a notebook is created and saved immediately, it's already a valid notebook. We can work on the UI so that the choice is as easy as possible, e.g. with a button that remembers its default value and has a side-dropdown for quick access to alternatives.  But once created, a notebook should _always_ know how to run code without further user actions (even if we delay kernel starting to first-cell-executed, we should still know what kernel we're supposed to start).\n"
