    "body": "Now I'm actually wondering if this is the best way to do it. Basically my point was that when you define a function in a cell (with %%cython or not), it is available in the namespace. But if it's a Cython function, it is not available in another %%cython cell, which may be slightly confusing for a beginner. Besides, it makes this %%cython less useful in my opinion.\n\nUsing explicit names might work, but it would force one to give names to every cell and to import these small modules manually in the other %%cython cells. It would be great if it could work automatically, i.e. a function defined in one %%cython cell is directly available in another %%cython cell. It might be a bit tricky to implement. Thoughts?\n"
