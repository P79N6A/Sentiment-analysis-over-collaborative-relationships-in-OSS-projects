Maybe temp_backend?\n\nFor the records (as I might not be here for the decision hangout):\n- I'm fine with this leaving where it is now.\n- naming it just 'backend(...)' is ok for me too (or anything) as it is meant to be a context manager, it seem pretty obvious that it will switch back.\n- I would be in favor of already having shortcut context manager, namely `qtbackend`,`inlinebackend` ... etc\n\nAnd one last question, should check that `old != new` and do nothing otherwise ?\n"
