Maybe it's just that something is doing `'\\n'.join(somelist)` when it should instead read `''.join(somelist)`, not sure...\n"

The notebook viewer displays the annotated source [without extra spacing](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/3345121).\n\nIf you want to play around with the CSS without installing Cython, I've posted a [simple notebook](https://raw.github.com/gist/3345121/faea44bb266d01a3eaae851d4dfd107843ea17e0/Cython%20Magic.ipynb) which you can download and work with.\n"
