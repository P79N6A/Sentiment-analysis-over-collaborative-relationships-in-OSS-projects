It looks like you only have the problem when the text is enclosed in a fragile latex environment that doesn't support line endings.  In other words, the latex failure is expected but not the new lines that are causing it.\n\nHow did you get the new lines in the heading blocks via the Markdown cell (without modifying the tex by hand)?  I can't even manage to get them in (nor should I be able to, without editing the tex by hand, like @Carreau mentioned above).  \n\nNow, I can make my tex fail, if I type line breaks into a heading cell.  However, the line breaks aren't supported in heading cells, and should be removed.  In the notebook, when I deselect the cell, the line breaks are not visible (proper behavior).  BUT, when I export that same file using nbconvert, the line breaks make it all the way through to the tex.  **This is the bug.**  Now I think you were onto something in your original post, the CR +CR + LF line endings may be confusing the code that is supposed to remove all line endings in headers.  _I will look into this right now._\n\nIf you're willing to, please post the notebook, or just the Markdown portion of it, that is causing the trouble so I can try it on my machine.  \n\n> open issue for the markdown `![caption](...)` problem?\n\nNot that I know of\n"

Issue #3819 addresses it specifically.~~\n\n~~The line breaks that were causing pdflatex to barf were caused by a Pandoc 'feature'.  **#4202 fixes this and should close this issue**.  It works for all of my test cases but I would still appreciate your input if you are willing to test it too :smile:   Thanks!~~\n\nSee Min's PR below. :)\n"
