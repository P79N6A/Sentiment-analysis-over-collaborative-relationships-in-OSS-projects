    "body": "Hi, \n\nThanks !\n\nI don't think the choice for jpeg should be done in the kernel before nbconvert processing. \nIn any case this is a mechanism we will update soon, so the part of the  patch that allow inline-backend=jpeg will probably be refused (or at least it should be discussed in an orthogonal PR). We will move toward arbitrary mime type in new notebook format.\n\nI think It would be much better to have a preprocessor in nbconvert that png->jpeg.\n\nI'll re-check, but the highlighting in the browser is something that make sens and that I was planning to do on nbviewer too to reduce page size. But I'd like to avoid to hardcode `lang-python` as ipynb can also have ruby/julia/haskell...\n\nWill do more comment later.\n"

    "body": "Hello,\n\nIndeed, I just stumbled upon stubs (in the nbconvert's code) that convert pictures as a preprocessor. This is definitely the way to go to convert to a blog format (or anything else). \n\nHowever, the InlineBackend.figure_format option also allows for JPG compression during normal notebook (not nbconvert-targeted) use. Anyway, if arbitrary mime-types are planned then jpeg is included, so I'm fine with that ^^.\n\nConcerning hard-coded css classes, I wasn't aware so many languages were supported. It certainly makes sense not to hardcode the language. I will check to see if this can be handled more gracefully.\n"

    "body": "The two previous commits enable in-browser syntax highlighting both in notebook and in nbconvert in markdown and input cells.\n- In notebooks it will highlight markdown code blocks with highlight.js' language autodetection. If fenced blocks are used it might be able to use the specified language (untested). It doesn't touch to input cells (handled by codemirror).\n- In nbconvert's output it will highlight markdown code blocks with google_code_prettify language autodetection. It will highlight input cells using the cell's language attribute.\n\nThe current situation where i use both prettify and highlight.js is because my primary choice was prettify and suspected the highlighting in the notebook was being done by pygments on the server side. I then found out there was already highlight.js in the code base. I'm undecided regarding what's the best choice.\n"

The only difference is the highlighter being used. The notebook uses highlight.js while the template uses prettify. I think I prefer prettify for one main reason: line numbers can be enabled.\n\nOn a side note, I think I've been misusing git fetch/merge upstream to keep up-to-date with upstream. Maybe rebase would have been better. If this causes headaches, I'll just create a good old patch. But I really need to understand this git thingy more deeply!\n"

    "body": "To be a little more specific about what ivanov said: \n\nWe discussed this PR yesterday on google hangout, so you can get exactly what was said it is available on youtube. To recap, we believe that this PR mix many things. and that they should probably be separated. \n- Jpeg Formater for inline figure\n- lightweight blog templates\n- minimal pandoc version check\n- some fix for highlight\n- filters for nbconvert. \n\nThe templates itself will not be accepted, as we try to keep bare minimal template into IPython itself. \nIf you cannot do something with `--template` flag or config, then there is probably something we need to fix.\n\nWe agreed that highlighting should be fixed; we don't know how yet. \n\n---\n\nI have no strong feeling about pandoc version\n\n```\ndef escape_for_html(text):\n +    return html_escape(text)\n```\n\nwhy not keep `html_escape` ?\n\nI would like also to apologize for responding late, and usually we respond to PR paster.\nI hope that splitting this into smaller chunk will help to review each of them more quickly.\n\nThanks.\n"

    "body": "Hello guys,\n\nThanks for the feedback. I'm all for splitting this into chunks and putting the template somewhere else.\n\nCarreau : Do you mean that the name `html_escape` was better? I think you're right, I have no clue to why I suddenly changed it! If you mean there's already an `html_escape` equivalent function somewhere, I probably missed it OR it had limitations that since then I forgot about (and that I should have documented). \n\nWhat I'll do, if you agree, is redo this work cleanly :) It was my first github collaboration and I think my workflow was not good (should have worked in branches of course!). So, this PR can be closed and I'll submit new ones when specific points are (from your bullet list) are ready.\n"
