    "body": "Hi minrk, incognito mode was different but not entering command mode.\n\nI realized another strange behavior present in the original enironment:\n    The mark up cells appear as regular code cells.\n\nIncognito:\n\nIn the \"incognito\" test, the markup cells did in fact, change appearance and become mark up.\nAfter clicking on the mark up cell, the cell went into edit mode. I was able to make changes, but could enter command mode again. The markup cell remained, a grey-lighted box for editing.\n\nI'm still wondering if I'm doing some wrong, I haven't had an example of a \"working\" instance. I've seen how IPNB should look when reading them on the web.\n\nOther Browser:\n\nMy work environment doesn't allow me to use another browser. We use Okta if that helps. I'm also new to this type of work setup, where most software runs on the cloud and there's a generic interface ( Okta ). As far as I can tell, my Chrome  is running locally though.\n"
