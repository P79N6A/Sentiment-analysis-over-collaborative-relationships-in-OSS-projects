    "body": "This enables resume of controller, but also removes explicit identities from the Client.\n\nWe need to make a decision on the explicit client identities, because there is a reason to go either way:\n1. in libzmq-2.1, setting an explicit identity results in a 'durable socket', which means that the Schedulers act on the assumption that clients never go away, and queue up replies to disconnected clients in memory.  For users doing 'fire&forget' task submission, this will result in an apparent memory leak in the Schedulers.\n2. The durable socket side-effect of explicit identities is removed from libzmq-3.1.\n3. _removing_ explicit identities means that client sockets will get new identities when using Controller resume introduced here, breaking the propagation of results of tasks submitted prior to controller crash.\n\nSo we have two principal choices:\n1. Continue to use explicit identities, and just state that the apparent memory leak is fixed by upgrading to libzmq-3.1.\n2. Remove explicit identities, and break client-replies across controller restart.\n\nI think 2. makes the most sense, because fire&forget seems more important than preserving interactivity across controller crashes.  The code here reflects this.\n"

We have 70 issues marked for 0.13 and 35 PRs, but I think very few of them actually _need_ to get in to 0.13 (0 of mine, for instance, though I would like the file/shell cell magics).  So if we switch into stabilization-only mode this week, I think we can make it.\n\nIt's a bit of an unfortunate time as we are just now exploring what we can/should be doing with Cell Magics.  \n\nWe still haven't done the cell-metadata bit, which I think is a blocker so we reduce the need to increment the nbformat in the future.\n"
