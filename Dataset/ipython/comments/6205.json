    "body": "What is the current state of the styling for this? A few options for the styling, mostly taken from the Google Drive UI (for documents):\n1. As the page narrows, incrementally hide parts of the \"saved ... ago\" text. I think this approach of hiding UI elements is way better than increasing the vertical height of an element to keep the content there, but in a wonky way.\n2. Put the \"saved ... ago\" information in the menu bar, like Google Drive does. But this is also an area that we might use for other things.\n3. Put the \"saved ... ago\" right below the notebook name. We might have to play with the font sizes and spacing for this.\n\nHere is my preference at this point: let's just hide the \"saved...ago\" text entirely when the page is too narrow and defer the bigger UI re-design questions to later.\n"
