The inline backend uses\n`bbox_inches='tight'` to reduce the amount of white space around the figure. IMHO it would be better to use\n`plt.tight_layout()` that optimises the layout of of the figure to minimize white space but keeps the same figure size instead of clipping.  Unfortunately that still has some limitations that makes this impossible at the moment. \n"

The issue that I linked to and which is fixed is that the bbox of the legend is not calculated when the box around the legend is hidden. This is fixed in the mpl 1.2.x and master branch already. Do you have the option to test mpl from the 1.2.x branch?\n"
