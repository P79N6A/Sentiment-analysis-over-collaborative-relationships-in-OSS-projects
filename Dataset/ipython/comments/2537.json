    "body": "These are all great points - but I don't think the solution is to move examples back into /docs:\n- The current realization of the docs directory is that it is really the gory internals of the sphinx documentation build.  It is not a place that is designed for users to go and start out.  If we want to point new users at these notebooks it should be in a user friendly location, not burried in our sphinx docs. \n- The material in examples is a horrible mix of random things, raging from standalone .py examples, domain specific examples (Monte-Carlo options pricing), full blown tutorial notebooks, etc.  I don't think these things all below together.  We need some fresh ideas on 1) what types of code related learning materials we do want 2) how those should be organized and 3) where they should be.  This is complicated to the existence of the ipython/talks and ipython/ipython-in-depth repos that have additional tutorlal style information.\n- If we do want to embed notebooks in sphinx, there is not any problem will pulling that content from outside the docs directories (from a top-level examples directory or somewhere else).\n"
