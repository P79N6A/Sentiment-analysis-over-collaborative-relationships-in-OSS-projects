    "body": "summarizing the face-to-face with Min: it's kind of ugly to copy the metadata passed to the display calls to every mime-type representation of an object (growing the message), especially since other consumers of the API (e.g. @jasongrout over on the Sage Notebook side of things) would not expect this.\n\nThis PR started off making calls like `display(obj, metadata={'isolated': True})` into a metadata dict that looks something like this: `{'text/plain': {'isolated': True}, 'image/svg+xml': {'isolated': True}}`, since the code in #4250 provided an implementation to handle this form. \n\nThe approach we're going with is:\n-  have the javascript code also handle just a top-level `{'isolated': True}` in the metadata, while also retaining the form originally provided in #4250. This means that both of the following two calls will be supported, and will function in the same manner, though the displaypub message will be different:\n\n``` python\n    display(SVG(s), metadata=dict(isolated=True))\n    display_svg(SVG(s), metadata=dict(isolated=True))\n```\n- `isolated` will be made a keyword argument to our SVG and HTML object (the most likely place to use such functionality). This will enable the above functionality via just `display(SVG(s, isolated=True))`\n"
