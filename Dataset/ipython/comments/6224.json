    "body": "We can't reasonably use ujson, cjson, or jsonlib due to compatibility issues. The only real options in our case are simplejson (which is the same as stdlib json, but probably a later version, at least on Python 2) and jsonlib2.\n\nIn our cases, the benefits of slightly faster JSON are not great, and one needs to be more careful than the proposed import because we have found users who have simplejson that is actually _older_ than the version shipped in Python 2.7, which did cause problems.\n"
