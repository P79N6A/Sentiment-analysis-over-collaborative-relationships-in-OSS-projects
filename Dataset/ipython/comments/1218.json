    "body": "Thanks! Sorry for the little runaround.  This didn't need to be a new pull request, the change could have been made with a `git commit --amend` to your previous branch, but this is certainly fine, and I'll go ahead and merge.\n\nRe: whitespace - the issue is that we _do not_ have a whitespace policy, so when editors enforce one it can result in committing changes irrelevant to the actual code, which we do try to avoid.  If there ever is 'cleanup' to be done, it should be done in isolation, not in the same commit with actual code.  I will add a small note to this effect, thanks.\n"
