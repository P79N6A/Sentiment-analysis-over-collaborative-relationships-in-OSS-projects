    "body": "Great!\n\nAs we think about moving widgets into its own package/library, one of the big questions will be what is the API for other projects (like the notebook) to integrate widgets. I don't know how it affects this PR design but it would be nice if \"widgets were just another package\" that could be used with the notebook. Because of this I am hesitant to hardwire widget abstractions to the details of the notebook. In some ways, splitting widgets into a separate repo will be the right point to test that these abstractions make sense...\n"

Here's some working code that persists all widgets, visible or not and with live comms, across page refresh.\n\nThe `widget_manager.get_state` method is configurable so you can change the persistence behavior in your persistence implementations:\n\n``` js\n\n    WidgetManager.prototype.get_state = function(options) {\n        // Get the state of the widget manager.\n        //\n        // This includes all of the widget models and the cells that they are\n        // displayed in.\n        //\n        // Parameters\n        // ----------\n        // options: dictionary\n        //  Dictionary of options with the following contents:\n        //      only_displayed: (optional) boolean=false\n        //          Only return models with one or more displayed views.\n        //      not_alive: (optional) boolean=false\n        //          Include models that have comms with severed connections.\n```\n\n**Edit:** Removed example.\n"
