Large,  systematic cleanups should be done in their own PRs that don't otherwise change any functionality, so they are easier to review (and if you want to do that too, don't hesitate).\n\nWe appreciate your contribution, and once you get a hang of the process you'll see it goes pretty smoothly.  Let us know if anything isn't clear and we'll be happy to help you.\n"
