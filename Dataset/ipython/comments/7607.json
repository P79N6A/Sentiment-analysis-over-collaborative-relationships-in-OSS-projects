Briefly:\n- when you \"Publish\", it copies your notebook into your Public folder (creates it if necessary), and sets proper permissions. This is an even larger hack [1] where the javascript sends the kernel Python code to execute, using callbacks to confirm and show URL of nbconvert-view of notebook (via PublicHandler)\n- PublicHandler will list files in directory, show HTML, images, and render ipynb files (with header)\n- Make a copy will do similar as Publish, but copies other's notebooks into an Incoming folder. \n\nNext, I'm working on:\n- browsing others' \"published\" notebooks\n- a \"Submit\" button for turning in homework\n\nThis is all prototype code to be suggestive to a developer of _what_ we want, but not _how_ it should be done.\n\n[1] - https://bitbucket.org/ipre/calico/src/master/notebooks/nbextensions/calico-publish.js\n"
