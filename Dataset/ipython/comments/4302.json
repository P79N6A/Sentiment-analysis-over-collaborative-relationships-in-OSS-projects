    "body": "I've added a simple example in the rich display example notebook. Also, I have installed python 3.3 and tested my code. Lo and behold, my code worked! I guess I can finally switch to python3 now. \n\nI'm still wondering about this fallback performance stuff. After testing a bit I have realized that the generic normalizing method is actually only very slow if it is run on a numpy array. Hence if the pure python normalization is only used as a fallback it is only about 2x slower than the numpy version. It is not impractically slow for any data that you'd wanna embed in the notebook, in my opinion. I am fine either way. As @minrk said, most people will have numpy. @ellisonbg @takluyver what do you think?\n\nI don't think it is necessary to have a limit on the list length as @ellisonbg  suggested. I tested embedding a 20 minute 44100 Hz signal without problem. That is an array of length 53e6. I think the user knows it will take a few seconds to embed that. \n\nWhen that question is resolved and unless there are other things I think this is ready to be reviewed. \n"
