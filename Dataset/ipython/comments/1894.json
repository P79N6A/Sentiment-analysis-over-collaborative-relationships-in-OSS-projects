The following is from http://docs.python.org/release/3.1.5/whatsnew/3.0.html:  “Renamed module **builtin** to builtins http://docs.python.org/release/3.1.5/library/builtins.html  (removing the underscores, adding an ‘s’). The **builtins** variable found in most global namespaces is unchanged. To modify a builtin, you should use builtins http://docs.python.org/release/3.1.5/library/builtins.html , not **builtins**!”\n\nI’m guessing that’s all it is.\n\nRegards,\nDave\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Thomas Kluyver [mailto:reply@reply.github.com] \nSent: Sunday, 10 June 2012 9:17 PM\nTo: David Healy\nSubject: Re: [ipython] Win64 binary install fails (#1894)\n\n`__builtin__` is what the importable module is called: http://docs.python.org/library/__builtin__.html\n\nNo idea why it's failing.
