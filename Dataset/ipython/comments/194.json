This is because we're using pexpect now.\n\nThis is a necessary limitation in the two-process model, but it accidentally carried over to the single-process shell.\n\nI'm closing this bug because it's not about sudo, but I'll open a separate ticket to remind me of the fact that for the one-process shell, we need to restore the direct access to subprocesses we've always had.\n\nThanks for the report, I would have forgotten about this otherwise!\n"
