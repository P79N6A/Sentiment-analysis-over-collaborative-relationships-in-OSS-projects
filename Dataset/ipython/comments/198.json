    "body": "I know, every time I have to work with windows, I work myself into a white-hot fury. That I bothered to offer this improvement is proof of my everlasting love for you, I mean IPython, I mean that I had to do it for a project of my own and wanted IPython to benefit as well.\n\nBut you were right, the post-install routines were kinda hosed, especially when setuptools is installed. I just posted an additional commit that takes care of it. As far as I can tell, windows post-installation scripts only work with bdist_wininst, they don't seem to be executed with bdist_msi. Worth bearing in mind when it comes time to cutting a release.\n"
