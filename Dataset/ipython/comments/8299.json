    "body": "Hmm, I have also seen sys.prefix be \"wrong\". I don't know why or how they do that. But assumedly systems that do change sys.prefix are doing so because they want things to be installed into that prefix instead of where Python really is. \n\n> When we've had this discussion previously, it has come round to 'maybe we should provide a flag to specify the target directory explicitly', followed by 'wait, that would just be an incredibly verbose spelling of cp'\n\nYou can't necessarily cp after installing, because you might not even have permissions to write /usr. And anyhow, I think to most people, what `ipython kernelspec install` actually does can be opaque. The fact that it's just `cp` is not clear at all. \n\nIt also complicates things like https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel/blob/0b64531109e1ca10c1a19c164d72dd2246566f86/R/kernel.r#L248 (which is where this originates for me; in my recipe for IRKernel, I have to [use cp](https://github.com/conda/conda-recipes/blob/aca156081ba5d2a3a9f14e23c7e8f0f9a4bc9621/r-packages/r-irkernel/build.sh#L13)). \n"
