You will NOT be able to run code. Your browser may not be\ncompatible with the websocket version in the server, or if the url does not\nlook right, there could be an error in the server's configuration.\n```\n\nAnd I am indeed not able to run code - I entered `3+3` in the input cell and\nnothing happened. The URL of the new notebook is `http://127.0.0.1:8888/new`.\n\nEpiphany is great for IPython notebooks because it has a [web application mode](http://www.webupd8.org/2011/10/install-epiphany-320-with-web.html) which makes IPython notebook behave like any other (native desktop) application you have installed - it appears in dash, application lists, etc.\n\nEdit: Notebook doesn't work in Epiphany in master too. I am pretty sure that it worked a couple of days ago though.\n"
