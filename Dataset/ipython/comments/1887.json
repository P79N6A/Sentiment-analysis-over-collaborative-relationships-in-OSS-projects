    "body": "So there is some weirdness about the load event.  It looks like it\nmight only be called on page load, but I think that browsers also call\nit at later times (otherwise, jpeg/png would never be resizable).  I\nthink the problems are coming from weird timing issues about when load\nis being called and going to be hard to fix using our current\napproach.\n\nWhat about the following UI: we don't call resizable initially, but\nonly put a click/dblclick event on the image that toggles the image\nbeing resizable.  We could then use this UI to also return the image\nto its original size.\n\nOn Fri, Jun 8, 2012 at 11:43 AM, Min RK\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\n> The minHeight/Width will also not help in this same case, because the h/v values you are using are zero.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1887#issuecomment-6210156\n\n## \n\nBrian E.
