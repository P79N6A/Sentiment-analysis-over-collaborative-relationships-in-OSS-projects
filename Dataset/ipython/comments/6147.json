    "body": "There's something funky here. In the output of `ipython kernel`, we suggest using `quit` to exit the kernel from a console. This works in master, but not after the PR because the frontend intercepts the command.\n\nOn the kernel, `exit is quit`, so there isn't much of a reason for them to behave differently.\n\nShould the exit prompt in the terminal ask about shutting down the kernel?\n"
