For future reference how does one remove the merge commit from a pull request?\n\nYou can just remove it on your local branch and do a forced push.\nGithub will notice that and update accordingly.\n\nAlso, for pull requests, it's best if the branch you work on is named\nin a way related to the fix/feature (could be just fix-337, for\nexample). That makes the merge commit messages more informative than\n'merged master into master' :)\n\nThanks again!\n\nf\n"
