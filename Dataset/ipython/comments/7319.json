    "body": "And this is an extract of the first exchange:\n\nHi folks!\n\nAndrew wrote:\n\n> With regards to the menu bar, I have one main bit of feedback: the menu bar and the \"notification area\" are currently the same area, which is a problem. I wanted to get rid of the menu bar but not the notification area (that says \"Kernel Restarted\" and such), but it was very hard to do with just CSS. I do not know what sort of changes you are making, but if you could accommodate users who want to hide the menus but not the notification area, I think that would be an improvement, since the two are not actually related to each other in terms of features. \n\nBrian responded :\n\n> I will admit that this aspect of customization is not easy, but I don't know how to do that without significant refactoring of the code and UI. The challenge is to do this in a way that doesn't take up more real estate in the default mode. \n\nAndrew:\n\n> As an aside, I've watched a lot of new users try out my app, as I've done some user testing. What I found is that although I adore the IPython interface, it's actually very unfriendly towards new users, and that they often get stuck on very trivial things. Two that come to mind immediately: one new user spent almost 25 minutes trying to figure out how to change a cell from Python to Markdown. She entered markdown repeatedly and didn't understand why it gave her an error, because she hadn't made the cell a markdown cell (it was still a python cell). She simply did not notice the abscence of In[...], and there's very little other indication. Another user played around with the notebook, then accidentally set off a very long-running computation. He then was very confused as to why no more cells were evaluated – In[_] turns out to be a mediocre way to signal \"I'm busy\", and he just thought that everything had broken and he had to restart the application and that it was buggy. I think that at least might be easily fixed by letting cells have some sort of spinner indicating business instead of In[_], people are more used to that. I am happy to share some more of these experiences if you think it would be useful – do you know whether the IPython team has done this sort of user testing on new users before? \n\nBrian\n\n> Yep, I have seen things like this as well in working with new users. Part of it is that the notebook has abstractions that are not familiar to new users. If they don't understand those abstractions, the UI won't make much sense. Where we can do better is in representing those abstractions in the UI in a more obvious, and self-documenting manner.\n> - We can definitely look into having a spinner to indicate a cell that is working.\n> - We could also tell the user how many running cells there are in the restart kernel dialog.\n> - We definitely need a signifier, on the cell itself, that indicates the cell type. Don't know how to do this in a way that isn't annoying. We do have the unused prompt area that we could put something in when a md cell is in edit mode.\n> \n> I am thinking about doing some basic user testing in early Jan. before 3.0 goes out the door. I would just follow the approach described in \"Don't Make Me Think\" with some people in person.\n\nFor readers, the app we are talking about in these comment is kronos notebook: www.kronosnotebook.com\n"

    "body": "> One user could not figure out what the dark circle in the top right was (the kernel busy / available indicator). She spent the entire half an hour session wondering aloud what it was but never figured it out. So perhaps the \"kernel busy\" indicator (right now a circle that turns light or dark) could also be replaced with a spinner of some sort.\n\nI think people were agains a moving part here but it's worth considering. \n\n> One user, after trying my app, wanted to see how it looked in a normal web browser. She was frustrated at one point because she was using Safari, and had a very small screen (effectively), and had a very difficult time reading the keyboard shortcuts, because the keyboard shortcut dialog renders very badly (does not scroll, too, making it impossible to see most of the shortcuts if you have a small screen).\n\nHum, this look bad, I can't reproduce. Maybe a Yosemite only bug ? I've open a PR that should help a bit on narrow screens. but I can't see the not-scrolling overflow thing, so I'll have issues to debug. \n\n![capture d ecran 2014-12-26 a 19 17 58](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/335567/5558780/fe19bb30-8d33-11e4-9b4d-7fe42bac0087.png)\n\nYou'll notice that now on macs the shortcut should show with native command option shift and escape symbol. \n\n> [markdown new line stuff]\n\nWe'll try to have a look. \n\n> However, one thing I was surprised by was that the command mode did not seem to cause people any problems. I don't think any of them realized there was an \"edit\" and \"command\" mode, but they didnt ever get confused why something worked in one mode but not the other – they very quickly learned that they could click outside a cell to get into \"command\" mode and then do what they wanted.\n\nGood. \n\n> How to user-test\n\nThank, really usefull. \n"
