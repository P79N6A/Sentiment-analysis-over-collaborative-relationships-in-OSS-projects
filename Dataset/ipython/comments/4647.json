Otherwise, a potential author will be confused because what they type does not create the same results.\n\nThe reason that Marked+MathJax doesn't work the same as Pandoc is that Pandoc, by default, [doesn't pass through TeX commands that aren't surrounded by `$$` unless the output is Markdown or LaTeX](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#raw-tex).  See my comment https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/4234#issuecomment-24869618 in response to Issue #4234 raised by @ketch.\n\nI don't know exactly how or where you're calling pandoc here, but it may be that `reveal.js` is not considered a \"Markdown\" output, which would be why the raw TeX isn't being passed through here. \n\nI assume that `pandoc` receives Markdown as an input and is asking for `reveal.js` as an output.  This seems a bit wonky, since both formats are Markdown, and you are just adding some header information at the top.  I guess I'm confused as to how this is all implemented, so it's hard for me to provide advice on how to fix it (although I know several mathematicians and engineers who would be really happy to have it!).\n"
