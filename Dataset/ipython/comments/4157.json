    "body": "Hi @stonebig,\nthis is a pandoc problem. It appears if the $ starting a math environment is on a separate line (so is is not related to your matrix). I think is is not raised as an separate issue, but it has reported by @dpsanders in #3603.\nYou can simple get a \"correct\" conversion if you do\n\n``` markdown\n$\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 3 & 1 \\\\\n0.5 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 5 & -7\n\\end{pmatrix}$\n```\n\nThe final $ can actually placed on a new line, but to be consistent I would append it to the last line.\n"
