And I'm sure most people could tolerate `~/.local/share/ipython` on OS X, windows, and linux.\n- Storing data directly in the home directory and not in the OS-designated location (XDG, `~/Library`, `~/AppData`, etc) is considered poor form. I'd argue that every application that does it is wrong, not just according to the spec, but using the basic namespacing argument.\n- Surely IPython doesn't have the downstream dependencies of bash or ssh or fontconfig? Informing dependents of an upcoming breaking change should be possible.\n- And at minimum the spec merely separates cache and persistent data, a reasonable request similar to OS X's `~/Library/Caches` vs `~/Library/Application Data`.\n"

    "body": "Just to reinforce what others have said, we did roughly follow XDG for a while, by putting the IPython directory in `~/.config/ipython` on Linux and BSD. We decided to return to `.ipython` for two main reasons:\n1. When we describe to users where to look for config files, and things, in docs and in support requests, it's much clearer if we can just refer to one default location, which is the same across all platforms. Cross platform consistency is more important to us than following three different sets of platform specific conventions.\n2. We weren't properly following the XDG spec anyway. Our IPython directory combines things that XDG would split up into config, application data and runtime. Separating those out is a bigger task, leading to additional complexity and maintenance, without much reward.\n\nIf you personally want to go back to using `~/.config/ipython`, you can achieve it by setting the IPYTHONDIR environment variable to that path.\n\nFeel free to continue the discussion here, but I'm closing the issue because I don't think we intend to do anything about it.\n"
