    "body": "It doesn't really make as much sense with a console-like interface. In the notebook, if you make a mistake, you go back and correct it, so you end up with just the code that's worked. If you make a mistake in a console, you try the code again, so the session includes all the code you've entered, whether or not it worked.\n\nThere's a few things it can do: you can export the Qt console session as HTML, you can use %save to make a Python file from it, or %notebook to make a .ipynb file. We're also considering a way to save and restore the namespace you're working in (see #1035 and #112).\n"
