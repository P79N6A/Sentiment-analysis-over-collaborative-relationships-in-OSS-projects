Ultimately we are going to want matplotlib gallery-level example notebooks (maybe even autogenerated from the matplotlib gallery!), and it makes very little sense for that to live in the IPython source repo.\n\nAgreed, not for now, but we'll need to tackle this later on.  We\nreally need to finish up nbconvert soon, so that we can include said\ngallery automatically in doc builds, and rethink our documentation\napproach.  It is tempting to completely separate it, but I also like\nensuring that it's easy to edit the docs in sync with changes to the\ncode.
