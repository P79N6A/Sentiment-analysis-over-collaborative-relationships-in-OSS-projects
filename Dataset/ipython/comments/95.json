I am almost always in the dev root when I run iPython and so have to run scripts that are in subdirectories. When I use autocompletion, it introduces backslashes and so have to (painfully) remember to change them to forwardslashes before pressing enter. Since all the newer versions of windows almost always accept forwardslashes as good as backwardslashes, why not just stick to forwardslashes? For aruguments to external commands (e.g., dir), it would be a problem, but since I run all cygwin commands, I need ONLY forwardslashes.\n\nWhy not provide an option like vim's 'shellslash' and let the user choose?\n"
