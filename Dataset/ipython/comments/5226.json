    "body": "Actually, I think we should differ from plain Python in this situation. IPython is designed for interactive use, and a lot of the time when you run a file, you're using something like the `-i` flag to go into the interactive shell afterwards. Even when you're not, I think it's more relevant for us to provide a similar environment for running scripts as for interactive use. We treat PYTHONSTARTUP the same way as IPython startup files for this reason.\n"

    "body": "Differing is dangerous because `alias python=ipython` works less and less. I use a project which makes use of `PYTHONSTARTUP` to launch its own interactive shell, but only in the event that a file hasn't been passed for execution on the command line. I'd like to be able to just use the same `ipython` binary to launch either the shell or a file from the command line and not have to make a wrapper script which makes assumptions about what command line arguments mean. \n\nAlso, this difference from normal Python is just surprising for me, I assumed it would work the same way the normal Python binary's worked based on the fact that `ipython some_file.py` works the same way, and the usage takes care to explain that.\n\nThat said, IPython definitely is meant for interactive use... hence the i. \n"
