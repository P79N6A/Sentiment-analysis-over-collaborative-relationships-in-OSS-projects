    "body": "@minrk I had a similar problem and tried your suggestion:\n\n`ipython notebook --ip=127.0.0.1`\n\nThis workaround worked for me. Would you mind elaborating on how you knew to suggest this and how we might be able to obtain a more permanent solution?  Also if this solution is likely user specific (e.g. a problem with a user's .ipython configuration), or something related to the core ipython code?\n\nThank you.\n"

    "body": "Yes, sorry. IPython listens on `localhost` by default. `127.0.0.1` _ought_ to behave the same, and does in almost all cases. Some cases where this can be handled differently include local proxies and/or firewalls (usually due to a configuration oversight, rather than an intentional difference in behavior). We have found cases where localhost works and 127 doesn't and _vice versa_, so there isn't an unambiguously correct answer for the default.\n\nDo you have a firewall and/or proxy configuration? If so, do you control its configuration? I would describe this behavior as a bug in your network setup, but it may not be one that you have permission to fix.\n"
