    "body": "<del>\n--location is a shortcut for bypassing IPython's guess about the IP of the machine on which it is running. When you pass ipengine --location=172.16.1.140 you are telling ipengine that *ipengine* is run on the machine 172.16.1.140. ipengine then compares this with the `location` field in the connection file (the controller's IP, and set by ipcontroller --location if you want), and determines that the engine and controller are running on the same machine. Finally, since the controller is listening on all interfaces (*), the engine should use the loopback interface.\n</del>\n\n<del>\nBasically, you told ipengine explicitly that the engine is on the same machine as the controller.\n</del>\n"

    "body": "oh, I see. The documentation seems to contradict this. `ipengine -h` gives:\n\n```\n--location=<Unicode> (EngineFactory.location)\n    Default: u''\n    The location (an IP address) of the controller.  This is used for\n    disambiguating URLs, to determine whether loopback should be used to connect\n    or the public address.\n```\n\nAlso this issue persists regardless of how I set `--location`. Leaving it off entirely or setting it to the actual ip address of the machine I'm starting the engine on seems to give the same behavior. Regardless of how I start the engine, it tries to connect to localhost instead of the `location` specified in the url_file. I'll look into it more tomorrow.\n"
