    "body": "More specifics:\n\n_encode_binary checked if the data was bytes (str on Python 2).  However, this data could still be base64-encoded str if simplejson is in use, rather than unicode, in which case the republishing would double-encode the data.  This, instead, actually checks the first few bytes to see if these are in fact jpeg/png data.\n\nSome alternatives:\n1. handle this in json_clean, so that images anywhere in any message will be b64-encoded\n2. reverse the test, so that rather than checking the first few bytes of data against proper PNG/JPG, check them against b64-encoded PNG/JPEG.  The main difference being how garbage data would be handled.\n"
