    "body": "@minrk Regarding the timeout, do you mean it doesn't fix the scrollbar overlap problem after hiding and then re-showing the output? It does for me, but only with a significant delay so that the extra div remains in the DOM for around 1s or so. Anything shorter, and it didn't fix the problem for me.\n\nI'm fine with merging the padding fix alone to make sure the cells render properly most of the time on notebook load. The add/remove div hack makes my skin crawl.\n\nWant me to submit anew with the CSS changes only?\n"
