This will be a long-term work, because we have so much hardcoded junk in the old code, but that's indeed the right way to approach the problem.\n\nIt's still a good idea for terminal-type frontends to be robust against ansi/xterm escapes (since they can be produced by code other than ipython, like Nicolas' example).  But our own code shouldn't generate them.\n"
