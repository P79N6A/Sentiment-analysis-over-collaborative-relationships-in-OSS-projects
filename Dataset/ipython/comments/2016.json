A few observations:\n- They are valid for arg quoting in gitbash, but not in cmd.exe\n- They are valid filename characters in Windows.\n- The above considerations are probably moot because I don't know how, in the context of the test runner, a single quote would ever slip into this argument list even in gitbash\n- FWIW and disclosure: Actually, at this point I am not even sure that the check for double quote is necessary, because I do not  see how, in the context of the test runner, a double quote would slip into the argument list either. I suspect that when I wrote this workaround last year, I put in the check for an existing double quote because I wasn't sure whether the double quotes that I was inserting might persist into a recursive invocation of the test runner. That doesn't seem to be the case, but I'll respect my qualms of last year and leave it in. I think it's clear that it does no harm.\n"
