    "body": "I'm mainly thinking of what happens if we guess wrong.  If our threshold is too high, we do nothing, and users scroll the long output they wish we had (only bonus).  If our threshold is too low, we are hiding output the user wishes we wouldn't, and they have to _undo_ what we did that they are unhappy with.  This produces an adversarial relationship with the notebook.\n\nI think 50 is closer to ideal (probably too short, especially on large monitors), but it seems more important to be conservative when triggering actions users will want to undo.\n\nBasically, I think we should only be auto-scrolling output that is _too long_, not just output that is pretty long.\n"
