    "body": "You're right, this is ugly.  I've tracked down the \"problem\".  The duplicate and delete buttons are rendering normally, it's the new and refresh buttons that are not.\n\nSteps to verify:\n- Either disable the `float: right` of the `pull-right` class OR remove the `pull-right` class from the button groups we are interested in.  Without this step it will be hard to see what I'm trying to show you because a line break will be forced between the two buttons.\n\n![screen shot 2014-12-18 at 2 32 08 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3292874/5497146/6981fb02-86c3-11e4-956d-f69a377fcad3.png)\n-  Find the `new-notebook-buttons` button group.\n\n![screen shot 2014-12-18 at 2 32 27 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3292874/5497156/89521f52-86c3-11e4-9f43-af889c2fd0f8.png)\n- Disable the `display: inline-block` of `.btn-group`.\n\n![screen shot 2014-12-18 at 2 32 42 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3292874/5497164/a32dbac6-86c3-11e4-84c6-fc64028dcb92.png)\n\nThe results\n\n![screen shot 2014-12-18 at 2 32 48 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3292874/5497165/ac044e8a-86c3-11e4-80bc-9444756472e7.png)\n\nIt appears this is the normal behavior and that if we want padding, we should specify it explicitly.\n"
