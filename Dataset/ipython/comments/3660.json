    "body": "I worry that this will just create more focus issues we have to resolve after 1.0.  In general, anything that draws focus off a cell should drop the notebook into command mode - trying to guess which cell should be focused after the dialog is closed could be problematic.  At the same time, the call you are using here \"select\" won't do the problematic focus step in 1.0, so it is probably OK.   I am 50/50 on this one as we will end up reworking all of this logic after 1.0 anyways.\n"
