    "body": "I've figured out when dnd doesn't work: when the notebook is running in secure mode over https, with Chrome on Linux.  No idea why, but apparently Chrome doesn't like drag and drop when using https.  With firefox, it still works fine.\n\nThe reason why I think this is really critical is that drag and drop has proven to be finicky over time (I've had problems with it several times), and when it fails, it can leave you pretty much stranded.  A simple upload button does the job 100% of the time.  \n\nI seem to recall @rkern posted a while back a link to a prettier solution than the ugly toolkit-driven 'Open' button that we're trying to avoid.  Robert, could you refresh our memory here?\n"

Users should then have the option to change the name of the uploaded notebook, abort that upload or complete it.\n- There is a lot of logic already there for managing all of this that should absolutely be reused and refactored if needed.  The notebook list code is already quite complex and we need to be very careful about making it worse.\n"

    "body": "@ellisonbg ,\nIn #1658, I implemented it in the following way ( it was easier once you drop IE support ) : \n\n> There should be a properly styled jquery UI botton that says \"Upload Notebook\" in the project dashboard.\n\nTo the `Drag notebook...` sentense was added `or click here`. \nClicking  anywhere on the sentense directly open the 'native' file chooser. ( `<input file>` on overlay with opacity 0%, so no other visible  UI element added)\n\nSelect the file, then you click on the 'native' `OK` button. \n\n> Clicking on the upload button should not caused the form to be sumitted - it should used the ajax approach that the drag and drop does.\n> More specifically, after the dialog closes, the uploaded notebooks should be added to the list in the same manner that the drag-n-drop notebooks are. Users should then have the option to change the name of the uploaded notebook, abort that upload or complete it.\n\nThe rest is handle as usual, the `<file input>` `onchange` methods is linked to exactly the same method as `drop` event,  meaning that you still have these upload button, that send the file through the Notebook roothandler, no duplicate code in js, no new code on server side. \n\nThe only 'refactor' I had to do, is to tell the current method how to get the files data from the input field.\n\nI should check what the properties is for multiple file selection and look if you can give a patern to `<file input>` to have the non `(py | ipynb)` files greyed out in the `native|ugly` file chooser\n"
