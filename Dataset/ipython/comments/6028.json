    "body": "If there are any inconsistencies in behaviour, I think we can refer them to upstream - it looks like it's designed to be compatible with marked. So far the only difference I've spotted is that marked highlights GH-style code blocks if a language is specified, whereas neither mistune nor pandoc do. We can easily integrate that with pygments, which is already a requirement for nbconvert to HTML.\n\nI've done some benchmarking with [this notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/unpingco/Python-for-Signal-Processing/blob/master/Expectation_Maximization.ipynb) from the front page of nbviewer. The fastest times I got running `time ipython nbconvert Expectation_Maximization.ipynb` repeatedly:\n- node: 3.4s\n- mistune: 1.2s\n- pandoc: 1.8s\n"

It currently relies on mistune from Github, because I made a small change to the API (see lepture/mistune#11), so we'll need to wait for a new release before merging this.\n\nI've tested this on [a notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/unpingco/Python-for-Signal-Processing/blob/master/Expectation_Maximization.ipynb) with complex expressions, some of which I know it mangled previously; it now gets them right.\n\nRemaining differences from marked:\n- marked puts block-context math inside `<p>` tags, this currently doesn't. Easy to fix if we want to preserve that.\n- marked escapes `'` and `\"` to `&#39;` and `&quot;` respectively. There isn't an obvious option to do this.\n"
