    "body": "Did you mean `--read-only` to be usable in the unauthenticated case at all?  I just tested it, and even if I open the nb with `--read-only`, I still get full read-write access on the designated port.  I was imagining that in the read-only flag would be useful in two different modes:\n1. No authentication: in this case, simply run a _second_ nb on the same directory with `--read-only` and expose that to users.\n2. With authentication: adding `--read-only` allows unauthenticated users to connect as well.\n\nI see the value in 2 when running a full-blown server, but option 1 is very lightweight and I think would be worth having.\n\nDo you think it's difficult to get it in?\n\nIf it's hard and for now we go only with 2, then `--read-only` should raise an error when used without authentication, since it doesn't actually provide read-only access.\n"

It would be nice not to have that flashing of the UI happen.\n\nIf it's not easy, we can defer it to a future point in time and merge this for now, as it's already excellent and immediately useful.\n\nThanks for the awesome!\n"
