So I just want to try a few simple runs with at least SGE/SSH/MPI (the systems I have available to me), to make sure I haven't messed things up.\n\nI would like real tests for the launchers, but since launchers can't run without their various environments (PBS, SGE, etc.) available, unit tests don't have much value.\n"

    "body": "OK, as far as I'm concerned, this is good to go in, once you feel comfortable with whatever testing you can do on your own. Because of this very issue, this is the kind of code that should go in as early as possible, so that we get the kind of 'in the wild' testing that is hard to automate.  The longer it is in the master branch, the higher the chances of someone running it in an environment we don't have access to and pointing out potential problems.\n\nSo go from my side, merge when you're comfortable.  Thanks!\n"
