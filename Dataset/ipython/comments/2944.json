Of course we will keep dev usable as-is. \nProbably with a build step that bundle the right files in the right place.\n\n> Does this handle version dependencies? Will it install exactly the right version of codemirror for the currently-checked out git tree? Can I update the codemirror installation if I check out a different version?\n\nYes, bower does deal with dependencies, right now it target \"latest\" but one can say in the right file to target a particular range of version number or even a specific sha.\n\nRight now this is mostly to see how easily we can use a \"stock\" version of codemirror that does not have extra patches, and test bower.\n\nI would say that you can checkout any version of CM3 as long as it is under /component/codemirror directory it should work, so you can also use submodules or stuff like that.\n"

We need to think about how we want to handle this.\n- Obviously, we do want to ship a stable CM in `static/codemirror`.\n- I am about to start the \"great JavaScript code reorganization\" so we need to finish this PR up soon.\n- Can you update your list of things that need to get done for this to be finished?
