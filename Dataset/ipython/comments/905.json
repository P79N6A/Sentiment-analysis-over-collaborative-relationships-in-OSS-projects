It's just that I hadn't realized we were swallowing it, while it's apparent now that it appears misplaced.\n\nGreat job though, many thanks!!\n"

We were calling the respective low-level functions separately, rather than `pylab_activate()` itself, which does setup _and_ the message.  I can investigate why stdout messages posted prior to the first execution go above instead of below the banner (you can see the same by adding `'print \"hi\"'` to exec_lines, or even `ipython qtconsole -c 'print \"hello\"'`).  Perhaps @epatters knows exactly where to look.  Should be a simple matter of moving the Cursor.\n"
