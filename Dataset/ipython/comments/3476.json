For example, the notebook at \n\n http://nbviewer.ipython.org/5922309\n\nwas developed this spring while I was teaching a class via Wakari.io.  There was a long stretch when the notebook couldn't access local folders.  The ability to run the macro on a remote url saved the day.  \n\nWe also had to reload the page on a regular basis, and using a one word macro was nice.  \n\nWakari provides good file access now, but there are still online installs -- e.g., some EC2 images -- where local folder access is not supported. \n"
