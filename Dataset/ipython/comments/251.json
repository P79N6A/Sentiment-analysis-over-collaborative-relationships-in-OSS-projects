    "body": "This looks great, thanks!  My only suggestion: perhaps extending the test suite to have a case that triggers the try/except clause you added in dict_dir?  Thanks for commenting it so clearly, but with code like that, it's always a good idea to add a test that would fail if someone ever makes a  change that removes that kind of logic.  \n\nObviously with such a good comment in place nobody would explicitly delete that code, but what can happen is that a refactoring effectively changes the logic and the precaution you put in place is sidestepped.  Having a test case that would fail if that happens will serve as a tripwire for the problem from ever surfacing.\n\nOtherwise great job!  If you can add this little improvement, merge away when done.  Thanks :)\n"

Though I suspect you're better than me in that regard :)\n"

Time for some code digging.\n\nAside: I think github's diff view could do a better job where I've indented/dedented lines without changing them.\n\nThanks for the tip on Closes gh-. I'd seen it, but I wasn't quite sure whether to use it on an original commit or on merge.\n"
