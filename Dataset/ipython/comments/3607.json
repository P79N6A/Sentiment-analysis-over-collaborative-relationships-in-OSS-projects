    "body": "@jakobgager Yeah, imagemagick and ciarosvg both rasterize the svg prior to conversion (loss of nice vector art data).  The act of pulling the svg back into the nb may seem wonky, but I had two things in mind\n1. The extract fig transformer should not have to know about the converter at all.  The converter should not know about the extract fig transformer at all.\n2. The notebook in memory **should** be a copy of the notebook just used during the export process (and can be modified freely).  I will double check that this is the case, but it most definitely is for from_filename and from_filestream cases.\n\n@Carreau Sure, I'll add that back for you.  Also, don't forget if you want you can use the public _register_filter_ and _register_transformer_ methods (which are still there).  It wont be an issue to add it to the _export_....()_ convenience methods since they all use *_kw now, I'll just add it to the final method (_export()*).\n\n@ivanov :see_no_evil:  My poor tests branch has been collecting dust for a week now :cry: \n"

I commented some few things because the others have already commented the same things I was thinking when I read the code... \nAs I commented before, and you did that changes very quickly (thanks!), it is better to have all the default transformer in the base Exporter and then only enable the specific (and needed) transformers in each specific exporter (full_html, reveal, rst, etc). The code for the exporters now looks better and more understandable than before.\nTo resume, the PR look nice... I have to test some things about the Writer stuff (and go more deeper) to use it later with the reveal exporter, but overall it looks solid. Congrats @jdfreder and @ellisonbg, great work!\n"

It renders because the end target is a web browser.\n\n@Carreau `ipython nbconvert` without args displays help if there isn't a config file loaded that specifies notebooks.  Otherwise `ipython nbconvert` converts the notebooks in the _notebooks_ list.  We decided against `ipython nbconvert <directory>` in favor of `ipython nbconvert *.ipynb`\n\nI'm okay talking more about the figures / keys, either tomorrow in the video meeting or next week in person.  I was on the fence about that (because of the Win/Nix line ending problem), but @ellisonbg strongly preferred not to have a binary/text subkey and now that it's implemented that way it doesn't bother me.\n"
