    "body": "I feel like the `on_change` function is not different enough to warrant a new function with slightly different behavior---it's confusing the api for events.  The basic idea is that you want a way to clear a handler without having the handler around.  If you can name the handler, then you can clear the handler by name.  You are forcing the name to be the attribute name, but I think that's unnecessarily restrictive.  Returning to my original suggestion, you could do `.on_trait_change({'myname': myfunction}, 'attribute')`.  Each name is tied to one handler.  If you want to clear the handler tied to the name, you do `.on_trait_change({'myname': None}, 'attribute')` or `.on_trait_change('myname', remove=True)`.\n"
