The former tests did not catch this because they only tested one element of the actions list; this PR also corrects and expands those tests.\n"

I'm not sure that this is optimal but it probably doesn't matter and may be set in stone by now, so I would think that qtconsole should simply follow suite.\n\nEDIT: replacing spaces with \"=\" for clarity.\n"

We'll have a quicker-moving pipeline for all of them.\n"
