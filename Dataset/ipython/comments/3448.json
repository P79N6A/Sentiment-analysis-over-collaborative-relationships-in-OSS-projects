From the link you provided, it seem like the `firefox-and-localfont` link only apply to pages loaded with `file://` which we don't do as you are most probably served through localhost. \n\nWe might be able to ship font or provide a simple way to install, the problem is I don't see any way to configure mathjax CDN to use font hosted on localhost. So it will basically not help at all when people came across this bug.\n\nIf we need to depend on `mathjax-fonts-extras` in some cases this is maybe something that should be dealt with by packagers (might be worth pinging juliantaylor about that later on).\n"

    "body": "Hi, I'm part of the MathJax team and just wanted to say hi in case we can help out with any questions.  It was a bit hard for me to judge the situation in the discussion on our user group -- my iPython knowledge is too limited. I'm not sure what the problem is if you're using a local webserver, actually.\n\nI agree that this is probably more of a packaging/dependency question. Installing STIX or our MathJax fonts locally seems like the best option as it helps elsewhere as well (like on MathML site that don't use MathJax). The debian `mathjax-fonts` package is probably better than the `mathjax-fonts-extras` one -- the former has otf and woff fonts. There's also a stix-fonts package IIRC; the STIX fonts are more complete when it comes to the more obscure unicode points.\n"

As I said, the problem caused here is because of Firefox's strict interpretation of the common origin policy. \n\nIPython apparently doesn't provide the OTF fonts in whatever location the page is loaded from so Fx doesn't display them. It would seem that if IPy relies on MathJax then the pages generated by IPy Notebook should explicitly declare the origin of the fonts as safe or something like that -- I'm really not sure about how this common origin policy is to be utilized by webpages or is it by webservers.\n\nAs I also said, installing the STIX outline fonts to my system doesn't help any in solving this problem. All I know is that without the MathJax PNG fonts installed I don't get any Math display from MathJax within IPy Notebook.\n\nMaybe you people want to bring in Mozilla people so they can explain what the technical problem is and how you should solve it.

    "body": "> But the local-files logic is for `file://`, not `localhost`, right?\n\nYes and no, the security policy holds for both but the effects are different. `file://` treats everything that's not a subfolder as a different origin and blocks it (and since there's no server, there's no way to override this with CORS headers). A webserver can run into these, see [our docs on shared installations](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/installation.html#notes-about-shared-installations) but I don't see how`localhost` could run into this issue.\n\n> and the mathjax fonts are served from `https://localhost:8888/static/mathjax/fonts/...`\n> So I cannot imagine that shipping mathjax with IPython would make any difference from having it anywhere else on the filesystem.\n\nAgreed. That setup should not cause any issues. \n\n@jamadagni are you using `localhost` or `file://` to access your notebook?\n"

Perhaps the MathJax people might add an FAQ to their site saying that if a Fx user finds the fonts are not displayed, they should try turning on the above setting.\n\nAgain, thank you both teams for IPy and MathJax!\n"
