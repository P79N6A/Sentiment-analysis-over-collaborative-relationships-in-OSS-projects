    "body": "Actually I don't care too much for those overlapping windows, it was more meant as a side-note; if you are aware of them, then all is fine.\nThe other bug, unfortunately, I don't know how to reproduce the bug even with 3.1. Or: Fortunately, that bug seems to be very rare. Could be a race condition with me clicking \"restart\" to often and at a bad moment. Possibly hard to fix and thus maybe not worth to follow if it doesn't appear more often.\nI was actually rather thinking that maybe one would want an additional safety net for such cases: Implementing a manual way to tell the notebook app that a kernel is gone, such that I can start a new one.\n\nWith respect to 4.0: I wasn't aware of the release. Since IPython is making such tremendous progress lately, I'm generally trying to keep up with new versions. I'll definitely try it out!\n"
