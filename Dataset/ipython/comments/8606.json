    "body": "@davidhalter: We're looking at using Jedi for completions in IPython. A couple of questions:\n1. IPython has some extensions to Python syntax (e.g. `%magics`, `foo?` help). Is there a way to extend Jedi to accommodate these?  \n2. We have some concerns about the speed of completions. Our current completion machinery is pretty basic, but it's usually close enough to instant that the user doesn't notice any delay. How quick is Jedi? How much leeway do the configuration options give us to adjust performance?\n\nThanks!\n"

    "body": "@takluyver \nSorry to delay this for a week. I was on holidays.\n1. I guess controlling the exensions won't be a big issue, since you can just put a function in front of the Jedi calls to handle the extensions accordingly. \n2. Giving you a precise specification of how fast Jedi is, tends to be hard. Jedi is definitely optimized for speed and queries that take longer than 200 ms are worth a bug report. However, while most queries are really fast (< 50ms) you will have slower queries, especially after warm-up (generating the caches) and within extremely large codebases. \n\nJedi has a ton of optimizations to make completing Python fast, among them:\n- A lot of caches (imports, modules, call signatures and a lot them to improve the speed of just one completion)\n- A parser that only parses parts of files when they are modified (probably doesn't improve the speed for REPL completions). \n- In REPL completion Jedi falls back to the default Python logic for REPL completion when possible.\n\nHowever, I expect Jedi to be slow especially when loading new modules. Doing completion async would solve that. Jedi will just be slow on certain occasions. I don't expect Jedi to be fast always. I'd rather have something that either stops Jedi when taking to long or even better is async. However that would require IPython to have an async REPL completion implementation as well.\n\nLet me know if you need to know anything else.\n"
