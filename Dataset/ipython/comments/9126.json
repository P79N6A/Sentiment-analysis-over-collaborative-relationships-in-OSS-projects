You can work around this for Python 2 by defining a custom IO class that accepts bytes or unicode:\n\n``` python\nfrom io import StringIO\nfrom IPython.utils import py3compat\n\nclass MyStringIO(StringIO):\n    def write(self, s):\n        s = py3compat.cast_unicode(s, encoding=DEFAULT_ENCODING)\n        super(MyStringIO, self).write(s)\n```\n\nYou can also mostly get by with [StringIO.StringIO](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stringio.html), but in some situations it will start throwing UnicodeErrors back at you.\n\nOr just use Python 3.\n\nClosing as I don't think we're going to change anything here.\n"
