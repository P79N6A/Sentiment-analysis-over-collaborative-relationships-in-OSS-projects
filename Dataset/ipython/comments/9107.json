    "body": "No, in the kernel, it does actually use `subprocess.Popen()`. Start at `InteractiveShell.system_piped` and follow the layers down. But it sounds like `COMSPEC` is the way to configure the shell either way.\n\nIt looks like cmd.exe is encoding as cp850, and we're decoding as cp1252. But if `locale.getpreferredencoding()` and `sys.stdin.encoding` are both telling us cp1252, I don't see any way that we can infer that we should use cp850 in that situation. I don't want to introduce encoding guessers here - it's extra complexity and I don't think it would work all that reliably.\n\nIf you're really trying to get a list of files, `os.listdir()` will be a much more reliable way to do that than `!dir`.\n"
