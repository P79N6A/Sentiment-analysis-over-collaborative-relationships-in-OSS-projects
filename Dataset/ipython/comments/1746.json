It makes the diff much bigger, so it's harder to see what's really changed. For that sort of straightforward clean up, I think it's OK to push straight to master - or if you do a typo-fixing pull request, we'll fast-track it in.\n"

    "body": "@ivanov, \nYou track the confirm_restart on a per tab basis, but the menu does not always update correctly when you change tab.\nI'm puzzeld on how qt decide to update it, after some test I can't figure out. \nI do not quite remember how or where is tracked wether the visible tab has changed, or even if it is tracked right now.\n\nOr we should do it an the whole qtconsole as 1 option, not per tab.\n\nAs for the UI, the kernel menu is light now, and I think beeing able to toggle without restarting the qtconsole makes sens. You can also  bind a force restart to a much more complicated shortcut that people won't hit by mistake (not ctrl+shift+dot, as dot is accessed by pressing shift on some non-english keyboard, <del>but i'm not against `ctrl+alt+del`</del>)\n"
