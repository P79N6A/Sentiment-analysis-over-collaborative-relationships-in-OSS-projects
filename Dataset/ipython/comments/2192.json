I had a proof of concept on growl like notification in 0.12. outside of the browser.\n\n@jasongrout,\nLooks cool. for now I just want to keep the curent UI and just modifie it.\nYour plugin might be usefull once we want more visible notification like with collaborative editting.\n\nAlso there are a few case where I don't thing you plugin will work. For example, I would like \"save failed\" to be sticky, but discarded if a \"Save sucessfull\" come afterward.\n\nBut i'll look into it.\n"

It fixed itself once the kernel was finished.\n> \n> I don't know if that wants checking here.\n\nI didn't quite get it... is it with this branch or with master ?\n"
