Before we merge this, we need to make sure it does work for at least a few other people and that we document exactly what needs to be done to make it work.\n\nMy config (that works with python-mode 5.2.0 but _not_ with 6.0.3+)  looks like this:\n\n```\n(require 'ipython)\n```\n\nI tried various combinations of setting the `py-shell-name` and `py-python-command` but nothing worked for me.\n"
