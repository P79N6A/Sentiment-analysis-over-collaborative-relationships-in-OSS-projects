I summarised them at the issue https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/5221, and they seem not to difficult to merge them here.\n\nSo for me, this PR is OK (but I didn't really look at the code and I didn't test the doctest part, as this is not used in pandas). However I have the following remark:\n- regarding the default imports in `ipython_execlines`. Is it necessary to have a default value? And more particularly the pylab one `from pylab import *`? For some reason this seems to screw up a part of our docs because pylab imports the datetime module. Off course we can set this to an empty list, but I think more in general `from pylab import *` should not be encouraged?\n- The usage of default / None seems different for mplbackend and execlines: For `ipython_mplbackend` setting it at None imports nothing (while default is 'agg'), while for `ipython_execlines` setting this at None imports the default. Is this None necessary for `ipython_execlines`? Why not simply have: when not specified in conf.py default to the default ['import ...'], otherwise use the one listed in conf.py?\n"

There are also a few other things I'd like to do before this is merged (holidays have distracted me).\n\nRegarding the options, I'm happy to change them to whatever is decided upon.  My rationale for having the import \\* was only because it was in there already. I'd be just as happy setting the default to an empty list, but if we are to have a default, then I'm definitely in agreement on the starred-import: it should be discouraged.  My suggestion for `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt` was a compromise...but I'd really like to remove the import \\* statement altogether.\n\nAs for defaults, that's a good idea.  I'll make the change. Also, I'll probably make a non-backend require the string 'none', and change it so that `None` (the singleton) will keep the default.\n"

The only thing I find a little bit confusing is now that `None` and `'none'` mean two different things. \nAnd then I come back to what I already said :-), I do not really see the need for the `None` option for default (the other ipython directive parameters also do not have that option + it would simplify the code). For me, it would be more logical that `None` would mean no import of matplotlib. But as I said, it doesn't really matter to me, I wouldn't use it.\n\nDoes Sphinx itself use the 'None is default' paradigm?\n"

Instead of just showing the expected and actual outcome, it additionally shows the source file, the uninterpreted input.\n\nThere is one more bug I'm having trouble tracking down. You can see the effect here: http://docs.dit.io/en/latest/measures/shannon.html   What happens is the that `InteractiveShell.run_cell()` is executed and the output of the execution is stored in `self.cout` (see the method `EmbeddedSphinxShell.process_input_line`).  Before `run_cell` is called, `self.cout` is empty.  For the linked example, it contains `' Out[3]: 0.0'` afterwards.  The problem is the space that shouldn't be there.  It's not always inserted, but it seems to be inserted regularly (scroll down the linked page to see further examples).  Anyone know why this might be happening?  I don't think it is the directive...might be something in `InteractiveShell`.\n"
