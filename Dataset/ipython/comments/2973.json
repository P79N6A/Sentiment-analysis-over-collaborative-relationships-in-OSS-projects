    "body": "Ok, then don't worry, and just enjoy it :-)\n\nJust if you are interested in the explanations :\n\nThe issues is that we started with an old version of \"Codemirror\" the library for our text widget. At the time it wasn't supporting markdown hightlighting, so we went with \"html-mixed\" mode. \n\nThis just configure markdown cell to use the new markdown mode....\n\nUsually when you want to test the IPython developpement version, you clone the repo in one folder and do a `pyton setupegg.py develop`. After to test PR, it is just some git foo.\n\nIn this particular case, adding my remote, and pull the right branch. \n\nsomething like\n\n```\n$ git remote add carreau https://github.com/Carreau/ipython.git\n$ git fetch carreau\n$ git merge carreau/md-mode\n```\n\nAnd relaunch the ipython notebook (or just reload the page if it is just javascript changes)\n"
