What I've added is to\nallow me to have RO revisions, and view them as RO and not start new\nkernels. But I can see how this is almost better to be done via nbconvert\n-- just convert the notebook and display it, rather than allowing users to\nopen the notebook. So perhaps that's the right approach for me. Let me see\nif I can learn more about nbconvert and make progress along that path.\n\nStill interested in the refactoring of the manager/dashboard UI, so I don't\nhave to run a separate server for the manager. Let me know your thoughts\nthere.

    "body": "I don't have a lot of knowledge of what can be done with tornado. \nWhat I imagine is having a `/Dasboard/*` handler that delegate everything to something  external or is a class configurable by the user. You could then just subclass our `ProjectDashboardHandler` to add what you need.\nBy default '/' would be the default dashboard, but might redirect on '/Dashboard' otherwise.\n\nIt will of course be nice to have a good way to comunicate between Dashboard/Backend/LoginPage.\nYou could imagine github backend with an OAuth login page  that directly commit on gist or repos...\n"
