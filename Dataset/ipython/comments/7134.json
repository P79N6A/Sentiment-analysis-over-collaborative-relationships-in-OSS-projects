    "body": "A related issue I'm having is that the completer goes \"up\" outside the viewport window. Here's a screenshot showing the full viewport, invoking the completer on `IPython.`.\n\n![completer_dialog](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5607827/7552116/f8b8b118-f670-11e4-8938-c3ff228ae58b.png)\n\nI have some custom css going on but I don't think this the problem. IIRC the issue started after an upgrade but I didn't do anything about it at the time...\n\nIt's a minor annoyance but happens often because leaving edit mode moves the page so the top of the selected cell is flush with the top of the viewport. Sometimes I even guess ('probably third in the list...') to avoid reaching for the mouse!\n"
