If you went that route, you wouldn't have to start a new server on a new port.  Instead, you could pass messages back and forth on the existing iopub channel, right?\n\nPresumably the IPython json<->backend message spec they are working on will make this even easier.\n"

Using the existing iopub channel would make much more sense indeed (think of multi-user sessions).\n\nThe advantage of this solution is that it requires IPython to do nothing it already does. This so true that this PR is actually silly: everything can be implemented as an external module or extension and there's no need to merge.\n\nCan you give me a link to the custom message type implementation?\n"

    "body": "@andreabedini: However this ends up at the end of the day, this work is very helpful, and I especially appreciate the notes you left over at `matplotlib`.  Just so I'm clear, is this work based off of matplotlib master, or my ipython-webagg-integration branch?\n\nOn first glance, while I think some of the IPython-specific stuff may ultimately live in IPython, there is too much code here that is copied and pasted from matplotlib that should instead be reused.  (`get_diff_image` for example).  The matplotlib version is more complex, of course, because it needs to work independently of IPython as well.  I think the real thing to do is to refactor what's in matplotlib now so it can be used independently of Tornado (something we need to do internally anyway to include matplotlib plots as part of an in-house Django application), and once that's done, maybe we have IPython hooks into that, but I would think those would end up quite small at the end of the day.\n"
