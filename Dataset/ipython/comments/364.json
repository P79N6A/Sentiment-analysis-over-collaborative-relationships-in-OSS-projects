    "body": "The rest of the PR looks good to me, and I tested it last night on IRC with @ellisonbg without any problems, so go for it.\n\nBTW, I just noticed when inspecting the code that we have still this code::\n\n```\n # A set with all forms of the exit command, so that we don't store them in\n# the history (it's annoying to rewind the first entry and land on an exit\n# call).\n_exit_commands = Instance(set, args=(['Quit', 'quit', 'Exit', 'exit',\n    '%Quit', '%quit', '%Exit', '%exit'],))\n```\n\nwith the new quit logic that can probably be cleaned up, since there are no magics anymore, nor any uppercase versions.  You might as well do it here since you're already fixing history stuff, and it's such a small change that I'm not worried about 'polluting' the merge with unrelated changes.\n"
