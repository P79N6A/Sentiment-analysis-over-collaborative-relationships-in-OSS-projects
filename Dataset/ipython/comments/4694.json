    "body": "The actual cause of the issue: `<br>` in your heading cells. For now, the fix is to either remove `<br>` from headings (better), or make them self-closing tags, with `<br/>`.\n\nYou have hit various bugs that turn this into 500:\n1. nbconvert is failing with a parse error in elementtree. It should handle this somehow, but I'm not sure what the right behavior should be.\n2. nbviewer only catches NbFormatError, instead of any error - this should be 400 when nbconvert fails, not 500.\n"
