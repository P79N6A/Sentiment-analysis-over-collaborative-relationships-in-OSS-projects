    "body": "Indeed, this is exactly what the HWM configurable is in the TaskScheduler, and merged just yesterday in commit e6ade7a70238c0e899c082c1051bfa3f3d915be2.  The default behavior remains unlimited, which has the lowest latency on a static engine set.  You must use the Python scheduler (the default) for this to be available, as it is not possible with the pure-zmq scheduler.\n"
