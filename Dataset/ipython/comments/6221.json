It is pretty important to have the same behavior.\n\nNo, we capture event on \"$(document)\", and event bubble up. Thus KeyboadManager handler is the last to treat the event. There is no reason for CodeMirror to react on that as it batched all its operations before.\nMarijnh will respond to you that codemirror is already triggerring event \"beforeChange\" if you want to cancel them.\n\nThinking about it, we might be able to go around that using our code, but it will be quite tough IMHO in case like @ivanov vimception mode.\n"
