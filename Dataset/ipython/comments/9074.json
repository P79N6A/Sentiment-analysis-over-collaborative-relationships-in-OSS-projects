I don't believe that this is being worked on currently.\n\nLet's check with some of the other IPython maintainers to see if this is a good issue to begin with. Currently, the issue seems to need some clarification from the team which tools (if any) should be deprecated/removed. Alternatively, there may be another issue better scoped for a new contributor to the project.\n\n@carreau, @takluyver, @minrk, thoughts?\n"

As @willingc Welcome !\n\nOf course we can give you pointers ! let us know if it's too detailed, or not enough details, it is often hard to judge if we are explaining right. \n\nIf you look at [this file, and this function](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/69d640651ae812032009e09bfa10f49e6ef076c8/IPython/utils/process.py#L64-L87) it seem to be not used anywhere in our codebase. \n\nCan you help us check that it is not used ?  It would mean searching through the codebase (with grep for example) and if it's unused we could go 2 ways:\n- Deprecating the function with a deprecation warning. \n- remove it directly. \n\nI would go with the second option. \n\nOnce this is done we can go through the other functions in the same file and check whether they are used. \n\nI'll also try to go through issues and try to find a more fun issue to work on !\n"
