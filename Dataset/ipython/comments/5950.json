    "body": "I was about to say I couldn't replicate it, but then I tried on Python 2, where the  `string` module is longer. I think it just exceeds the maximum number of lines we keep in the console, so the top bit is cut off before you see it. We could just increase the number of lines we keep, though that would only delay the problem until you do the same with an even longer module.\n"
