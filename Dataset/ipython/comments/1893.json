    "body": "Sweet!! Reviewing now... @ellisonbg and @jonathan-taylor, you'll want to have a look at this.  During an intense session this week with @jonathan-taylor using the notebook to debug some parallel statistical code, I kept making mental notes and thinking about how we could make the process smoother and easier.   Min and I then had a very productive, long discussion on Thursday where we bashed out all these ideas and this is the result.  I'm digging into the review now, but having your thoughts would be great too.\n\nOverall I think Min and I felt these changes would make big improvements to the fluidity of the experience and would open up good patterns for using the system, let us know what you think.\n"
