    "body": "I have also experienced this bug, and it makes my [extension](https://github.com/benjaminaschultz/base16-ipython-matplotlibrc) not terribly usable with ipython2.0. It works fine with ipython 1.0 however.\n\nI did some digging around in the source and it looks like the inline backend was refactored between 1.0 and 2.0 releases, and this behavior was introduced in [commit 78e198f21ec1f7c52e111a6682d28966a6fda14e](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/78e198f21ec1f7c52e111a6682d28966a6fda14e). It looks like something is probably overriding the rcParam for figure characteristics. I'll poke around and see what I can do.\n"
