    "body": "now that we have Haskell and Julia and  F# kernels (and so on...) it's not actually a safe assumption that that code blocks are going to be python. Indeed, this is one of the selling points for those languages (Julia in particular), that the are able to use all of our conversion machinery for their own purposes out of the box.\n\nI've opened a pull request to fix the reference to backticks, since now we just indent, but you can get backticks in the following manner:\n\nMake a new template file that inherits from `markdown.tpl` and overrides the input block.\n\n``````\n{% extends 'markdown.tpl' %}\n\n{% block input %}\n```python\n{{ cell.input}}\n```\n{% endblock input %}\n``````\n\nIf you call the above file `backticks.tmpl`, then just run\n\n`ipython nbconvert --to=markdown --template=backticks.tpl my_notebook.ipynb`\n"

    "body": ">  since one needs to do %language in the cell\n\nNot quite, the `%` magic commands are only known and handled by IPython kernels. IJulia, IHaskell, IF#, etc do not handle them, and when running with one of those, their users do not type anything extra in the code cells, they just write the code the same way we write python code for the IPython kernel.\n\nSo when you're handed a notebook, it could have come from any of those languages (and indeed, perhaps, another DSL not even on that list). The notebook document just captures what was written, what was sent, and what was received. But it was the running kernel that decided how to handle that input and what to send back. A heuristic would be to use pygments or something similar to try to infer the language of the code, but that would only be a heuristic.\n"
