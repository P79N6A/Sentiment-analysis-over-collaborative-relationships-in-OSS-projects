I don't agree with the solution though--it's even more brute-force than the Python 3 bug since it basically breaks the intended behavior (although I understand why a workaround was needed...)\r\n\r\nOn second thought, that *only* impacts code that was entered interactively.  It won't affect code from modules so I'm okay with that.  Then we're just left with the Python 3 issue which, unfortunately, impacts warnings regardless where they come from...."
