I'll go ahead and merge with those fixes.\n\nI should note that unicode execution did work just fine for me in newapp on all my machines prior to this change, as far as I could tell.\n\nIt would help if you would report test failures so I know they are failing :)  I did see a new error introduces by the recent docstring pass, but other than that (which has since been fixed), I have all parallel tests passing on Linux, Windows, and OSX in newapp.\n"
