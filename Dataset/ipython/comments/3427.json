Here are some relevant threads on tex.stackechange, one [on single $](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/510/are-and-preferable-to-dollar-signs-for-math-mode) and a [corresponding one on $$](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/503/why-is-preferable-to).\n\nIt appears that deprecating `$$` wouldn't be a bad idea, but single-`$` seems to be part of latex forever.  It's also true that the readability/usability penalty of going from `$x$` to `\\(x\\)` is pretty severe, and it gets worse with expressions that have parens, cf. `$(x+1)$` vs. `\\((x+1)\\)`.  The latter reads like line-noise.\n\nFinally, for typing mathematics-heavy text, there really is a major difference in usability between typing `$` and having to type `\\(` or `\\)`.\n\nI don't have an answer I like right now...\n"

Also, distracting opening and closing characters can have less visible color.  If you are planning to implement more editor support for markdown cell, I think `\\( \\)` is better.\n"

    "body": "The idea of creating a test case is to create the smallest possible input that reliably triggers the bug you are observing.\n\nIn this case, a single cell with the contents:\n\n``````\n```\n$x$\n```\n``````\n\nIs sufficient to trigger the bug in 1.1.0.  It's obvious to me what the problem is (because I wrote this code), and that's the the current code for recognizing math blocks is searching within code spans demarcated by ``` or four-space indentation, seeing \"math\" in the form of dual \\$s, and then failing to reconstruct the \"math\" after processing by MarkDown.  The @@0@@ is a side-effect of the `mathjaxutils` code when it is unable to restore math that it hid from the MarkDown parser.  My best guess for why this is happening is that the `replace_math` function is unable to recognize text that has been transformed by MarkDown's code formatter, and is therefore unable to restore any math that it modified.\n\nThe solution, then, is to fix the file: `ipython/IPython/frontend/html/notebook/static/notebook/js/mathjaxutils.js` so that it doesn't do math hiding on code blocks (demarcated either by four-space indentation or triple-tick code fences), because those are interpreted verbatim by Markdown anyway.\n\nSo instead of writing a test case, if you are up to it, you can take a crack at repairing my bug in IPython master for me :) by submitting a PR here?\n"
