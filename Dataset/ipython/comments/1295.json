I will add a note to the top of the intro page in this PR shortly.\n\nI've been thinking a fair amount about the parallel docs, and I think a from-scratch tutorial-style rewrite is necessary, leaving a detailed in-depth exploration of how things work separate.  Right now, these two goals of our documentation are much too entangled, detracting from the success of communicating at either level.  It's also true that the organization of the docs is principally unchanged from when it was originally written for the IPython.kernel code, which is becoming less and less appropriate as time goes on.\n"

    "body": "The principal reason these examples we have are not part of IPython.parallel is that they were both tossed together in an afternoon, to show that perfectly arbitrary engine interconnects are quite simple to implement as appropriate to your particular problem.  A bundled version would require more thought, and would have to take better care to make sure it gets addresses right in a variety of situations, and handle data serialization efficiently, etc.\n\nIt's also much harder to write a generic zeromq interconnect to be used as a library, because socket types really determine what is available to do.  The 'right way' to do this with zeromq is to create the network topology that is appropriate for you, which is not something that is easy to define in a library.\n\nFor instance, the bintree here uses push/pull connections to establish the tree, and a single PUB on root with SUB on everything else, whereas the previous all:all interconnect uses ROUTER sockets for direct addressing and PUB/SUB everywhere so that _all_ engines can initiate a broadcast.  Another example is the wave2d one, where nearest-neighbor connections are made.\n\nA great deal more thought would have to go into building base classes that are actually useful as something more than a starting point for copy/paste and adapt, which is exactly what these are meant to be.  The PyCon sprints will be a good time to visit this.\n"

I agree that making it generic at the right level is a hard problem that needs practical experimentations with realistic use cases and the sprint will be a great opportunity to collect some preliminary experience with this. Before merging I think it would be good to give some motivation for the spanning tree construct in the top level docstring (i.e. making commutative reduce operations scalable to hundreds or thousands of nodes by limiting network contention: the binary tree construct ensures that no single node will receive more than 2 payloads on it's incoming sockets at once).\n"
