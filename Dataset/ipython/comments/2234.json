    "body": "DPI is just matplotlib config:\n\n``` python\nmatplotlib.rcParams['savefig.dpi'] = 144\n```\n\nThe inline backend sets some of these values at load time (including DPI), since the matplotlib defaults don't work well in the notebook/qtconsole.  You can change these overrides to whatever you want in your config files, e.g.:\n\n``` python\nc.InlineBackend.rc = {\n    'savefig.dpi' : 144, # 2x\n    'figure.facecolor' : 'white',\n}\n```\n\nor change the matplotlib rc directly at any time.\n\n> P.S. If anyone has any knowledge of why qtconsole is limited to 72dpi, I'd love to hear it! It looks like crap...\n\nI don't know that it is limited.  This DPI number is totally specific to matplotlib figures, and if I recall it was chosen so that switching between SVG/PNG doesn't change the size of figures in the QtConsole (the notebook didn't even exist when this code was written!)\n\nIf Qt supports 2x rendering, then by all means, proceed with pull requests.\n"
