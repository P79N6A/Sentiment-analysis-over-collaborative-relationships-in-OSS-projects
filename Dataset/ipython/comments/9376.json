    "body": "FYI: the latest master commit of prompt-toolkit should handle the display of decomposed characters. Cursor movement (if you go backwards) is interesting. It's possible to insert characters in between the two unicode parts, making the double dot move from one character to the next. Also, the first backspace press will delete the double dot, the next backspace will delete the actual character. The same for delete. I'm not sure whether this has to be fixed, or whether it's actually a good thing.\n\nBy the way, my last patch for IPython would not necessarily be needed anymore after a new prompt-toolkit release.\n"

It looks like readline treats the combination as if it were a single character, so you can't manipulate the pieces separately. Maybe that's closer to what a user naively expects? But it's also more confusing when you're trying to work out what's going on...\n"
