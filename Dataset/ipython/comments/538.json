    "body": "I don't appear to have any problems working with UNC paths, the following work fine:\n\n``` python\ncd \\\\VBOXSVR\\local\ncd \"\\\\VBOXSVR\\local\"\nls \\\\VBOXSVR\\local\nls \"\\\\VBOXSVR\\local\"\n```\n\nand relative-path completions also work from inside the shared location.\n\nNote that after I cd into the share, any shell commands (e.g. `%ls`) will not work, because `cmd` doesn't support a UNC path as the working directory.  This doesn't seem to have anything to do with IPython though - running subprocess.Popen('dir') from a UNC path in Python fails with the same error.\n\nThe main issue is that _completions_ don't play nice with the backslash separator. This was a critical bug (#378) until I started testing, and realized that the same is true in 0.10, so it's not the regression I thought it was.\n"
