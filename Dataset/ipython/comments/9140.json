    "body": "See [this comment](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/136#issuecomment-3084010) for an explanation, but in brief, your list comprehension creates a closure over `obj`, and closures don't play nicely with dynamic evaluation (which is what embed does).\n\nThis has been a bug in `embed()` for years, and we haven't managed to find a solution. It seems to be a limitation of Python itself. I'll have another think, but don't hold your breath.\n\nClosing as a duplicate of #136, but feel free to keep using this thread if you want any more clarification.\n"
