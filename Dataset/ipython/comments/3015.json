    "body": "Hi, \n\nDidn't look deeplly into the code but : \n- test are failing, cannot load store magic anymore. \n- I would at least leave -z as a -d alias (not sure why you changed -z for -d I don't have any preferences) \n- You don't need to track the `_loaded` state of an extension. IPython do it by himself now.\n\nI don't use store myself, so I will wait fo other dev feedback.\n"

We like to keep our pull request queue moving.  If you aren't going to work on this right for a while, we would probably close the PR - you could always reopen it if you restarted work at some later point.  Let us know what you are thinking and thanks for your work. Cheers, Brian\n"
