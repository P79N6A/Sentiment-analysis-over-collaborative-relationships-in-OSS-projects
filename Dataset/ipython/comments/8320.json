    "body": "Thanks for the explanation.\n\nTwo suggestions for possible enhancement:\n\na. Sometimes software does the \"right thing\" but does not express to the\nuser the intent/rationale.  In this case, if there was associated\ninformation/help/etc. to make clear the reason why the whole toolbar didn't\nshow up was *because* of the file format, that would serve to get the end\nuser to understand the *why*.\n\nb. I wonder whether there is a common issue where someone opens up a file\nlike a .py file and intends to make it a notebook.  It could be that there\nis a \"convert to .ipynb\" option available when someone finds oneself in\nthis situation.\n\nThank you\nMark\n\nOn Sat, Jan 27, 2018 at 5:15 AM, Thomas Kluyver <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> If you open a text file (.json, .py, etc.), Jupyter shows a simple text\n> editor so you can view and change that file.
