    "body": "I think Brian miss-described the issue. \n\nThe question is that lots of user and kernels authors want to trigger info-request and completion request not only on tab, but on other keypress (most often requested are space, and dot) \nWe don't care about the regular expression to match token as in any case the all cell (and sometime even more) would be sent to the kernel for completion/inspection. \n\nBut we need a way to configure that in the frontend (here probably notebook)\n"

    "body": "Ah, that would be useful. Although it might still involve a regular expression: when dot is the keypress, \"1.\" should not trigger the function whereas \"object.\" should. Except in a language like Ruby, where you can call methods on a number. I guess the kernel could be triggered, but not respond... but it could generate a lot of extra communication, which could be limited by use of a regular expression.\n"
