    "body": "This is definitely important - I think anyone who's had a notebook more than a couple of screens long wants some better way of organising and navigating it. There are various different ideas for solutions, though: tables of contents, collapsible sections, tabbed notebooks, and probably others that I don't remember.\n\nWe need to think about how much we want to pick one (or more) and build it into the notebook interface, or to offer APIs that third parties can use to build these kinds of features. I think my vote would be to build some fairly simple navigation system ourselves, because this is such a common need, but leave more advanced solutions to others. I envisage something like a button that you click to get a drop-down table of contents (and obviously clicking on the headers there jumps to that point in the document).\n"

    "body": "I guess this would only apply to the IPython Notebook interface, so while editing the notebook?\n\nAsking because I see two main approaches:\n1. Implementing some fancy automatic table of contents with links in the notebook editor, possibly with the option of showing it from the menu and hiding it.\n2. Having some way of specifying in the notebook itself that you want a table of contents, probably at some specific location.\n\nI think there are use cases for both, but considering that there are more ways to use a notebook besides the notebook editor (as exported PDF, on the Notebook Viewer, etc) and a TOC could be implemented differently for each, I'd say that approach 2 would be most valuable.\n\nNot sure how to do this technically, but I could imagine some special construct in Markdown that is recognized by the editor and nbconvert, or perhaps a special TOC cell type.\n"
