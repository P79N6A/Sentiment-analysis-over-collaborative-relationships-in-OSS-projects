    "body": "No, I actually _love_ the visual sytling on stderr.  It's something I've wanted for _years_ on terminals, so I'm glad we can finally have it!! I was just wondering if it would be better to change the background shade from white to light red for stderr instead of changing the text color, as people may try to color the output themselves (like sphinx messages do).  It seems a bit safer to mess around with the text background than to override the text color.\n\nOnly one question: is it possible to reduce the amount of vertical padding between separate divs when we switch? Try this:\n\n<pre>\nimport sys\nfor i in range(8):\n    print i\n    print >> sys.stderr, i\n    sys.stdout.flush()\n    sys.stderr.flush()\n</pre>\n\n\nit seems there's too much vertical whitespace between divs.\n\nBut this is otherwise awesome!\n"

    "body": "Hey @minrk, what do you think of the background styling idea?  I was actually just using the notebook and also noticed that if you have a cell like\n\n<pre>\nx, y = 32, 42\nprint x\nprint y\n32\n34\n</pre>\n\n\nthe printed statements look indistinguishable from the input code.  If there are `Out` results, the prompt gives a visual clue, but if they are only print statements, there's zero visual cueing.  I was thinking whether to perhaps following the idea of shading the bacgrounds with a bit of CSS, using something like a faint blue for stdout and a faint red for stderr.  Regular Out (just like regular In areas) would remain white.  I don't know if in practice we'll find it distracting or not without trying, but it seems to me that we should help users visually disentangle things that are all logically distinct (at least stdout/stderr/other, leaving white for Out and fancy display results).\n\nWhat do you think?\n"

    "body": "I don't really like the aesthetic of coloring the stdout/stderr backgrounds.  If anything, we want to distinguish output as a whole from input, and it is somewhat unfortunate that `Out[]:` has a (super useful) logical meaning that prevents us using it to denote all output for a cell, because that's what I would really want from a UI standpoint.  I've played with various styles, giving various elements borders and backgrounds, and I really don't like any of them yet.  The lightest one that I dislike least so far, is a simple thin/light line separating the `In:` prompt, a la:\n\n<img src=https://img.skitch.com/20111008-dexp7drus7ss7t5n8smicnw7wp.png/>\n\nIt seems like what we really want is some indicator distinguishing output in general from input in general, rather than extra delineation of stream output from everything else.  In Terminal IPython, this is provided by the continuation prompts, and the In-prompt thin-border seems the most browser-appropriate way to do that.  I also played with styling the code area with a background itself, but it didn't feel right.\n"
