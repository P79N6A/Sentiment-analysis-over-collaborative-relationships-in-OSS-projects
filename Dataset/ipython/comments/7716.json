    "body": "Designing shortcuts in browsers is extremely annoying. Almost everything with modifier keys is already used for something else, and detecting most of the keys is tricky with different browsers and different keyboard layouts. I think all we can safely do is the letters with or without shift.\n\nIn this case, we reserved shift+j/k for extending the selection when we make it possible to select more than one cell. So ctrl+j/k was the logical choice for moving a cell. I'm still not convinced that moving a cell (swapping it with the one above or below) makes sense as opposed to cutting and pasting it, but I was outvoted on that.\n"
