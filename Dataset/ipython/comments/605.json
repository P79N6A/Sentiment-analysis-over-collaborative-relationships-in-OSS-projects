    "body": "I just realized this whole approach won't work.  Having the notebook server follow the cwd of a kernel won't work because different kernels can have different cwd's.  There will need to be a separate step that allows the user to select the cwd for the notebook server, which will be like the active \"project\" for the notebook server.\n\nBut, the entire reason we put in the user_expressions capability was to handle cases like this.  Originally, I argued that this was a bad idea for exactly the reasons you are describing.  But, Fernando and Evan wanted it, so it is there.  I am going to close this and open a new issue with the new design reflected.\n"
