    "body": "> Is there a way to just disable Autoawait?\r\n\r\nYes, `%autoawait off` but your issue is unrelated to autoawait, it is due to the fact that tornato 5 use asyncio as its main eventloop. \r\n\r\nSo far there is no solutions but to downgrade  `tornado` (and `ipykernel` ?) , see early in [this thread](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3397#issuecomment-376803076) for example.
