    "body": "Thanks, I believe the multiplexed mode had issues with the triplebacktick when people were using languages with $ where actualy it shoudl **not** be interpreted  as math, and when actually writing currency, Like \"I payed $4.5 for the coffee\" and boom, you are in tex mode.. But we will re-have a look. \nI guess we might need something a little smarter than multiplex mode\n"
