I really think of a repo with lots of display object, even maybe in IPython organisation but out of sync with IPython itself. \n\nOf course here audio seem pretty simple (an I have no objection to have it in lib), but where to draw the limit?\nWe embed wav and video. What about mp3 ? ogg? ogv? webm? We have a specific youtube class. Why not DailyMotion? Vimeo? Putlocker? NovaMov?\n\nThose would be nice, are independant of IPython version, and we should consider having **one** place where those could be added, with why not a monthly release (at least more frequent than IPython itself).\n"

Otherwise it can be extremely frustrating to use, as browsers cache media very aggressively (on Chrome, even clearing the cache won't play updated audio files whose name hasn't changed, you need to open a new incognito tab or flat out restart the browser).\n\n[This page](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/49547/making-sure-a-web-page-is-not-cached-across-all-browsers) has some suggestions on how to achieve no caching.
