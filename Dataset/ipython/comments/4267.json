    "body": "> Will clear all cell also remove the widget from widget area ?\n\nNo, the `clear_output` in `outputarea.js` currently just sets `$().html = ''`.  I suppose as an alternative to having a widget div, we could have smart `clear_output` logic that hides the widgets instead of removing them...  It would be  more difficult than it sounds, because I think we would have to worry about moving the widget controls to there \"original\" position in the output when new output is added.  In other words, with any of the easy solutions, the widget controls will always be at the top or bottom of the output area. :expressionless: \n\n**Edit: s/Yeah/No**\n"
