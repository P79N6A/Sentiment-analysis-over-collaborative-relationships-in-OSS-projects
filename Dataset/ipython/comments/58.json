In fact, I don't even have to change my locale, just the terminal encoding (at least on gnome-terminal).\n\nI'm marking it as confirmed but assigned to nobody, because honestly I don't know how to fix it right now, and I have other things on my plate that are more urgent for me.  We have others on the team that know much, much more about unicode than I do, so perhaps one of them can help.  And if you do find a solution, please send it in, it would be very nice to have this fixed.\n\nSorry not to be able to help more right now.\n"
