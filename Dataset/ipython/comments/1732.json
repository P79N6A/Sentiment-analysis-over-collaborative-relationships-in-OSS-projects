We don't want to have to have separate `%timeit` and `%timeit_cell` magics.  I do think that is important?  Are you saying you want to back pedal on that?  Or are you saying that you want to change the API for implementing those different magics.\n\nIn terms of the implementation, I think you should do whatever makes it easiest to accomplish this with minimal complexity and code bloat - even if it doesn't follow the IPEP.\n\nIf you feel like you don't have time to support cell magics with the same name right now, then let's come up with a design that will allow us to add that in later without breaking the API we put in place now.\n"

At this point, I'm getting the full test suite to pass again (modulo an occasional zmq failure that I only see intermittently and never in isolation, and which is unrelated to magics, so I hope it will get fixed elsewhere).\n\nNote that I _still_ don't actually have the real `%%cell` syntax implemented, but now this branch again has (to the best of my knowledge) a fully working IPython again.  So you can review all this code as a working unit.\n\nI'll now focus on getting the actual cell syntax working.  I think it should go comparatively quickly, considering that all the infrastructure is now in place.  But I've learned to be cautious with this beast now, so no promises :)  I'll work on that tomorrow.\n"

Here is a notebook that shows this:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/2779717\n\nBut I am running into a problem.  Currently, the return value of a magic is discarded.  This means there is no way of getting the result of a computation done in a cell magic back to the user.  I think this is something we are going to run into a lot as magics get more complicated and interesting.  Any thoughts on getting the return value back to the user?  This could also show up if a magic function returns something that has an interesting representation that displayhook/pyout should pick up.\n"

I'll try to write up some docs right away, but if it passes review, let's merge as I work on the docs, so we don't bottleneck the whole project on this.  I should note that as I mentioned to @minrk via email, I'm getting three failures in the `IPython.zmq` tests, all similar to this one:\n\n```\n======================================================================\nERROR: IPython.embed_kernel() is basically functional\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/nose/case.py\", line 197, in runTest\n    self.test(*self.arg)\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/zmq/tests/test_embed_kernel.py\", line 106, in test_embed_kernel_basic\n    with setup_kernel(cmd) as km:\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/contextlib.py\", line 17, in __enter__\n    return self.gen.next()\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython/zmq/tests/test_embed_kernel.py\", line 77, in setup_kernel\n    raise IOError(\"Kernel failed to start:\\n%s\" % e)\nIOError: Kernel failed to start:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\nImportError: cannot import name embed_kernel\n```\n\nI have no clue what can be going on, as I can indeed import `embed_kernel` just fine.  So on my box right now this PR does _not_ pass the full test suite, but it's due to this weird error which isn't related to any code I've touched recently.  I'm a bit stumped, I must say.\n\nI'd appreciate it if others can run the `test_pr` tool and report their outcomes, so at least we know how this is behaving on other systems.\n"
