    "body": "- First impression is that it seems too small, especially in comparison to the other items on that line. For example, it seems only 1/3 of the width of the text in the pull-down list, and maybe only 1/7 of the size of the \"IP[y] Notebook\" logo. Arguably, the kernel is the most salient factor to the user.\n- Perhaps the text in the pull-down list need not be displayed as one should be able to tell from the banner what kernel is being used. The pull down list could just be the down-arrow, with the named choices popup listed when you click it.\n- Perhaps the pull down list could be composed of the banner images (may be an issue for text readers though)\n- It is so small, it is hard to read... now with the menu behaving better on my cell phone, it looks good, but banner can't be read\n"

    "body": "@jdfreder it's more complicated than that in practice. It is common, for instance, to have a `32x32@2x.png` file, which is for display at 32x32 on 2x displays. A 64px image meant to display at 64px and a 64px image meant to display at 32px can differ, e.g. removing small features. Just because a small feature can be resolved in 64 physical pixels doesn't necessarily mean it should be displayed at 32 logical pixels.\n\nMaybe we don't go that far in the spec we provide, but it's not that simple.\n"

There's no point in having both 32x32 and 32x32@2x images, unless you want to be explicit about the image's resampling. Therefor I think all of the images should be 32x32@2 (named half of true resolution and suffixed with @2) _OR_ 64x64 (named after true resolution).  I still prefer the later, but don't have a strong opinion.\n"
