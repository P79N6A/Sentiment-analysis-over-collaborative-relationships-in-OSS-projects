    "body": "Hi, thanks for the proposal. \r\n\r\nThis is not a small update, it may be a couple of days/week of work. \r\n\r\nfirst you need to understand what's happend run a magic. \r\nFirst the user type `%magic`, it then goes to through `inputtransformer2` ( I believe) that changes it to `get_ipython().run_magic('magic')`. And that get executed. \r\n\r\nWe need to find a way to say \"this magic is async\" and change `get_ipython().run_magic('magic')` to `await get_ipython().run_magic_async('magic')` where `run_magic_async` is too be implemented. \r\n\r\nThe exact design is up for imagination but that is roughly the idea.
