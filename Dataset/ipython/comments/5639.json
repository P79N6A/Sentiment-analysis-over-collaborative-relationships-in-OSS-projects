    "body": "Hi\n\nI'm very glad to see this functionality making its way into IPython. I would just like to ask whether this design will allow me to batch run notebooks from the commandline? \n\nSo far I have not found a decent way to automatically run notebooks so that display hooks are run properly and that the resulting notebook is saved back to disk (with the fresh display output). This is very important to me as a [Topographica](https://github.com/ioam) developer as that project is now making heavy use of notebooks and we need this type of automation for testing purposes.\n\nMy unsatisfactory solution has been to hack my own copy of runipy (which was a very helpful starting point) to load our custom IPython profile, run a %load_ext command (with shell.execute) and then save the result on completion to a new .ipynb file.\n\nI am eager to see that this execute preprocessor can help me to avoid such hackery in IPython 3.0!\n\nThank you\n"
