Also, cells will almost always be deletable for the vast majority of notebooks, so I think having an unlocked icon will add clutter (as pointed out by @davidtrem).\n"

    "body": "In my opinion, the UI should provide:\n- an obvious way to see that a cell is locked without cluttering the display.\n- means for a user to query that the cell is locked if he doesn't recognize the visual indication.\n- it would be nice if the graphical interface to lock/unlock cells is within the context of the cell. A menu entry or button in the main toolbar is only the second best option.\n\nThe idea of showing a modal dialog box looks not very user friendly to me. The user has to perform the action that is prohibited (i.e. moving or deleting the cell) to find out that it is not possible. And he is penalized by having to click at the OK button (or having to wait).\n\nAn implementation maybe could look like this:\n- You can lock a cell by selecting the cell and going to a menu entry 'cell->lock'. \n- The cell is then locked and a symbol appears next to the cell. \n- If you hover over the lock symbol a tooltip appears that explains that the cell is locked. \n- If you click on the lock symbol the cell is unlocked and the symbol is removed.\n\nThis is an unsymmetrical operation, i.e. it is more effort to lock a cell by going to the menu than to unlock a cell by clicking on the lock symbol. As locking a cell is probably not used very often, this seems reasonable. \n"

    "body": "I think maybe I wasn't clear on how the notification works. This notification (in the upper right corner) appears when the user tries to delete the cell, and will fade after a few seconds:\n\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/83444/4413904/3a3f117e-450d-11e4-8c1a-db5c8e3f6c69.png)\n\nIt is only if she clicks the notification for more details that the modal dialog appears. So the user is never penalized by having to click anything: they only click if they want to. Also this only prevents cell deletion; moving cells is totally fine. I think the term \"locked\" isn't really appropriate anymore, even though I know that's what I used in my original pull request.\n\nAnyway, though, I'm not convinced that the notebook should actually offer an interface for making cells deletable vs. undeletable -- it should just provide a way of letting the user know why the cell isn't being deleted when she tries to delete it. There should never be a case where a cell is accidentally set to be undeletable; it should be a very intentional action on the part of the notebook creator. So at least to me I don't see it as a problem that the cell is undeletable, and the user doesn't know until she actually tries to delete it.\n\nIn my mind, the intended use case is more that the metadata attribute will set by notebook extensions or nbconvert preprocessors or the like (or in rare cases by editing the metadata by hand). I think otherwise that sets a precedent for every metadata attribute that is supported in IPython core to be able to be set or unset via the notebook UI, which is probably not something we want to do?\n"

    "body": "Personally I don't think non-deletable requires a special signaling. Non modifiable probably, but here the intent is really to prevent accidental deletion/split/merge. The rest of the operations are still possible so most of the time people would just not even remark cell are not deletable. We can add (at load time should be enough) the non-deletable css class to the Dom, which would allow to change style with custom css if needed (like when editting). We could also have the border of the cell flash red for a short amount of time when trying to delete/merge/split to indicate which cell is not deletable. But this property of the cell do not change how you interact with it.\n"
