    "body": "Normally I prefer to use full names for parameters instead of single characters (with the exception of mathematical functions), but I think `e` is pretty standard across the board amd I have no problem continuing to use it in the widgets.  I took a _quick_ look elsewhere in the widget code and it looks like I used `e` in a couple of other places too.  Thanks @weichm \n"
