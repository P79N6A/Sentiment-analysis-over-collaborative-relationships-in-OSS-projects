I've used the method as shown in the thread above rather than %%capture magic in this example:\n\nhttp://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/hugadams/pyparty/blob/master/testing/REGRESSIONTESTS.ipynb\n\nI'll work on a solution, if anyone else starts working on this, can you let me know so as not to duplicate effort.  I'm not too familiar with the ipython source, so would likely not find the canonical solution.\n\nThanks\n"
