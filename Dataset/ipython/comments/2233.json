    "body": "Well, I think we need to figure out what sort of drag and drop behavior we want in the Qt console.\n\n**Current behavior:**\n- Text selections anywhere in the Qt console window or any other window can be dragged and dropped. If the location of the cursor at the time the text is dropped is in the current editable cell the text is inserted at the cursor location, otherwise the drop event is ignored.\n- Files may not be dropped.\n\n**Desired behavior:**\n- Drag and drops of text selections should remain as they currently function. (No changes)\n- Files should insert their filename (which @Carreau gave some good reasons why).  Dropping multiple files should result in all of their paths joined with spaces.  _Q:_ Should the filenames be inserted at the cursor location before the drag was started, or at the cursor location when the drop event happens?\n"

    "body": "Okay I've split this up into two commits.  The first should replicate the existing drag and drop behavior by using the actual drag and drop events. The second is the new behavior for filenames.\n\nI've changed the file drop behavior to always insert the filename at the cursor position before the drag was started (i.e., we don't update the text cursor position during the drag).  This seems reasonable to me.\n\nThe last issue we still need to sort out is the format of the filenames.  A regular terminal, for example, escapes the filenames (e.g., `' '` -> `'\\ '`) and inserts multiple filenames separated by a space.  I'm leaving more towards something like  `\", \".join(map(repr, filenames))` in Python.  What are your thoughts?\n"

Ubuntu 12.04, (Python 3.2.3)\n\n### Verification\n\nI have verified the following drag and drop events.\n1. Drag and drop of text from within the application continues to work as before.\n2. Drag and drop of text from outside the application works.  Text is inserted at the location of the mouse cursor at the drop.\n3. Drag and drop of files from outside the application works.  Filenames are \"posix quoted\", joined with `', '`, and inserted at the text cursor location when the drag was started.  The quoted format is compatible with both `open(...)` and `%run ...` for both standard ascii filenames, unicode filenames, and filenames containing quotes (e.g., `ᛦᛚᚳᚢᛗ'\".py`).\n\nHere is part of a sample log from one session:\n\n``` python\nIn [12]: '/home/bfroehle/Desktop/ᛗᛁᚳᛚᚢᚾ'\"'\"'\".py'\nOut[12]: '/home/bfroehle/Desktop/\\xe1\\x9b\\x97\\xe1\\x9b\\x81\\xe1\\x9a\\xb3\\xe1\\x9b\\x9a\\xe1\\x9a\\xa2\\xe1\\x9a\\xbe\\'\".py'\n\nIn [13]: print '/home/bfroehle/Desktop/ᛗᛁᚳᛚᚢᚾ'\"'\"'\".py'\n/home/bfroehle/Desktop/ᛗᛁᚳᛚᚢᚾ'\".py\n\nIn [14]: %run '/home/bfroehle/Desktop/ᛗᛁᚳᛚᚢᚾ'\"'\"'\".py'\nHello\n\nIn [15]: open('/home/bfroehle/Desktop/ᛗᛁᚳᛚᚢᚾ'\"'\"'\".py').read()\nOut[15]: 'print(\"Hello\")\\n'\n\nIn [16]: files = '/home/bfroehle/Desktop/ᛗᛁᚳᛚᚢᚾ'\"'\"'\".py', '/home/bfroehle/Desktop/TODO.txt'\n```\n\n### Todo\n\nManual testing should be done in a Windows environment.  In particular we should check that files with unicode names and containing quotes are inserted in a usable form.\n\nIn addition we should test in Python 3.\n"
