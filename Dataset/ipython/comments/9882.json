    "body": "Well,I start the ipcontroller on the Centos 7,and the ipengine is started on the Windows Server R2. The Internet of the Windows is  automatic.I want to develop a program which is running stable for serveral  days using the ipengine and the client.I found that if the Internet is interrupted the ipengine will lose heartbeat.And the ipcontroller cann't get the ipengine's ID.Eventhough I set the hearbeat period a large number.It seems that the Internet cann't be interrupted while the system(contains ipcontroller and ipengines)is running.So what should I do to solve the problem or restart the ipengine using it's original ID? Thank you~\n"

    "body": "If there internet goes out for several hours, you will need to set some configuration to allow for that level of failure:\n\n``` python\n# ipcontroller_config.py\nc.HeartMonitor.period = 60000 # ping every minute\nc.HeartMonitor.max_heartmonitor_misses = 720 # allow 12 hours of interruption before considering an engine gone\n```\n\nNow, the engine also notices heartbeats and shuts itself down if no heartbeats arrive for a while. You can disable this entirely:\n\n``` python\n# ipengine_config.py\nc.EngineFactory.max_heartbeat_misses = 0 # disable engine-side heartbeat check\n```\n\nAll that said, it may be easier to make your workload resilient to engine death, and just let engines disappear and get new engines on the workers when connectivity is restored.\n\nWhat sort of work are you doing with IPython parallel? It may be that setting the `retries` flag to allow resubmitting tasks to new workers if an engine disappears is all you need.\n"
