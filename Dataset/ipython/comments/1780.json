In order to avoid it being doctested, simply add the `@skip_doctest` decorator from IPython: `from IPython.testing.skipdoctest import skip_doctest`.\n"

Edit that file, and you'll find at line 148 and following, this:\n\n```\n<<<<<<< HEAD\nhave['pygments'] = test_for('pygments')\nhave['wx'] = test_for('wx')\nhave['wx.aui'] = test_for('wx.aui')\n=======\n>>>>>>> Ensure that no tests are attempted if numpy or rpy2 are not present.\n```\n\nChange that to read:\n\n```\nhave['pygments'] = test_for('pygments')\n```\n\nthat is, simply remove the `<<<, ===, >>>` markers as well as the two `wx` lines, and save\n\nThen type\n\n```\ngit add IPython/testing/iptest.py  # or appropriate relative path\ngit rebase --continue\n```\n\nand you should be done.  You'll have to force-push your changes since this rewrites history:\n\n```\ngit push --force\n```\n\nand the PR will update with the new code and will become mergeable again.\n\nSorry for the confusion with the conflict, it was actually caused by my fix :)\n"

I think this could be very confusing for users. But maybe it has to do with rpy2 and not with this (for the rest wonderfull!) rmagic?\n"

    "body": "There is an issue about this in rpy2 for a while, but not yet resolved (https://bitbucket.org/lgautier/rpy2/issue/44/numpyrecarray-as-dataframe). But there is a possible solution mentioned in the issue with np.records.fromarrays.\nI tried it with al little hack in Rpull:\n\n``` python\n def Rpull(self, line):\n        outputs = line.split(' ')\n        for output in outputs:\n            if self.r(\"is.data.frame({0})\".format(output))[0]:\n                self.shell.push({output:np.rec.fromarrays(self.r(output), names = tuple(self.r(output).names))})\n            else:\n                self.shell.push({output:self.Rconverter(self.r(output))})\n```\n\nand this lets me do:\n\n```\nIn [5]: %R print(datar)\n  x   y z\n1 1 2.9 a\n2 2 3.5 b\n3 3 2.1 c\n\nIn [6]: %Rpull datar\n\nIn [7]: datar\nOut[7]: \nrec.array([(1, 2.9, 'a'), (2, 3.5, 'b'), (3, 2.1, 'c')], \n      dtype=[('x', '<i4'), ('y', '<f8'), ('z', '|S1')])\n```\n\nSo it seems working (it only returns a record array, and I would prefer a normal structured array). I suppose this is a too simple hack (as I don't understand all the complexity of the code), but maybe you can do something with it.\n"
