    "body": "@onceuponatimeforever - Assuming you are using bash (it's the default now on OS X), you can add `/usr/local/share/npm/bin` to your PATH for your current bash session with this command:\n\n`export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/share/npm/bin`\n\nSince you would like that command to be executed every time you start a shell session, you need to put it in your bash startup file, called the profile.  The easiest way to that is to create the profile file (if it doesn't exist yet) with the `touch` command, then edit it using your default text editor:\n\n```\ntouch ~/.bash_profile\nopen ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\nPut the export command on its own line towards the bottom of the file, save it, and exit.\n\nAnother option is to upgrade your homebrew and npm installations, since I believe homebrew now links node package installs in `/usr/local/bin`.\n"
