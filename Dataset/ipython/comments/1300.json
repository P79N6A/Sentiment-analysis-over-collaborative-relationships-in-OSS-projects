If we go this direction, the collapse input functionality could be in that menu.\n\nThere is another issue related to CodeMirror.  I am been having a really difficult time with hiding and showing the code mirror editor area.  Basically any changes which affect how it is displayed are causing glitches that make the notebook unusable.  With Markdown cells, this has become an \"almost show stopper\".  I am trying to get a handle on what is going on, but it is really difficult to track down - the bugs are subtle, transient and inconsistent.  We currently have a number of very fragile hacks put into place as workarounds.  But, with this background I am extremely hesitant to do anything that would hide/show/collapse the CodeCells.\n\nI think we absolutely need this functionality, but I think we need to wait until these things are sorted out.\n"

    "body": "I'm torn on this one.  On the one hand, many thanks @Carreau for continuing to work on improving the UI, we really appreciate this!  But as @ellisonbg mentioned, the prompt area will probably be necessary to trigger the appearance of some UI element like a local cell-level menu.  It's one of the few areas where it seems possible to activate UI elements without consuming additional vertical space.\n\nFurthermore, we want to carefully consider a few things:\n- now that we almost have structural cells (#1331), it becomes possible to consider folding entire sections, not just the internal content of one cell.  We should consider that right now, so we end up with a consistent design throughout.  In particular, how do we distinguish between folding the content of a cell itself (what you have implemented here for code cells) and folding the hierarchy that sits below a cell (to fold entire sections, for example).\n- I don't think we should merge folding support until that information can be persisted.  Basically, if I save a notebook with a bunch of cells folded, I'd like to see them folded again when I reopen it later.  Otherwise, if it's an action that has to be enabled every time you open a document, I don't find it too useful.\n\nThat means we need to consider where to store that information, which will be per-cell.  I think it should be part of the cell's metadata, but that must play also with the point above about folding both contents and hierarchy, both of which would need to be stored.\n\nSo I definitely think this is a worthwhile idea, and it's great to have you working on it! But we need to think this one through very carefully, so it 'clicks' cleanly with the rest...\n"

    "body": "Non, problem, I just wanted it for some time, and it was just a quick draft, I didn't planed on keeping the action on the input prompt. One idea would be to show the action below the prompt only when the cell is more than 2 or 3 lines, because is does not make sens to collapse a one line cell. \nA bout the persistance of the information, I agree.\nI doesn't have much time to work right now, and for know it's hard to keep on with all the change happening (I'm desesperatly hop to be able to test the vim keymap of the notebook), so do I close the PR, or leave it open as a reminder of what have still to be done ? \n"
