    "body": "We have ControlG and ControlC to dismiss. Probably I can add Escape as well. (Need to verify this, but it looks like readline accepts escape.) See here for the default shortcuts: https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/master/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/emacs.py#L483\nhttps://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/master/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/vi.py#L1272\n\nThe reason that ControlC is not working is probably because of this: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/terminal/ptshell.py#L135\nThat key binding is always active. That means that this will override the default ControlC implementation for the search. Better is to add a filter to make this only handle ControlC when the default buffer is active:\n\n``` python\nfrom prompt_toolkit.filters import HasFocus\nfrom prompt_toolkit.enums import DEFAULT_BUFFER\n@kbmanager.registry.add_binding(Keys.ControlC, filter=HasFocus(DEFAULT_BUFFER))\n```\n\nI will verify whether the Escape binding can be added next weekend. I also noticed a few minor bugs in the latest prompt_toolkit release. (Thanks to several people for testing/reporting) So, I'll have to push a new bugfix release very soon as well.\n\nJonathan\n"
