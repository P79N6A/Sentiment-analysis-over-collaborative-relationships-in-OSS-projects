    "body": "- Fixed the video (it was a Python 3 issue), and squashed the commits to avoid a change on the huge base64 line.\n- Use IFrame instead of HTML with a manually defined iframe tag.\n\nThe description for Filelinks in this notebook actually says it operates recursively, but last time we ran this, we had nothing for it to recurse into.\n\nI agree that explaining a bit about displayhook and the display function makes sense, but let's deal with that in a separate PR.\n"
