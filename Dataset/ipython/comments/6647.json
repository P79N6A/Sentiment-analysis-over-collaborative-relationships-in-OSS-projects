    "body": "No need to apologize! It's nothing more than the inevitable price of progress. Keeping the API stable will make maintaining EIN easier for me, but sometimes you have to break things before they can become more awesome.\n\nFrom your comment and a quick perusal of IPEP 27 I think getting EIN to work with IPython 3 will be much easier than getting it to work with IPython 2. I don't see a need to add a redirect as you suggest, rather I would like to have a URL I can query to get the current 'version' of the REST API. Something like \"api/version\". That is probably simple enough that even I, enfeebled coder that I am, could probably great pull requests for IPython 2.x and 3.0 code bases. Good learning opportunity in any case.\n\nThanks for the response!\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: \"Min RK\" notifications@github.com\nSent: ‎10/‎7/‎2014 11:59 PM\nTo: \"ipython/ipython\" ipython@noreply.github.com\nCc: \"John Miller\" millejoh@mac.com\nSubject: Re: [ipython] IPython 3.0 breaks compatibility withemacs-ipython-notebook (#6647)\n\nSorry about breaking things.

There has been no official handover from takafumi-san as he has disappeared from the face of the internet (or at least has stopped answering emails). A number of individuals have found their way to my fork which at the moment works reasonably well with IPython 2.x. I work as time permits to improve functionality.
