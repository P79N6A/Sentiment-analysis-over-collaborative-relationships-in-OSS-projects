    "body": "Thanks Scott for opening this ticket and your work on this feature!\n\nLet me elaborate a bit on the two main use cases in the context of\nSageMath [1]:\n- Like many other Python projects, SageMath is using Sphinx as\n  documentation system, and ReST as documentation format\n  (with a few specific roles like: :trac:`2334` :wikipedia:`Jupyter`).\n  \n  A very nice feature of the Sage notebook is that all the Sage\n  documentation can be browsed \"live\", as notebooks that the user can\n  interact with. Having a ReST to Jupyter notebook converter would go\n  a long way toward the addition of such a feature to Jupyter.\n- A lot of people in the Sage community that write tutorials,\n  educational material, experimental log books, etc for distribution\n  as notebooks actually write them as ReST document. The rationale for\n  this includes:\n  - Many such documents are likely to eventually become part of the\n    Sage documentation anyway.\n  - It's text based, and therefore plays well with version control and\n    collaborative editing.\n  - It's simple to make such documents \"reproducible\": just include\n    the output, and run tests as we do for our usual documentation (in\n    our case with `sage -t foo.rst`).\n  \n  Personally that's the last remaining bit in my workflow for\n  transitioning to the Jupyter notebook for my teaching (see\n  e.g. [2,3]), and I'd love to be able to do this next fall.\n\nPS: this is one of the features planned in the OpenDreamKit[4]\nproposal. Taking some lead advance does not hurt :-)\n\n[1] http://www.sagemath.org/\n[2] http://nicolas.thiery.name/Enseignement/Agregation/\n[3] http://nicolas.thiery.name/Enseignement/Agregation/Notes-rst/\n[4] https://github.com/sagemath/grant-europe/blob/master/H2020/OpenDreamKit.rst\n"

    "body": "I think we do want this to exist, but some pieces aren't quite clear about how to do it:\n\n> Does it go in nbconvert, so it's a pandoc-esque conversion to _and_ from notebooks?\n\nMy guess is that the answer is: \"probably, but not initially.\"\n\n> Do we implement it with docutils/sphinx via custom NodeVisitors, etc.?\n\nThat would bind it to rst, which might be a useful first step, but would _not_ be appropriate for something we would integrate into nbconvert. I'm sure lots of people would find it useful, so I think it's a worthwhile project, even if we end up going in a more generic direction in an official Jupyter project.\n\n> Do we use something like [dexy](http://www.dexy.it/), which has the building blocks for almost everything asked for here, and we can provide plugins and/or wrappers to make particular patterns easier, and fill in any existing holes?\n\nThis is most attractive to me, currently, since it seems like the most amount of functionality relative to work we have to do and maintain.\n"

    "body": "This will be mostly personal opinion, but I think yes, wee are interested. There used to be a `.rst` importer in nbconvert, but it was not used enough, so we removed it. \n\nWe are also currently splitting the repository in many sub-repository, and I suppose this would be better suited for https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_nbconvert , and while `.ipynb -> *` seem to be the goal of nbconvert, a `* -> .ipynb` could be, for the beginning a separate repo. This would allow much more freedom for the new code to be pushed directly on master, no PR, lazy review while you iterate quickly. \n\nThere si definitively  an interest with sphinx integration though. \n"
