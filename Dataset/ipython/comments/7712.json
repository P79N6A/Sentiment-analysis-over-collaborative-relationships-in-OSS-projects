    "body": "I agree that, for the time being, is better to describe the dependencies and improve the error message. \n\nIs it possible to detect if LaTeX is installed before trying to convert the ipynb file? If that is possible, Ipython would be able to give a helpful error message instead of throwing an error about a very specific file. In my case, I thought that another package had installed a LaTeX distribution because `pdflatex` seemed to work. I suppose most of the errors Ipython users encounter, in this context, are due to not having installed a LaTeX distribution. Therefore, an early detection of this issue would benefit most users.\n\nMaybe, a reasonable compromise is to add the traceback to the HTML error page but not show it by default (because it is too long and uninformative.) After clicking on some text such as \"Want to see the traceback?\", the traceback could be shown. However, if early detection of a missing dependency is possible, the main message in the error page should convey that.\n\n@takluyver \n\n> User data includes the notebook content itself. And while the server isn't supposed to save that information, you don't know when you send it an HTTP request what it's going to do with it.\n\nBut do you mean snooping as @Carreau suggested? Otherwise, we know what the server will do with that request.\n\n@Carreau \n\n> Everything. If we can PDF, why not HTML, RST, markdown, and even Just Latex. \n> Getting Pandoc installed is not easy...\n\nI don't think HTML or RST are needed in a conversion service because they are already available in the notebook itself. Markdown and LaTeX conversions can be useful, though.\n\nIf the server gets hacked, everything is possible. However, the likelihood of getting hacked is low enough that it shouldn't be something that prevents people from launching a service. Instead, security measures should be taken (promptly installing security updates, opening only the ports that are required, enabling a firewall, installing only the needed applications, SSL, etc) \n"

I don't have the slightest idea about Windows, though.\n\n@Carreau No, I meant to say that nbconvert already does many useful conversions, so we don't need a conversion service implementing the same again.\n\nRegarding security concerns, that is a lot of work but it is almost mechanical work. Against intelligence agencies, there is nothing you can do. The NSA breaks SSL-encrypted connections routinely now. The amount of work in \"etc\" depends on the particular requirements of the site, but in this case, due to the simplicity of the service, the additional needs are not too demanding.\n\nGoogle is target of industrial espionage on a regular basis, and if some foreign intelligence agency wanted to steal information, there is almost 0% chance that their chosen attack vector is going to be an ipynb->pdf service. They know that technologically savvy people won't upload sensitive information in such a careless manner. Furthermore, if they wanted to obtain Norvig's data, they would infect his laptop and then every additional security measure would be pointless.\n"

Missing mistune - the pip install is broken but luckily the conda install became available today.\n2. Missing pandoc. Not available at all in pip or conda so search the web for an 18 MB Windows installer.\n3. Missing pdflatex. Where does one get this for Windows? There's something called MiKTeX which is a 163 MB install, and isn't clear that it will do this PDF export.\n\nSo far, that's 1 broken pip install and uninstall, 1 successful conda install, and 2 massive downloads from random third parties before we get close.\n\nI just don't know how anyone could maintain this across a load of users' machines, and this is just to output a file as PDF. Many other software packages manage PDF export without any dependencies.\nIsn't there a better way?\n"

    "body": "I am having similar issues as blokely for windows 7.\nI am behind a Firewall at my work and need to get special permission to install software. A number of my colleages and myself are trying out the Anaconda distribution. we were hoping it would be the only thing we would have to install.\n I guess  we need a total of 3 addons, mathjax, pandoc,  (these two are documented in the detailed install instructions) and third MiKTeX which is not in the install instructions. you don't find that out untill you go to pandoc page. getting the notebook and nbconvert to work flawlesly on windows behind a firewall is not easy!\n"

    "body": "Someone could write an nbconvert PDF exporter that either goes directly to PDF using [reportlab](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/reportlab) (which is now pip installable on Windows), or produces HTML and then converts it to PDF using a tool like [wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/) or [weasyprint](http://weasyprint.org/). If it went well enough, we may even include it in nbconvert. But I don't think that's high enough priority that we're going to work on it ourselves any time soon.\n"
