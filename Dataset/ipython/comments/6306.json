I actually have things ready for a subdirectory creation button but that seems to require some discussion. \n\nOther things that require discussion would be changing the text (the upload text currently states that it is for notebooks and not any file). \n\nFor removing vs keeping the box when not replacing, I don't have a strong opinion. I just picked one. I do think adding another button though starts to confuse the UI a bit more and only removes on clock in the case they don't want to upload the file at all (or no clicks if they just ignore the upload box). \n"
