Another issue here suggests that a proposed CSS change may help this problem.\n\nOn a related point, showing tracebacks that have more than, say 20, function calls in the stack trace is not useful. Consider having a expand/collapse hierarchical tree object that the stacktrace could use. Or maybe for any large output there should be a \"Show more...\" link to make sure that notebooks can render. (Large outputs don't seem to be a problem in the static nbviewer. I accidentally printed a student's 500 page nbviewer-rendered notebook with stacktrace the other day...)\n\nThe problem of large outputs making a notebook unloadable can happen in any Jupyter kernel, so isn't limited to just IPython.\n"

    "body": "We have talked before about putting in some safe guards to prevent large amounts of output from even reaching the notebook (or other) frontends. The way we handle large outputs right now is very problematic. Some points:\n- The kernel itself should manage this - it should refuse to even send output beyond a certain point.\n- The kernel should save large output somewhere (probably to disk, but that may even be a problem beyond a certain point).\n- The the kernel should send something that indicates that large output was generated and provide the user with some way to view it, or at least tell the user how much output was generated and where it was put.\n- All of this should be integrated with the output scroll/collapse in an intelligent manner.\n\nI have changed the title of this issue to reflect this more general issue.\n"
