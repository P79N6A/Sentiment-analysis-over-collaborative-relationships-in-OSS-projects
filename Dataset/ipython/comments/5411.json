    "body": "How did you update / install? You installed with setuptools, and it clearly computed gnureadline as a dependency. I wonder how it failed to install it.\n\nThe third-party readline package is basically deprecated. It relies on easy_install's bad behavior to override the standard library, which is impossible to accomplish with pip. As pip adoption increases, readline has become essentially useless. The solution has been to rename the package `gnureadline`, so there are no name conflicts.\n\nThat said, I wish we could express gnureadline as a dependency at install time without setuptools adding a duplicate check to entry points. I'm not sure how to do that, though.\n"
