Specifically: after the output from `ls`, it is still the case that no input prompt is printed. But now, if the user presses \"Enter\" (which is a common response to not seeing a prompt), then the prompt will be printed. Before the break at 4953f2d, the prompt was printed immediately after the `ls` output, without a need to press Enter.\n"
