For example, macOS Terminal.app can display a whole bunch of information in the title, including the working directory, path, the active process name, and so on - but I'm no expert on this topic. From a usability perspective, you shouldn't change the terminal title if you know you can't revert it. For me this is not a big deal because I can change the setting, but I feel that if I had to explain this behavior to the students in my beginner's Python course this would definitely sound like a bug don't you think?"

    "body": "Vim uses CST/SSI CRT/SRI termcap that are non standard (can't even find it on google), which require detection of the termcap of the current terminal via infocmp, and them mapping the correct escape sequences. That is a complex endeavour for a (small) return. These capabilities might also be available only when using alternate screen, which we are not.\r\n\r\nFeel free to send a PR that fixes bugs it or implement the capability, but we're going to keep that close as we have no intention of working on it seeing the cost/benefits ratio.\r\n\r\nThanks."
