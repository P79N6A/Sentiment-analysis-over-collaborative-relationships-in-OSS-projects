There was a consensus, although no-one felt strongly about it.\n- There are a lot of other sites that have a similar distinction between 'raw content', and 'HTML display' - files on Github, Bitbucket, other pastebins, the matplotlib gallery, etc. If we handle the HTML URL for one such site, people would expect similar behaviour for lots of other sites. Maybe someone should write a little package that knows about all these sites and handles the transformations.\n- There isn't a clear right answer for multi-file gists: you could take the first file, the first file matching some condition, the concatenation of all the files...\n"
