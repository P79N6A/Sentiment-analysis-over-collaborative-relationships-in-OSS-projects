    "body": "1. I've no idea about shortcuts and installation on Windows. For release, we'll build a binary installer which you download and run, maybe that makes a difference.\n2. Do you get any sort of error message or anything?\n3. %cpaste will let you paste in using the paste option in your terminal (Powershell or whatever). %paste just tries to grab text directly from your clipboard.\n4. It's there, but in an extension. Do `%load_ext storemagic`, or add 'storemagic' to the extensions list in your ipython_config.py file.\n\nThanks for the feedback. For future reference, it's a good idea to take questions to the mailing list, and use this system for specific things we need to fix or improve. If in doubt, start on the mailing list, and we might ask you to open an issue about something.\n"

    "body": "Hi,\n\nOn Fri, Nov 25, 2011 at 4:08 PM, gigaimage\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\n> I am new to IPython. Please let me know If I need to post this type of questions on user list from next time.\n\nYes, questions like this should be posted to the list, to which I'm\ncc-ing this reply so you can find it later in the archives.\n\n> My system config:\n> Windows 7 64 bit, Python 3.2, IPython 0.12 (dev).\n> Installed all dependencies: PyReadline, PyQT (MSI installer), PyZMQ, pygments as per the instructions on installation web page.\n> \n> I see following issues. Not sure what's wrong and where.\n> 1. Installation never install a .bat file or desktop shortcut to launch IPython. So I use ipython3.exe from Scripts folder in PowerShell.\n\nDo you have setuptools installed?  As you can see on the installation\ninstructions, on windows setuptools is a requirement:\n\nhttp://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/install/install.html\n\n> 1. I don't know how QT console (ipython3-qtconsole.exe) looks like because it never worked.\n\nThere's a screenshot of it on the front page of the website, and the\ndocs describe it in detail:\n\nhttp://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/qtconsole.html\n\nIn order to help you out with why it's not running for you, we'd need\nto know what specific errors you are getting.\n\n> 1. I just want to have a basic understanding on how to use PASTE and CPASTE.  Correct me if I am wrong.\n> \n>      First I copied the following code from python cookbook online to the clipboard.\n>             random import *\n>             randBinList = lambda n: [randint(0,1) for b in range(1,n+1)]\n>     Next, typed %cpaste% on Ipython, so I see a \":\" prompt awaits.\n>     What's next? CTRL+V? shortcut key doesn't work. Do I use PowerShell paste menu item?\n\nI don't know why Ctrl-V doesn't work, try the menu item perhaps.  Note\nthat for simple pasting from the clipboard, if you don't need to copy\nmultiple times, you can use %paste.  %cpaste allows you to keep\npasting until you terminate input with a line containing only '--',\nbut for a one-time paste, you can use %paste.\n\n> 1. Didn't find Store command in %lsmagic% list? No longer there in 0.12?\n\nIt has just been added back a few days ago, but you need to enable it\nin your config file:\n\n# A list of dotted module names of IPython extensions to load.\n\nc.InteractiveShellApp.extensions = ['storemagic']\n\nI'm thinking perhaps we should add this one back by default, it's an\nextremely useful thing to have in everyday use...\n\n> On a side note: I followed Jeff's tutorial (http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/series?name=CnluURUTV) ,\n> though its bit old (v0.9), I highly recommend this to new comers, please cite this on IPython doc webpage).\n\nGood point, I added more prominent links to the videos in our front page.\n\nCheers,\n\nf\n"
