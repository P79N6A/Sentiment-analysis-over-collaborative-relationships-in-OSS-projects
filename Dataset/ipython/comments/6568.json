    "body": "I agree that this is just one more thing where we want a way to persist some kind of config or state from the frontend. And for users running it locally, I suspect that the server-lifetime-only persistence of the last kernel you picked will be a minor but persistent annoyance, because each time you start a new notebook server, you'll forget that it's reset to the default default. So I guess I'm -0.5 on having a special memory thing for this particular setting without coming up with a proper, general mechanism for storing frontend config.\n\nWhether the remember-last-choice behaviour itself is a good thing, I'm not sure. I can see @Carreau's argument that interfaces trying to be smart can be annoying, but I can also see the argument that users benefit from this automatically, without having to look into a config box.\n\nI'm not sure how much this was actually discussed at the dev meeting. My memory is more that Fernando said he wanted it, and then we moved on to the next topic.\n"
