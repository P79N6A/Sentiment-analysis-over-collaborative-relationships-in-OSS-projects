    "body": "The issue probably comes from the fact that the DOCTYPE header stuff is (I think) file-wide, whereas in the notebook SVGs are inlined, so it's probably ignored.  Looking at the file itself, even my browser's syntax highlighter sees the ]> as text, and _not_ part of the markup.  That said, the browser does still draw it correctly when viewed on its own.\n\nThis is another tic for using separate URLs for images, rather than inlining everything.  Not all SVGs are going to be able to be inlined, and the code available for inlining is a subset of the code available to separate requests.\n"

    "body": "That's not clear enough, since there's no indication that we don't actually support regular SVG files.\n\nWhen loading from a file, it should be easy to extract the svg tag, rather than the full xhtml document.  Should we do that?\n\nA simple example that works with the given file, at least:\n\n``` python\nfrom xml.dom import minidom\n# parse full file into dom object\nx = minidom.parseString(svg_src)\n# get svg tag (should be 1)\nfound_svg = x.getElementsByTagName('svg')\nif found_svg:\n    real_svg = found_svg[0].toxml()\nelse:\n    # there wasn't an svg in the file\n```\n\nAlternatively, the append_svg method could extract the actual svg tag:\n\nhttps://github.com/minrk/ipython/commit/a73f7c37e866422ffa583f3d378abe7447ebcc91\n\nEither of these changes allows the example file to display properly\n"
