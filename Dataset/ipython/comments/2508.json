    "body": "This is similar to https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/688. The problem is that when saving a mpl figure using `bbox_inches='tight'` not all artists are taken into account. Using `bbox_inches='tight'` is the default behavior of the notebook to avoid white space. This can be confirmed by adding `bbox_inches='tight'` to the  savefig call i.e.  doing `p.savefig('prueba.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')`. This results in the same clipping in the png file. It should be possible to add the table to the bbox_artists using \n`fig.savefig('prueba.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight', bbox_extra_artists = [ the_table ])` but unfortunately it seems like the get_window_extent method on the table does not work as expected.  \n"
