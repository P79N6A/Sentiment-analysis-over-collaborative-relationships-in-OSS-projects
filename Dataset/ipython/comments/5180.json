    "body": "I think this issue should be closed. Multi-cells selection is possible since Jupyter 4.1. https://blog.jupyter.org/2016/01/08/notebook-4-1-release/\n\nAfter selecting multiple cells as described below, you can press `X` to cut the cells or `C` to copy. Then move to the cell below which you want to see the cut/copied cells and press `V`. \n\n> Multi-cell selection is an often requested feature. The new version of the notebook includes the ability to select multiple cells and perform commands on them. Not all cell commands can be performed on multiple cells yet, but the basic API exists and can be used for extensions.\n> \n> To select a contiguous block of cells while in command mode, press Shift-J or Shift-K (also Shift-Down or Shift-Up) to extend and shrink the selection. Or you can hold Shift and left click on a cell to select a range of cell. The selected cells can be visually distinguished from the unselected ones by their soft blue background.\n> \n> Many cell commands operate now on the selected cells. For example, merging cells (Shift-M) used to merge current with the cell below it. It still does that for a single selected cell, but now it also merges all selected cells together.\n"
