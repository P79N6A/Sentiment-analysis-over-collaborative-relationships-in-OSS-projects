    "body": "I should also note that the polling logic in the HB channel is unnecessarily complicated, and actually wrong in some places.  There is a comment interpreting `poll()` returning an empty list as a zeromq bug, which it certainly is not, and the code appears to follow this misunderstanding.  Since this bug is actually critical to getting the terminal-frontend working, I will at least fix that part over in #864.\n"
