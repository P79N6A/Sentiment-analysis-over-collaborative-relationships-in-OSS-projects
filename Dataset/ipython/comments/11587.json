    "body": "Not an issue with IPython or Jupyter.\r\n\r\nI was registering a callback function with the library that was getting garbage collected because I wasn't keeping a reference to it. The difference I experienced between the notebook and the shell was that depending on how I split up cells of execution garbage collection occurred sooner or later. If it occurred sooner the C library attempted to call a non-existent function and crashed.\r\n\r\nSolution: keep a reference to the callback."
