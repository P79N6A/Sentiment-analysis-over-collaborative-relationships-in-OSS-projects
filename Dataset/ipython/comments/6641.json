It will allow faster development. It would in particular also allow the magic to be used in IPython 1.x and 2.x.\n"

    "body": "Any importable file or module can be an ipython extension, if you create python package and publish it on PyPi, let's call it `lookfor` people can do `$ pip install lookfor` and then `%load_ext lookfor` on ipython and boom, they get the magic. \n\nFor the code I suppose you can create your own repository on github. To learn how to package you can refer to [PyPUG](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/). In your case it should be relatively simple as it is a single file.\n\nHow does it sound ? Don't be afraid of creating an unfinished package, and announce it on python ML, people will probably come try it and propose some fixes. We are also availlble if you need help, but we do encourage people to publish things on separate repo.\n"
