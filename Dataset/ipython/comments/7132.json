    "body": "According to https://github.com/docker/swarm/pull/181 and the [Travis Blog](http://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-12-17-faster-builds-with-container-based-infrastructure/), if we set sudo to false (and by extension stopped using sudo) we'd get faster workers. Getting sudo (or a pseudo-sudo) is in the works for them, but not there yet.\n\nThe nice bit about this is when we start splitting repos up, they don't _all_ need the dependencies from sudo. If Travis goes down the path of docker though for builds though, we could probably offer a base container that has the dependencies we need... Maybe I should jump into those convos and set up a base image for us...\n"
