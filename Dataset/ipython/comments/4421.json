    "body": "I'm -1 on this, and would prefer the consistency of always using .ipython if it exists, and allowing for .config/ipython for XDG fan-folks\n\nI don't understand who decided that XDG is a good idea, and why, and it's not even that widely used. I'm pissed at Matplotlib always barking at me about it. Why should one POSIX system behave so much different from all others? There's not a good reason. It's OK that some people want to use XDG, so we should allow them to, but FORCING everyone to use it is just wrong.\n\nI think it's stupid to make me have a different set of dot files on FreeBSD and on Debian.\n"

I'd just like something simple we can tell users about where their config files are.\n\nWe don't even use XDG properly - the files we save in the IPython directory are a mixture of at least Config and Data, with probably bits of Runtime and Cache information as well.\n\n(Though even the current scheme shouldn't differ between FreeBSD and Debian - we follow the XDG convention on all POSIX platforms except OS X)\n"
