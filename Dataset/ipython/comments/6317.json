    "body": "The reason it doesn't is that exporting to PDF requires latex to be installed. There's no way we can specify it as a dependency of a Python package, and even where we can, we don't really want the notebook to depend on all of latex. Adding the option dynamically when we know it's possible might work, but I guess it may be tricky to test that all the latex stuff we need is installed.\n\nThis may be somewhat easier if someone wrote an alternative PDF exporter using something like reportlab, or one of the various html to PDF tools.\n"
