    "body": "After writing the above, I checked my assumption that slides are mapped to top level head lines, and I found that I was wrong, and that there is a separate slide attribute that has to be set. Once I set the slide attribute everything worked as expected! \n\nThe problem was that I probably related to the fact that I was interacting with the ipython server through emacs-ipython-notebook, which I realize causes various problems with the resulting ipynb file.\n\nIn any case I can live with the idea of postprocessing the notebook in a webbrowser and then setting the resulting slide page attributes, so I'm closing this bug.\n"
