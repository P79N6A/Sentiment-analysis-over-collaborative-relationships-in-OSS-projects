Eventually we'll be running fully on py3, so I want to make sure we're not setting ourselves up for a restricted test suite there.  Anything we can start doing to make the doctests more py3-compatible?\n"

    "body": "Good question. The `u'abc'` syntax in the output from the doctests is incorrect on Python 3. Generally, I've got a workaround where you write `{u}'abc'`, and then apply a `@py3compat.u_format` decorator to transform it. But these doctests involve a lot of `{foo}` style formatting, which would all have to be changed to `{{foo}}` if we wanted to use that.\n\nThe same code is covered by proper functional tests, so I decided to keep it simple and skip the doctests in Python 3.\n"
