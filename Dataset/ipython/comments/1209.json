    "body": "Sorry, the `%result` part of the docs (and even the `%result` part of the code) just weren't properly updated from the old version in IPython.kernel.  They were updated to function with the new interfaces, but not much attention was paid beyond that.  The docs rightly state that `%result` currently maps directly to `dv.get_result()`, which guarantees an AsyncResult object.\n\nIt should be trivial to make `%result` match the docs by adding\n\n``` python\nif self.active_view.block:\n    result = result.get()\n```\n\n[here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/extensions/parallelmagic.py#L103).\n\nBut honestly, I'm not convinced of the value of having the `%result` magic at all, since it really doesn't do anything beyond `return dv.get_result()`\n"
