If you're new to git and not sure how to try this out, it's a small enough change that you can just edit your \n`IPython/nbconvert/templates/latex/sphinx_base.tplx` file directly. Just find the line (it's probably line 362 for you) that reads\n\n```\n((( conditionally_center_output(insert_graphics(output.pdf_filename[:-4])) ))) \n```\n\naround line and remove the `[:-4]`\n"
