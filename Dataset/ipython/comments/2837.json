    "body": "Tab completion of filenames is a feature that I'd definitely like to keep. Maybe we could be smarter about where it completes (e.g. only if you're near the start of the string), but a) interfaces that try to be too smart are annoying, because you don't have a good mental model of what they'll do, and b) it's probably hard to do with readline, as Min says.\n\nIn the terminal, as far as I know, we can't distinguish between the user pressing the tab key and pasting text that contains tab characters. As a workaround, you can do `%paste foo` to dump the clipboard to a variable `foo` (note that that's designed for Python code, so it will strip things like `>>>` prompts). If you're working with data from a spreadsheet, pandas also has a `read_clipboard` function to load it straight into a `DataFrame`.\n"
