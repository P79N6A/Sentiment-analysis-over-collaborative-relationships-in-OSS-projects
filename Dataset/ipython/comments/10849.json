    "body": "```\r\n> foo = %%timeit -n 10 -r 1 -o time.sleep(1)\r\n> res = 1 + 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou're not supposed to use a cell magic this way; so this is actually not running a cell magic, a cell magic can't be assigned; the `%%` have to be at the beginning of the line. What you are doing here is running the line magic `%timeit` on `sleep(1)`, as the line magic cannot have setup code. Then you are running `res = 1+2` outside of the timeit magic.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to see that is to issue a `hist -t` after runnign your cell; it will show you the translated history : \r\n```\r\nfoo = get_ipython().run_line_magic('timeit', '-n 10 -r 1 time.sleep(1)')\r\nres = 1+1\r\n```\r\nInstead of the following you would expect: \r\n```\r\nget_ipython().run_cell_magic('timeit', '-n 10 -r 1 -o time.sleep(1)', '1+1')\r\n```\r\nWhat you meat to do was:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [12]: %%timeit -n 10 -r 1 -o time.sleep(1)\r\n    ...: res = 1+1\r\n784 ns ± 0 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 1 run, 10 loops each)\r\nOut[12]: <TimeitResult : 784 ns ± 0 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 1 run, 10 loops each)>\r\n\r\nIn [13]: foo = _\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe documentation should be more precise and we should try to catch %% in the middle of the line.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "I see, thanks for the clarification (and for the hint to use `%hist -t`). So it seems that this is less an issue with iPython and rather a problem of my limited understanding of its functionality. Having said that, from the standpoint of \"familiar\" use of command options, I would assume that I can pass the name of the object directly to the cell magic for assignment, something like\r\n```\r\n%%timeit` -n 10 -r 1 -o foo time.sleep(1)\r\n```\r\nand analogously `%timeit -o bar time.sleep(1)` to the line magic.\r\n\r\nBut I guess you guys have considered that option and decided against it for some reason. So, maybe it would make sense to add an example for assignment using `-o` to the docs for both of the options? I guess that would avoid some confusion around the issue (and reduce the number of people opening github issues ;) )."

    "body": "> But I guess you guys have considered that option and decided against it for some reason\r\n\r\nYou might be giving us too much credit there. ;-) For line magics, it's neater to have a return value, but that's not really workable for cell magics. I don't think we can extend it to allow `-o foo` though, because parsing command-line style syntax mixed with Python code is error prone at the best of times.\r\n\r\n@Carreau it seems like a bug that `foo = %%timeit ...` is allowed as a line magic. Do you think there's a reason for that, or is it just accidental?"

We should at least have a warning. \r\nWe can have a look at `-o foo` as we are doing it in other magics. The issue here is that the option would differ between the cell and line magic. \r\n\r\n"
