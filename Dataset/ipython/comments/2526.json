    "body": "What do you mean by modified quite heavily?  The original file has two things:\n1. a generic subclass of pexpect.spawn that exposes setpgrp\n2. a utility function specific to the gridmon project\n\nAll I did was delete the function, as it makes no sense to keep it (trying to call it would just result in an ImportError).  The class is unmodified.\n\nBut in #2520 @andreabedini said this doesn't even fix the issue (which I don't fully understand), so I think we should probably just close this and try something else.\n"
