    "body": "> Ok, but I don't think that's a fair comparison to %load, as I can use that remotely loaded script directly, while I can't use the .ipynb directly like this.\n\n%load downloads a file and sets it as input, whereas the curl call I made downloads an entire notebook, which is immediately available at the dashboard.  If you want to clobber the current notebook with the downloaded notebook,\nyou can simply append `> CurrentNotebookName.ipynb` instead of `-O`, and refresh and you will be set.  There isn't really an analog for `%load` that does much more than the curl call.\n\n> I'm glad you agree it's easy to add an upload from url button, as Brian suggested it might be 'out of scope' for the roadmap you designed?\n\nOut of scope doesn't mean it won't get done - it just might be more appropriate to come from someone else (or while we are stuck / annoyed by our current task), particularly for small, self-contained tasks like a simple 'upload from url' button.\n"
