I thought it was something I was missing as it is what is shown on the main documentation in the picture: https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_images/ipython-6-screenshot.png\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I have found out a shortcut that is somewhat working (in my settings ?) which is ctrl+o. This actually starts a new line (with the 3 dots '...'), except the cursor is staying at the same place and I need to press the arrow key to put the cursor on the new line. This is not the best but still better than the backslash!"

    "body": "There is a trick you can use. You can use parenthesis in the beginning of the code-block you want to write, when hit enter-key, it will automatically add lines to your command meanwhile the parenthesis in the beginning is not closed. Before executing you must remove parenthesis. Another common way it's if you have a block defined by after ':', everytime you hit enter-key it will add conforming the identetion of the block (which is nice if you need to write and execute a for loop). If you add a line with any of these manners and in the final line you hit enter (and this line is empty and all parenthesis previously closed if any) it will execute the whole block you wrote without problems. You can try and discover many other ways. But it's possible. You don't have to argue with one-line convention if needed a multiple-line execution or block one"
