    "body": "The closure is actually straightforward:\n\nThe lambda function is referring to the c_args in its parent scope via a closure.  To fix this, simply rename the one declared in `__init__` to something else (b_args), then when the lambda function is called, it will look in globals, and should be fine (with this change, your script works for me).\n\nAs for general and performance issues: we are in the process of completely replacing IPython.kernel (with IPython.zmq.parallel, see the 'newparallel' branch on GitHub), so I am afraid that we aren't likely to fix much there.\n"
