We could remove some of the less popular editors for now (I've never even heard of Crimson edit or GNUclient, for example). Since it doesn't do anything without user intervention, it can't cause a regression, so I think it's OK not to have tested with every editor on the list.\n\nI'd call the module `IPython.lib.editorhooks`, but others may have better ideas.\n"

    "body": "Good point, @Carreau . Yes, ideally I'd like to see this support the Qt console as well. In practice, I don't know how easy that is, because of the frontend/kernel separation. As I understand it, when you call %edit in the Qt console, the contents of the file are transmitted to the frontend for it to open an editor. Obviously that's useful if your kernel isn't on the same machine as the frontend, but it means it's tricky for anything in the kernel to affect the editor.\n"

    "body": "My solution to getting run-time configurable %edit in the qtconsole is a bit of a hack, but it works (I tested emacs and textmate).\n\nBasically, I modified `ZMQInteractiveShell.edit` to send, in addition to the filename and line number, the \"template\" string that specifies how to invoke `Popen` for that editor.\n\n`IPythonWidget._edit` receives that template, and uses it instead of the configurable.\n\nIt seems a bit hacky to me. The problem is basically that the implementation in the TerminalInteractiveShell with the hooks and stuff is _totally_ different than the qtconsole.\n\nFor instance, `TerminalInteractiveShell` has an `editor` instance variable, but `ZMQInteractiveShell` doesn't.\n"

    "body": "I think we need to have a more careful work through the code that implements %edit over ZMQ - at the moment, it's rather complex because there's an entirely separate configuration system for editing in the frontend.\n\nIn the meantime, I'd be inclined to merge this on the grounds that we shouldn't let aiming for perfection delay improvement. I'm a bit concerned about changing the messaging format to add `editor_template`, though. On the one hand, the contents of payload dictionaries aren't in the spec. On the other hand, there may well be clients like EIN that expect it to remain constant.\n\nSo, while I realise that it's going back on what I said before, I'm now inclined to leave the ZMQ-related changes out, and merge the rest of this. Any thoughts?\n"
