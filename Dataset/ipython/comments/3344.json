    "body": "That makes sense - does it depend on the shell, though?\n\nUnfortunately, it looks like it would be tricky to implement, because `os.getcwd()` always returns the real path to the working directory. We'd have to track a sort of 'virtual working directory' of the path you'd followed to get there.\n\nIn the meantime, you can always go one step back with `cd -`. See `cd?` for more options.\n"

    "body": "I can only test this under three shells, so I can't say if it is shell dependant, but bash, csh, and windows cmd.exe all report the current working directory in terms of the symlink followed to get there rather than the absolute path. For these cases the behaviour of `cd ..` makes sense, since it is just taking one step up the \"virtual\" path. On the other hand, IPython's `cd ..` is also consistent, since it always reports the current working directory as the absolute path -- it's just inconvenient.\n\nThanks for alerting me to `cd -` I was not aware of it. Practically speaking this is a big help, but I can still imagine situations where backtracking `cd ..` would be preferable.\n"

Try it (in your shell)!\n\nNow you are correct, most shells I've seen default to the logical option whereas IPython seems to only support the physical option.\n\nI suppose we could add this functionality to IPython's `cd`.\n"
