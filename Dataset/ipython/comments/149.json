The core calls the hooks calls the core calls the...  Thus, as we are refactoring the core, we are removing hooks wherever possibly.  For result_display this happened when we refactored the display hook this summer.  To get the functionality back, we simply need to create a simple API on the display hook object in the core and then have the extension call that API.  In the long run, we want to come up with a nice generic way of handling hook type things on our classes, but we don't need to get this worked out before we fix result_display.  I just added this to my todo list on the Google doc...\n"

    "body": "There are a couple of issues that are driving the reconsideration of the hooks:\n- The global nature of the hooks are the biggest issue.  We want to move to a model where the different components of the IPython core have their own extension points that are local to those classes and encapusulated therin.\n- The notion of an IPython extension point goes far beyond the current \"hooks\" model.  As we have been refactoring the core, we are introducing other non-hook APIs that are meant to be part of the developer API for the core.\n- I would say that at the current time, it is not yet clear what all the extension APIs should look like and we haven't spent much time thinking about it.\n- It is very possible that the CommandChainDispatcher would be one way we would offer extension APIs.  We would need to think about how to fit that into the more encapsulated context of a class.  I have even thought about using traits/traitlets to declare extension points.\n\nI should mention that the other part of this picture is that there are still some aspects of the display hook and payload system that we need to work out.  We are currently using our new payload system to bring back things like the result of page calls and inline graphics.  Some of this stuff may end up being moved to the display hook.\n\nWhile there are lots of larger issues still being played out, I don't see any reason we can't add back some sort of simple extension API for the display hook that the pretty printer extension can use.\n"
