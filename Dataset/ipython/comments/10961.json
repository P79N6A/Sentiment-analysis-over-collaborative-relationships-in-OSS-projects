    "body": "Same problem. Just found out that the problem comes from the new version of ipykernel, which is 4.7. In my case, as a temporary solution, simply downgrade the ipykernel to 4.6.1 will solve the problem. Hope this works for you too.\r\nHope the issue will be fixed at upcoming versions of ipykernel. A small bug but quite annoying."
