    "body": "I don't know if this is related, but I just upgraded from version 5.something to 6.2.1, and tab-completion has become much less useful when typing a file path.\r\n\r\nBefore the upgrade, I got only proposals for file paths when pressing tab with my cursor at the end of the string representing a path.\r\nIn 6.2.1, the path-completion proposals are lost in a whole list of python functions and objects.\r\n\r\nAs I had the habit to rely on tab-completion to explore my filesystem, this is a bit annoying."
