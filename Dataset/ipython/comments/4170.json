Well I do know that this will probably have a lot of other minor and major implications, so I am not expecting a yes on that, but figured I might as well ask.\nThanks for the info though, is really appreciated.\n"

If this is still relevant I would suggest this issue to be reopen on the above cited repository. \n\nThis will allow us to keep the number of IPython issues smaller and focussed on IPython. As currently there is an extremely high number of opened issues , it make it really hard to find if a problem is actually known, or going to be worked one. \n\nFeel free to reopen if need, for the time being I'm going to close this. \n\nThanks.\n"
