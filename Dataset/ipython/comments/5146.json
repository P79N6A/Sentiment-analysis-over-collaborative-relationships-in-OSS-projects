    "body": "@ellisonbg made all of the changes we talked about and some more.  For future reference the events do fire backwards, which is okay because the last two events are always in the right order (the focus event is fired twice).  This is ready for another round of human based testing and a review.  I've removed all of the `console.log`s this time because I'm feeling confident that this will be the final iteration (as far as the bugs are concerned).\n\n@ivanov You'll probably want to take a look at overriding the `should_cancel_blur` methods for registering your own exceptions to codemirror unfocus events.\n"
