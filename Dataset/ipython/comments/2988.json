    "body": "I see the same on Ubuntu 12.10, but the Magic menu does get populated with\nall the magic commands, so I've considered it harmless. It would be good to\nget it cleaned up, though.\n\nA quick search suggests that a few projects have run into this - it seems\nto occur when you register the same action in the menu multiple times.\nWhich we do, because of the 'all magics' submenu. Unfortunately, the only\nsolution I've yet come across is not to register actions multiple times.\nArguably the 'All magics' menu is too long to be useful anyway, so we could\ndisable it.\n\nOn 28 February 2013 09:52, the-moog notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> On starting qt-console on Ubuntu 11.10, Python 2.7.2.

(ubuntu 13.04, pip installed) The all menu doesn't scroll at all in Ubuntu 13.04, and I like the organized view better. A search dialog, or pop-up list box, would be better, I think.\n"

If this is still relevant I would suggest this issue to be reopen on the above cited repository. \n\nThis will allow us to keep the number of IPython issues smaller and focussed on IPython. As currently there is an extremely high number of opened issues , it make it really hard to find if a problem is actually known, or going to be worked one. \n\nFeel free to reopen if need, for the time being I'm going to close this. \n\nThanks.\n"
