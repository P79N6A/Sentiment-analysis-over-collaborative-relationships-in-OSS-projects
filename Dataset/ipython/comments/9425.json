I'll fix that.\n\nFixed: https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit/commit/a9877111ed3c8ab1e2988e2a2432d6929ae3b3ec\n\nEdit:\n\n```\nCtrlC DOes exit the mode, but does not immediately change the cursor blinking mode which is confusing.\n```\n\nEdit2: I thought this was a bug, but it's not. There is an Emacs binding `ControlC >` and `ControlC <` which indents/unindents the selected region. Because of that, the first `ControlC` doesn't do anything yet, because it doesn't know yet what will follow.\n\nIf you want `ControlC` to take effect immediately, but because of that disable the indentation key bindings. Add the following:\n\n``` python\n@handle(Keys.ControlC, eager=True, filter=HasSelection())\ndef _(event):\n    event.current_buffer.exit_selection()\n```\n"

    "body": "FYI: last two weeks, I've been working a lot on improving and simplifying the code for the prompt-toolkit key bindings. Especially for Vi mode. There is now a clean separation between a binding that defines a Vi operation and a binding that defines a Vi text object or movement.\nThe good thing is that many more Vi bindings are working. Further, it becomes much easier to extend a key binding. It is easy to say: \"I want a binding for Emacs selection mode\", or \"I want to define a binding to create a Vi text object\".\n\nThe bad thing is that in order to make this simplification, I had to put an `editing_mode` attribute in the `CommandLineInterface` class. This variable defines whether Vi, Emacs (or maybe even something else) is active. So, the `enable_vi_mode` for the `KeyBindingManager` argument isn't used anymore. I keep it to make sure that it doesn't break anything, but it means that this is simply ignored.\n\nI hope to finish it during the next few days/next week. Then I'll push a new release numbered \"1.0.0\".  Where the major version stays as long as no backward-incompatible changes are done. (Hopefully for a very long time.) When finished, I open a new IPython pull request.\n"
