    "body": "Let's see... (haven't tried this in some time...)\n\nOK, yes I got it to work now. First I upgraded to the last version available on CheeseShop. After this I had some errors because I accidentally used a different virtualenv in the two shells (maybe that was the cause of my earlier problems as well). After I realised this and activated the same virtualenv in both of them, I started the notebook server with:\n\n```\n ipython notebook --profile=server\n```\n\nthen I opened some notebook (so that it starts a kernel) and started a console client (on the same machine) with:\n\n```\nipython console --existing --profile=server\n```\n\nAfter this, everything worked - I was able to modify data structures in either the notebook or my terminal and the changes were synced.\n\nThanks for the help!\n"
