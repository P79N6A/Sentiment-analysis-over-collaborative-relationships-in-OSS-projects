If you commit on push to your repo, this PR will update. \n 3 - We try to encourage people to go to then end of their PR and understand what they are doing. We will gladly spend a few hour explaining you instead of doing ourselves.\n 4 - Though, if you don't have time, don't want to work on it anymore, tell us and we will finish it.\n\nI'll make some comment inline ! (maybe a bit later though, I'm at a hackathon in London, and have other people around ! )\n"
