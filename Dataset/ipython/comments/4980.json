    "body": "Although it doesn't work entirely reliably, and we've always said kernel code shouldn't know about frontends, I know that pandas does use this to display different reprs to the notebook and the Qt console (specifically, it doesn't display the HTML reprs if parent_appname indicates that the kernel was started by the Qt console). So I think we'd need to give it a deprecation cycle if we do want to remove it.\n"
