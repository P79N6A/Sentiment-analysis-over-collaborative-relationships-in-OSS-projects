    "body": "`~/<tab>` still works, and shows the correct completions as the symlinked path - but `run`ing a file or `cd`ing to a directory with respect to the symlinked path seems to work fine back in a (symlinked /home) Ubuntu land. Let me confirm on FreeBSD... **confirmed**\n\ngrepping through the source - I only see home_dir being used in core/interactiveshell.py core/logger.py core/magic.py utils/path.py. Logger just uses the name, and gets it from iteractiveshell, which calls the utils/path.py:get_home_dir method I've modified here. magic.py also just uses the interactivelshell's home_dir, so I think that's all the places where it's used, aside from the related tests.\n"
