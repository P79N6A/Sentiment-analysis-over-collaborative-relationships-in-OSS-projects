    "body": "Thanks for the PR.\n\nFor wide screens, the line lengths in the notebook are waaaaaaay longer than the usual typographical recommandations. But as you state, that is probably something we have to live with. Although @minrk has custom CSS that adds a symmetic cell margin to the R side (can you post a screen shot Min?) so he has shorter lines. That might be something to think about.\n\nBut even with that, we will still have long lines in the notebook on modern wide screens...\n\nThe traditional \"justification\" for left justify is this:\n1. For longer lines of text, fill justify makes it difficult to detect where your eyes are in reading the paragraph. The left justify provides just enough irregularity to guide the eye as it moves down the lines vertically.\n2. Browsers still aren't really good at implementing fill justify from a typographical perspective (word spacing, hyphenation, kerning).\n\nThe media query solves 1 but not 2. I am probably still +1 on this change always.\n\nHere is a great link that goes into the algorithmic details of justification in the browser and shows a nice example of how the implementation in browsers doesn't cut it:\n\nhttp://www.bramstein.com/projects/typeset/\n"
