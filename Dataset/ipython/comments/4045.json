If I have a file `path.py` in my working directory and say `import path`, the system-wide package is ignored, and the local file is imported. However, when I create a file `os.py` in my working directory, Python still imports `/usr/lib/pythonX.Y/os.py` and not the local file. What makes the difference between these two cases?\n"

Local modules generally override anything in site-packages (non-stdlib), and even most of the stdlib - so you can make almost anything (IPython, numpy, etc.) not importable by making your own local `.py` files.  This is a general issue / feature of Python.\n\n`path` is the most common dependency of IPython that users choose to conflict with, so perhaps we should check that `import path` gets the `path.py` module, rather than a local name collision.\n"
