On the one hand, we want to keep the\ndeveloper's workflow as simple as possible, as well as the size of the\ndownload repos.  On the other, we don't want to get kicked out of\ndebian/ubuntu (and possibly fedora, I don't know if they have the same\npolicy), and we really appreciate the packaging work you do.\n\nCan you point us to how other projects deal with this same issue?  Do\nthey commit both unminified and minified versions together?\n\nWould a hash/mention of the upstream version we minified suffice?\nThat seems to me like a good compromise: instead of putting in the\nactual sources, we can put in a text file with a url and git commit\nhash of the version we actually used.  That's as good as the source\nitself, and it saves us the duplication of having those unminified\nsources around all the time.\n"

It's causing real troubles for the distribution packagers, and they really do a lot of work that we benefit from.  Good debian packaging has a huge impact for us (many downstream distros, massive testing infrastructure applied to all packages, ...), so I want to make sure we do our best to work with them.\n\nAs per the FAQ above, we're basically risking getting kicked out of debian, and that's not an outcome we want.\n"

At this point we just said F-it, let's use the menus branch.  We will absolutely switch back to stable as soon as menus are in a release.\n\nSo it sounds like the stable release ones are no problem, and we don't need to do anything there.  We can ship the jquery-ui sources in the unminified dir while we are not tracking a stable release, and then dump them once there is an acceptable ui release.  How does that sound?\n"

    "body": "> the difference is that you can still edit the source in the case that jquery closes down and deletes all their stuff from the servers or prune their git branch after deciding that they don't like the menubars after all.\n\nThe same goes for tornado, readline, zmq, and Python itself.\n\nAs I said above, \"with the exception of our use of dev jquery-ui\".  I am convinced by your arguments that we should ship our jQuery-UI snapshot, at least until there is a stable release.  Once there is a stable release, the difference between shipping totally unused code and shipping a version string is nonexistent.\n"
