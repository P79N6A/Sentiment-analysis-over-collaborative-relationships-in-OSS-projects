We are not talking about a general undo like the one with which Mathematica struggled for years ( I think they fixed it this summer in Mathematica 10), though this would also come in handy. \nThe obvious way to do this would be to change undelete_backup and undelete_index variables in notebok.js to be some kind if FIFO buffer (list of fixed maximum size).\nMaybe I will give it a try and make a pull request though I am not very fluent in javascript\n"
