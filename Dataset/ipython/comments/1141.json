Imagine you have a kernel that crashes at some point in a run so it gets restarted.

The other thing that can be done is sort the cells by prompt number after reopening it.  I actually have a method on notebook that does that, but currently there is no API for that.  At most, we should have a button for removing them at the user's request.  But let's wait until we move to a Menu driven UI before implementing that, otherwise the UI will become cluttered.\n"

In particular, I think keeping the numbers around by default is useful in that they are the only record of the original execution order of a document.  So if you reopen an old notebook whose code may not even run anymore (imagine it used a library you don't have access to anymore on your current computer), at least you can view it, print it to PDF, etc, and manually track what came after what.\n\nIn summary, I think the default should always be for the numbers to remain saved.  What we could offer is a way of for example printing without numbers, which could be nicer for handouts.  I hope our export capabilities will improve a lot and will become flexible very soon.\n"
