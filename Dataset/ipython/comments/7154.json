I think that was one of the reason for atomic writing in the first place, But we'll think about it.\n"

It would be okay if it's just one temp file per notebook (i.e. reuse the same name every time). But at present it's one file per save, which means that the number of temp files grows quickly because of the auto-save feature. My notebook folder has grown to a few hundred MiB before I noticed.\n"
