    "body": "The same is true if you want to save the webpage of the notebook, but when you press `Ctrl-S` - the notebook document ends up getting saved to the server, as opposed to the webpage dialog. `Ctrl-K` also blocks transitioning to Firefox's search bar. These are known 'issues' and unlikely to change. We override the behavior of `Esc` to suit our own needs, `Tab` and `Shift-Tab` don't do in CodeMirror what they do in a typical text area, etc.\n\nAs a workaround - you need to first focus the browser proper - in which case the usual shortcuts will behave in the standard way. Do this via `Ctrl-L` - so `Ctrl-L Ctrl-J` will do the thing that you want. And those few who need `Ctrl-J` to do the old thing can do so by disabling that keyboard shortcut altogether.\n"

We don't\noverride Alt-Tab, for example, because that's a shortcut to\nswitch between windows. OS X's Command-Up and Command-Down are at\nthat level.\n\nThe other workaround you have is to go into Edit mode. Ctrl-J and\nCtrl-K are not overridden there.\n"
