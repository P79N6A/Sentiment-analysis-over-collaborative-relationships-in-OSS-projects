    "body": "Hi Guilherme - thanks for looking into this, it's really interesting. I imagine @emilienschultz will also be interested in the results.\n\nI'm curious how exactly you calculated the TF - from the percentages you give, it looks like we have a TF of 2: Min and any one other of those people add up to >50% of the files.\n\na) We're certainly some of the main developers. The project is expanding rapidly at the moment, so there's a different (larger) pool of people who are major contributors today than the statistics you've gathered, which show more of a historical picture.\n\nb) I don't think winning the lottery would stop us doing what we do ;-). Losing those four people would certainly have an impact on the project, but I don't think it would be fatal - again, this is due to the growing set of major contributors. Some parts of the project would suffer more than others - for instance, IPython.parallel is something Min knows much better than any of the rest of us.\n\nc) Compared to other open source projects, we have funding - from academic grants and gifts from companies. All four of the people you listed are paid to work on the project, along with a number of others. So if the four of us took off, the project would hire some more people. Of course, that doesn't make it a non-issue: it would take some time to find the right people, hire them and get them up to speed with the project, especially with a big chunk of the core team gone. But I think it would happen.\n\nI guess we should make sure the four of us never cross the road together!\n"

(@ellisonbg author here), though I doubt this particular example would change Brian position in the project. Yes you speak about removing vendorized libs, I'm just curious in feb 2015, what language would have IPython be detected as. \n\nAlso I for example had some PR that would change 1 line across all files (update copyright). But does should not make me part of the contributor to a file. (I guess taken into account in the DOA calculation). \n\nIt feel strange to see @fperez with lower that 16% of authorship on files. \n\nIs the script that determine authorship availlable somewhere ? I would like to run-it on subpart of the tree. \n\nOtherwise seem relatively coherent. \n"

    "body": "There's one major shortcoming that comes to mind for git-based metrics for something like Truck-Factor, and it's that the developers who implement refactors are over-credited with authorship. I think this is a particular challenge in IPython, which has undergone an awful lot of refactoring, the majority of which has been by the four individuals you list above. That said, the developers who do the refactors tend to be those most familiar with the given piece of code. If not in the beginning, they can be by the end. Some of these refactors are just moving files around (e.g. the recent Big Split), which doesn't require looking at the files, but can inappropriately reassign credit to the renamer.\n\nHow are you accounting for 'authorship of files'? There are relatively few files that are actually 'written' by a single developer, and most would probably claim at least two 'main authors'.\n\nYou might also consider weighting files differently, based on some metric of importance. I have no idea how to do that in practice, but I probably get undue credit 'for IPython' from my work on IPython.parallel, which is a lot of lines and files, but is really not core functionality for many users of IPython (and part of why it is in its own repo now), whereas contributions to IPython/core/interactiveshell.py are super important to every IPython user.\n\nOther metrics could include non-code participation, such as mailing-list and GitHub comments.\n\nOn to your actual questions:\n\n> (a) Do you agree that the listed developers are the main developers of IPython?\n\nOn the ipython/ipython repo, yes, though I would add Matthias Bussonier who is the expert on many pieces of the code. There are several other developers working on IPython- or Jupyter-related projects, such as nbgrader, nbviewer, etc. who are critical to those pieces, so it depends a bit on what you mean by 'IPython'.\n\n> (b) Do you agree that IPython will be in trouble if the listed developers leave the project (e.g., if they win in the lottery, to be less morbid)?\n\nIf _any_ leave or _all_? I think it would definitely be in trouble for a while if we all left at once. However, there are a lot of enthusiastic and capable developers coming into the project right now, who I think would be able to fill voids left by any, if not all of us. I think this goes to the fact that many of us work on different pieces of the project, and none of us work on everything. For instance, of the four listed, Jon definitely has the most expertise on the interactive widgets. That said, Jason Grout and Sylvain Corlay and others have been doing a lot of work with Jon on widgets, and I would trust them to fill that void in time. I think most aspects of IPython are well enough understood by at least a couple of developers, including those outside the listed group, that it would survive. Some more obscure aspects would likely stagnate, such as IPython.parallel.\n\n> (c) Does IPython have some characteristics that would attenuate the loss of the listed developers (e.g., detailed documentation)?\n\nThe funding is definitely key. If we left while there is still funding, people can be hired to learn the code, rather than in their free time. I would say that our documentation is nowhere near where it needs to be to enable someone to become a new core developer upon the sudden departure of existing core devs. However, it is our hope to be able to get closer to that with the funding we currently have.\n\nI would also say that the popularity of the project, and the fact that it is a tool for developers, attenuates the Truck Factor a bit. Many of the users of IPython have the necessary skills to pick up development of IPython, and could step in if the need arose. This has happened once before, when Fernando was the only core developer and stopped being able to work on it, Ville Vainio stepped in as maintainer for quite some time. There are also quite a few core and non-core developers who have contributed to, if not been 'primary authors' on, IPython, who can be called upon.\n"
