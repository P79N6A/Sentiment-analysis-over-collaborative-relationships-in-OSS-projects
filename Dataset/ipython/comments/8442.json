    "body": "I also at times get the opposite situation: the boundary of all cells is too tall, leaving space after the last line in each cell. In this case, wide cells have a scroll bar and look as expected:\n\n![screen shot 2015-05-18 at 1 45 18 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1086081/7674122/4f7d294e-fd64-11e4-9fc8-99be97aac7d0.png)\n\nNote that the first cell does not have an empty line at the end. If I press the down arrow I go to the first line of the next cell. Similarly the right arrow from the end of the line.\n\nThe page changed to this state apparently by itself. I had reloaded the page after the screen shot in the bug description (with an ssh tunnel to the server open), done some work, ran a cell that took a while and when I returned, I noticed it was like this. It's possible it happened soon after the reload and I didn't notice? \n"

Now that I think about it, I remember thinking it _might_ have had to do with me plugging in and out an external screen. Anyway, resizing the window would always fix the problem (until next occurence), no page reloading needed.\n"

    "body": "The truncated cells look pretty similar. A few differences to the other wierdnesses though:\n- the extra cell height is new\n- can confirm that resizing (small enough to launch horizontal scroll) fixes it\n- scroll bars seem to be appearing and disappearing when they're supposed to (except where cells were truncated, though maybe they were invisible outside the box?)\n\nDo we blame this on code mirror? \n"
