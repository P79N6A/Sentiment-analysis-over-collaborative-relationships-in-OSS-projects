I know we've had these 'internal inspect errors' occasionally, and I got excited that you might have found a reproducible case so we can finally track things down.  But again, it seems this type of error is very, very tricky to replicate.  I suspect the inspect module has hidden state that gets messed up, but I haven't done a full audit to see where that could be the case.\n\nBut that's what makes these so hard to debug: they only seem to occur during long work sessions, and we've _never_ found a way to replicate one in isolation.\n"
