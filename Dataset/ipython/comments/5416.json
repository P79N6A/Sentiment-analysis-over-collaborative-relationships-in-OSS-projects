    "body": "Hi @guraltsev ,\n\nYou may be interested in #4362 which partially implements this feature.  We talked about this in a [dev meeting](https://hackpad.com/2014-IPython-Weekly-Development-Meetings-v8bNV6EmqVd#:h=January-30,-2014).    Part of the reason it was delayed for 3.0 is because we need to decide how the information will persist to the notebook.\n\nCheers, \nJon\n"
