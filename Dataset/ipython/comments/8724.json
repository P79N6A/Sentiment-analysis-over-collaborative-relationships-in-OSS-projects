    "body": "The basic fix (counting all invisible characters, not just known color codes) is easy. \n\nThe more advanced fix (taking into consideration that a dynamic prompt might have a different number invisible characters each time it is displayed) is awkward with the existing API, which implicitly assumes that the number invisible characters is the same for any given template. PromptManager.invisible_characters is a dictionary mapping prompt type (`in`, `out`, etc.) to number of invisible characters. Really, it should be a function which is called on a prompt string. You can only count the number of invisible characters on a prompt string once it is rendered, and you should only render it once.\n\nMy personal use-cases don't have this situation, but it's not hard to imagine some (e.g., say you put a colored git branch in your prompt, but the branch is not there if your current directory is not in a git repository). The current code would do the wrong thing if you don't use the known IPython color codes, and even after the basic fix checking for `\\001`, and `\\002` it would do the wrong thing if you change directories inside the session, or some other change where the number of color codes changes. \n"

We want to be platform independent. But for now, you can of course just try to fix it.\n\nFurther, using `len` to calculate the width of a string on the terminal is most of the time wrong. Normally, we should use `wcwidth` instead, but in this particular case, I think it's still fine, because we are talking about a width difference.\n\nAbout replacing readline with prompt-toolkit, I hope to be able to resume work soon. I'm back from vacation, but in a week I'll leave again, and there are a few other priorities.\nJonathan\n"
