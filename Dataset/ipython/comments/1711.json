    "body": "@Carreau some feedback on the tooltip:\n\nFirst, some related to the visual consistency:\n- I think the tooltip needs to have a solid (non-gradient) background.  Reading text on a gradient bg is visually distracting.  We should find a neutral solid color that matches our theming.\n- The amount of corner rounding on the tooltip popup is too much given how other elements have their corners rounded.  We should use something closer to what the rest of our page has.\n- The shadow of the tooltip should more closely match that used by the menus in the menu bar.\n- The small icons in the upper right corner have a right padding of 15 px.  This should be reduced a small amount.\n\nSome related to the different modes:\n- I don't understand what the third mode is when the clock/watch appears.  It doesn't look any different from the 2nd mode.  Can you clarify.\n- You used to be able to open the help in the pager by pressing tab another time.  That seems to have gone away.\n- I think having a simpler model with only 3 modes might make sense:  1) default small mode 2) expanded mode 3) pager mode.\n"

    "body": "@Carreau, @minrk, @fperez: I am running into a nasty bug in this branch now.  It is difficult to reproduce, but when it does show up, it renders the notebook useless.  Here is a description of what I am seeing.  In the course of using the notebook for \"regular work\" I occasionally end up using the mouse to click on different cells.  One in a while, I will try to click on a cell and nothing will happen.  Usually a click should select the cell (outline appears) and focus should be given to the CodeMirror editor.  When this bug shows up _nothing_ happens - it is like I didn't click at all.  At this point, everything about that cell becomes wedged.  You often can't even navigate to the cell using the keyboard.\n\nI have a vague feeling that this shows up after you have used tab completion or the tooltip in a cell.  Almost like when those widgets are closing, they are not cleaning up their state and they are capturing/blocking events.\n\nPart of what is wierd about this is that if the wedged cell has an output area, if you click on that, you can select it.\n\nThe frequency with which this shows up is really low - I have only observed it maybe 3-4 times of working full time with this branch for the last week.  We will need lots of people using this branch to try and profile the bug.  @Carreau, can you look at the tooltip and completer to see if there is anything that would cause this.  \n"

I have seen the problem on ubuntu 11.10 with unity and firefox and perhaps ubuntu 12.04 as well. I have until now attributed the issue to a unity bug since unity has severe issues with focus in maximized windows, especially after using ctrl+alt arrow keys to navigate virtual screens which breaks context menus among other things (I stopped using unity for that and other reasons). Is it possible that the issue also exists on master but is just very difficult to trigger? I don't remember seeing the issue lately on master but if I can trigger it I will post it here. \n"

    "body": "@Carreau OK I have merged your branch and it does fix the previous problem of not being able to mouse click on the following cell.  But it creates a new problem.  To reproduce, do the same setup as before (two cells, type `range(` and 4 tabs in the first cell).  Then try to use the down arrow key to navigate to the second cell.  The second cell will temporarily be selected for a fraction of a second, but then the first cell will be auto-reselected.  I added some debugging code and you can see that Notebook.select is being called twice in series.\n\nI have also found that L353 of tooltip.py often gives the following error in the JS console:\n\n`353Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'focus' of undefined`.\n\nThis is the `Tooltip._cmfocus` method that focuses the code mirror editor of a given cell.  I think this method is being triggered at the wrong time when the tooltips active cell is _not_ the actual selected active cell on the notebook.  Calling code_mirror.focus on a cell is dangerous in general because of this risk.  Can you modify this code to make sure focus is only called on the selected cell?\n\nOverall though, I think the underlying issue is that there are problems with how the tooltip in managing focus.  It almost looks like the tooltip is capturing events, even when it is not open.  \n"
