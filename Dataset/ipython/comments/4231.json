I realized that all the children output elements were inheriting the `display: block;` attribute in javascript output.

The javascript output that you are trying to show is just appended to this object, making it a child of this element. The `prompt` div is also a child of this `container` object. All children inherit this `display: block;` attribute as a consequence. So the `prompt` div actually becomes a block element that runs across the page (notice the white-space gap above the checkbox in the bad example above). The width is the same as any other prompt... but this attribute forces other divs to start on a new line (not inline with the prompt). Does that make sense?\n"

    "body": "OK I understand the problem better now, that helped.  I think the fix is for us to give the `output_area` an `hbox` class if there is a prompt.  That element is created in the `create_output_area`.  The `hbox` class is defined in `static/base/less/flexbox` and sets the display attribute to `box`.  This is this so called \"flexible box model\" and is a more powerful way of laying out elements on the page.  An `hbox` class will make all of the sub-elements layout in a horizontal manner and hide/show should respect that.  We may need to set some other classes on the prompt/output_subarea divs as well (look more into the FBM stuff and how we set it in the input area.\n"
