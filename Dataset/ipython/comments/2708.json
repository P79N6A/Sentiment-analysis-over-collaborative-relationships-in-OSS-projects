    "body": "fantastic stuff. as a plugin writer, i would love to be able to use LESS when building new widgets.\n\nwhat relationship does this have to the larger JS/HTML refactor? In that vein, it seems like picking up an existing LESS-ful framework like bootstrap could be beneficial. I have found that my code has gotten much cleaner on the JS side after dropping bootstrap jquery-ui for page basics... and the theming is much, much cleaner. of course, the jqui stuff would all still work.\n"

It is a\nlong-term goal to split the notebook (and other frontends) from the IPython\ncore repo in the long run, but for now it makes no sense, since there is\nstill too much coupled development (we would have to make simultaneous\nreleases\nand require exact version matching, which makes the separation functionally\nmeaningless, and only a source of problems).\nOnce the boundaries between some of these parts of the code have\nsolidified, IPython will probably become a few repos (ipython, ipython-zmq,\nipython-parallel, ipython-notebook, ipython-qtconsole).\n"

That's it. So you need the bootstrap .less files to do so\nand compiles in **one** style.min.css you should avoid as much as possible to  have multiple class in dom.\n\nThat's how I understand less and bootstrap.\n\n> I don't think we want to do it in this PR, but I think we should create static/ipython and put all of our IPython specific assets there in subfolders (css, js, less, coffee).
