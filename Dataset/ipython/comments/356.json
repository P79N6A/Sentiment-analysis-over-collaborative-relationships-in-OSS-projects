    "body": "This looks awesome, thanks!\n\nWhen we get proper config support for the console it will be easy for users to set their preference, let's leave it as is for now.\n\nOnly one question: is it easy to somehow provide visual indication if the cell is 'locked'?  Something like changing the background color or adding a thin line above it to indicate  the cursor now has a 'wall'?\n\nIf something like that is easy to add, it would be a great addition.  If not, go ahead and merge and push.\n\nMany thanks  for this!  I'll make new issues for any other usability points I find.\n"
