We want to be able to tell users where their config files are, without having to ask which platform they're on. Also, we were never actually using the XDG directories properly - we mixed config with application data that should go in .local, and probably some runtime files that should be in $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR.\n\nBrief minutes are at https://hackpad.com/IPython-dev-meetings-6wTSjJt7TZK , and you can watch the video to see the full discussion.\n"

(approximately: while `XDG_CONFIG_HOME=~/.config/` by default, _the user_ can configure it to point elsewhere. but those users of course know what they’re doing)\n"
