A perfect example of where this would come\n  up is in allowing rest/latex style labeling of heading cells.  If we want\n  to allow for that, it probably won't be markdown.\n\nI would like to have a better sense of what our long term markup syntax\nplan is before committing to this change.

I'm not sure \"makes it harder to create a mutant love child\" is a particularly strong argument, though.\n\nHere's what the heading cell has always meant to me:\n- adding semantic / structural information to regular headings\n\nIt has always been a small, easily fixed, bug that we forgot to properly render the text in a heading cell.\n\nI cannot imagine that we would want to change that, and the lack of formatting means that users have to _choose_ between formatting and structure, which is a clear failure of design.\n"
