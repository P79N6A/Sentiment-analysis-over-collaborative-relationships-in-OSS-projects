I've been working with vim-ipython as a frontend, which makes it easy to group a bunch of code into a single cell. It might not be the same from the console front-ends. I'd be curious to know what others are thinking.\n\nDo the console front-ends display output from other clients at the end? It seems to make sense to keep the model the same between the existing front-ends.\n"

I think that would require a separate, dedicated mechanism.\n\n@nheijermans I'll close this PR, since it's on the wrong target. Feel free to open a new PR against master, and we can continue the discussion there.\n"
