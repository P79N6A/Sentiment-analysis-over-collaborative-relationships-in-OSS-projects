    "body": "I'm not sure about this. Creating a virtualenv affects the Python version and site-packages, but it doesn't typically affect things like configuration (e.g. ~/.matplotlib, ~/.pip, etc.). The `.ipython` directory is configuration, which is generally not overridden by virtualenv.\n\nPlus, just from my personal experience, I would never want this - I use virtualenv to switch packages around, but always want my IPython configuration, no matter what env I am using.\n\nRight now, you can opt-in to this behavior by setting the IPYTHONDIR environment variable in the `activate` script of any given env.\n"
