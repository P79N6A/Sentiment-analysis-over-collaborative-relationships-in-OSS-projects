It would only add complexity to a get around having to type `%debug` to get back into pdb if one accidentally `Ctrl-C` and pops out of there after this is merged. On the other hand, this solves a real problem that's much harder to get out of - a wedged kernel that must be restarted if the client which initiated the session loses the handle on it (by either re-executing the cell and losing the output block, or reloading the page). So let's merge this as is.\n"

    "body": "Did this issue come back to life in the Jupyter conversion? My IPython 4.0.0 notebook hangs and cannot be interrupted if I put the following in a notebook cell and then reexecute it before finishing the `ipdb` session.\n\n``` python\ndef test():\n    pass\n\n%debug test()\n```\n\nI'm new to `ipdb` so maybe I am misreading this. It's also not clear to me where I should be reporting/asking this, so thanks in advance for your patience.\n"
