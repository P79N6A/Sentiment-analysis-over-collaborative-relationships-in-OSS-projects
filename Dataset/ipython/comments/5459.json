I pushed the changes in a new commit instead of amending so we can fall back to ff8e16c if we need to.\n\nI think I actually may see why the flicker is happening...  I'll ping again if I find an easy fix (to add into this PR).\n\nAlso I'll update the description in a bit, summarizing all of the things wrong in master.\n"
