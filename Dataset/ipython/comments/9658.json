Note that it touches only the `from somthing i<tab>` as IPython completer return `import[space]` which has the 2 following specificities: \n 1) is the only completions\n 2) has a trailing space.\n\nEvery case that do not match the 2 above conditions behave correctly and do not re-query the completer. \n"
