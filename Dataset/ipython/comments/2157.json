Wrong error, that was from me trying to fix it! ;) This was the error:\n\n```\n$ python ipython.py\nWARNING: Couldn't start log: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/groups/chklovskii/home/nuneziglesiasj/ipython-logs/automatic-log--2012.7.16--12.5.py'\nIn [1]: \n```\n\n... However, it looks like that was _also_ my fault â€” `~/ipython-logs` was only created at 12:09pm. ;)\n\nSorry!\n"
