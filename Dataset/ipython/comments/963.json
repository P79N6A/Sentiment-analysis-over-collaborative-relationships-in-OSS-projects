    "body": "An argument against this one is that it disables calltips perhaps too conservatively.  It appears to only be macs affected (not the PySide bug itself, but the code path to the call seems executed only on mac), and it is a very specific call that throws the error, so we could circumvent the call much more narrowly.\n\nI'm fine leaving it like this, though, as PySide is in relatively rapid release cycle right now, as it irons out various bugs, and we should probably bump minimum supported version to at least 1.0.7 before too long.\n"

But I agree that we should not let this sort of thing proliferate.  At the first sign of a more serious bug, or other similar bug, we should bump it, and depending on timing wrt EPD, etc., it may make sense to push the base when we do actually release 0.12.\n"

We will happily bump the version to 1.0.8 (or whatever it is at the time), when the next EPD ships, but preventing the qtconsole from running in environments where it is known to work quite well doesn't make a lot of sense.\n"
