    "body": "There isn't a v2.0.10-1 tag... Some things got a little confused when we briefly had 2.0.10-1, but changed it to 2.0.10.1.  There was still a dangling (not tagged, no 'v') 2.0.10-1 branch, so I just removed that, and replaced it with a proper 2.0.10.1 branch pointing to the v2.0.10.1 tagged commit.\n\nCan you checkout [v]2.0.10.1?  ack reveals no instances of '2.0dev' in that revision that I can find.\n\n'2.0dev' is the version string we are using for bugfixes in 2.0.x (aka maint in zeromq).  `'2.0dev' > '2.0.10'`, so assuming 2.0.x is up-to-date, then the check still evaluates correctly, because 2.0.x is indeed newer than 2.0.10.\n"
