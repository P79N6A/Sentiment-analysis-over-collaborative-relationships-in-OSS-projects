    "body": "Ah, this is somewhat insidious. So, you're not actually setting it to a new `dict`... if it was going to work at all, it would work as soon as you added the pears, not when you re-assigned it.\n\nIf you set `w.options` to something else altogether before setting it to your fruit options again, it will update. Or, tricks like `w.options = tuple(options.items())` would get around this.\n\nUnfortunately, the traitlets are just [not quite ready](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/api/generated/IPython.utils.traitlets.html)  for the kind of behaviour you expect:\n\n> We don’t support:\n> - A full set of trait types. Most importantly, we don’t provide container traits (list, dict, tuple) that can trigger notifications if their contents change.\n\nWhile this is no longer strictly true, as there are the [EventfulDict](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/api/generated/IPython.utils.traitlets.html#IPython.utils.traitlets.EventfulDict) and list types, they are not presently available in conjunction with Any (to my knowledge).\n"

The trick mentioned is good work around.\n\nOne other tip: to display options in a particular order in the updated view (in my case alphanumerically) set `w.options = []` and then set `w.options` as desired. Otherwise the new options are just appended to the current ones in the view.\n"
