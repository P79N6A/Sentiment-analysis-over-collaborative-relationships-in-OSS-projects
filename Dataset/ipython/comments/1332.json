We have so much development happening quickly right now that occasionally this happens, though the conflict should be trivial to resolve.   Can you rebase it on master and push again?  Let me know if you need a hand with that and I'll be happy to help.\n\nI went over the code and it looks good to me, thanks!  It will be great to have your name on our logs :)  BTW, I saw you updated the docs, do you think it's worth explicitly mentioning how this can help anyone who's behind a proxy?  I just think that might not be so obvious to a newbie/confused user, and having a sentence that says it explicitly may help them understand better, and will also make it more googlable.\n\n@ellisonbg, do you see any other points that need addressing before merge?\n"

There's an unrelated doc touchup (commit 1eb8d1b471b76b41b1e89ae96d3626be33949ebe ) in there now, too. (I deleted and pushed up a new set of commits to the branch with name that were' discussing here. Hopefully the IPython team doesn't consider that bad style.)\n\n@fperez I don't have this working behind a proxy (yet!) but think that now I have an issue between my proxy webserver, Tornado, and websockets. I'll definitely do some more work in the docs when/if I get this working.\n\nWhile discussing working behind a proxy: this latest iteration also includes a commit 6569d28a50b to allow setting the websocket hostname. This is usually inferred from the \"host\" variable in the request, but when behind a proxy, this can be unreliable, so it's potentially useful to be able to pin it at config time.\n"

In that case, perhaps we should cherry-pick 382069c as suggested by Andrew to avoid any more merge conflicts, while that is discussed.\n\nSince Andrew isn't familiar with all the intricacies of our config/traitlets machinery (which is a bit complex, I still get lost sometimes), my suggestion is that we don't hold this one up over that point, given the potential for merge conflicts it has (two rebases already).  One of us can fine-tune that in a separate PR; how does that sound?\n"
