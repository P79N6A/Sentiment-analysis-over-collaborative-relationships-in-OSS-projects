    "body": "I think it will be great to make it more general to be used other than d3, but it might be a good idea to start with one framework before it gets to complicated.  It will be nice that a codecell can run javascript, but there is a good chance that arbitrary can totally mess up the whole notebook DOM.  My earlier hacking uses IFRAME or open a new window to avoid that (e.g. https://github.com/cschin/IPython-Notebook---d3.js-mashup).  It seems to me we need some \"namespace\" to constrain about what and where the javascript can manipulate. I don't have a good solution except the IFRAME thing now.\n"

If malicious code ended up at the other end of any external link (or was injected along the way) that would be a **very** bad thing.\n\nWe are only executing JS code that come from the user's python code.\nThey have to trust that Python code to not do bad things.  We\ndefinitely would not execute externally-linked JS code.  Although if a\nuser wants, they can write python code, that write JS code that does\nthat.\n\nBut keep in mind: IPython is already like a big gun.  With regular\nIPython - not even the notebook - you can completely destroy your user\nfiles and DOS your system.  I could send you a simple Python script\nright now and tell you to do:\n\nIn [1]: %run danger.py\n\nand create this type of destruction.  Bottom line: you have to trust\nthe Python code you run in IPython.  This new feature in the IPython\nnotebook doesn't change that one bit.  The only additional risk the\nnotebook has is that someone could use it to get remote access to your\nsystem.  But if they do that, they surely don't need to execute JS\ncode to create trouble.\n\nCheers,\n\nBrian\n\n> Also external links require internet connectivity, which can sometimes be a frustrating dependency.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1386#issuecomment-3859451\n\n## \n\nBrian E.
