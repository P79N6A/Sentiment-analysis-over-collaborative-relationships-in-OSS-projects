    "body": "Hi @dsblank ,\n\nThere already is a PopupWidget.  Adding a password character property for the textbox widgets is an easy addition, but you'll probably want to hash the password client-side so it isn't visible in the plain JSON sent to the back-end.  This also wouldn't be too hard, but it would make sense to write a new widget  -- PasswordWidget or something, which only allows hashed data from the front-end to be sent to the back-end (here back-end to front-end doesn't make sense).  I'll bring it up in todays meeting.\n"

    "body": "The following code will work once #5014 or similar gets merged (fixing command mode + popup widget bug).  **Until the bug fix is merged, you probably shouldn't use this since the notebook will be in command mode as you type in the popup.  Also, this example does not hash the password before sending it to the back-end, this is only useful to hide characters in the front-end and receiving plain text in the back-end- In other words shouldn't be used in production.**\n\nPassword widget implementation:\nPython\n\n``` python\nfrom IPython.html import widgets\nfrom IPython.display import display\nfrom IPython.utils.traitlets import Unicode\n\nclass PasswordWidget(widgets.TextWidget):\n    _view_name = Unicode('PasswordView', sync=True)\n```\n\nJavascript\n\n``` javascript\nrequire([\"notebook/js/widgets/widget\"], function(WidgetManager){\n    var PasswordView = WidgetManager._view_types['TextView'].extend({  \n        update: function(options){\n            this.$textbox.attr('type', 'password');\n            return PasswordView.__super__.update.apply(this);\n        },\n    });\n    WidgetManager.register_widget_view('PasswordView', PasswordView);\n});\n```\n\nUsage example:\n\n``` python\ncontainer = widgets.PopupWidget()\nusername = widgets.TextWidget(description=\"Username:\")\npassword = PasswordWidget(description=\"Password:\")\nlogin_btn = widgets.ButtonWidget(description=\"Login\")\ncontainer.children = [username, password, login_btn]\n\ndef login(sender):\n    print('Username: %s, Password: %s' % (username.value, password.value))\n    container.close()\nlogin_btn.on_click(login)\npassword.on_submit(login)\n\ndisplay(container)\n```\n\nView/download the original notebook here: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/jdfreder/8795537\n"
