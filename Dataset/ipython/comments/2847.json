Anyway, I've read through the Qt documentation for [QToolTip](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qtooltip.html#showText) and it doesn't appear that there is any mechanism for having the tooltip stay within one monitor.\n\nThe only alternative would be to use a different mechanism to display the help text --- perhaps in a frame within the window?\n"

    "body": "Hi, \n\nThe qtconsole has been moved to https://github.com/jupyter/qtconsole, and this issue had no activity for quite some time. If this is still relevant I would suggest this issue to be reopen on the above cited repository. \n\nThis will allow us to keep the number of IPython issues smaller and focussed on IPython. As currently there is an extremely high number of opened issues , it make it really hard to find if a problem is actually known, or going to be worked one. \n\nFeel free to reopen if need, for the time being I'm going to close this. \n\nThanks.\n"
