    "body": "@Carreau I am really stumped on this one. The issue is that when the completer opens, we focus the selection area of the completer and handle keyboard events with `Completer.keydown`. Because the completer is attached to the body, the keyboard events never reach that CodeMirror instance to allow the user to keep typing. I don't see how it is possible to 1) keep the CM editor focused so the user can type and 2) keep the completer Ui focused so its own keyboard shortcuts work. How did this ever work in the first place?\n"
