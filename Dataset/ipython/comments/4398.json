    "body": "> I missed where this came from, but it makes me :-(  to not be able to just tab to get the tool tip.\n\nThe rationale (on a muti language env) is that to be able to decide whether to use `oinfo` or `complete` there have to be some lexing in the frontend if both are bound to tab. So either we extend the message spec (to decide in kernel), or we split help/complete action on 2 keys.\nShift tab exist for quite some time now and was already configurable, shift tab have also the advantage of working on selection in the middle of code.\n\nI personally was for the first solution of asking the kernel, but in some case there is no way to decide what the user wish.\n\n> I am still able to sometimes trigger the tooltip by pressing tab a bunch of times.\n\nWill try but I don't understand why...\n\n> The completions I get with this branch don't make sense, either (why should cell magics pop-up first as arguments to a function call?)\n\nThis is how completion behave in all frontend, not notebook specific : \n\n```\nIn [3]: histogram(\nDisplay all 343 possibilities?
