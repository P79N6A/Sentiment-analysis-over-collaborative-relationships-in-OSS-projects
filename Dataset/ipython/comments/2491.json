    "body": "I have no mono experience, but very likely no. Hooks in IronPython are very pyreadline specific. I can imaging under mono native readline can be accessed almost directly.\n\nAnyway, I don't think there is any user of ipython in mono, so I am not breaking anything. Changes in IronPython required to make ipython start REPL are quite substantial and they did not make to the latest 2.7.3 release. \n\nIf you know anybody interested in booting ipython under mono, let me know. I will be happy to assist.\nI also think that it would make sense to update your wiki about ironpython support. \nAny suggestion how should I go about it?\n"
