On the one hand this seems like an odd bit of code to add to IPython, but on the other hand it seems necessary for some work with strings.  I'm also concerned that non-string objects might also be in the pandas DataFrame, causing the NumPy cast to go awry.\n\nThe good news is that it's also relatively simple to replace the pyconverter in the RMagics class at runtime.  A simple custom extension could, for example, also provide this functionality:\n\n``` py\ndef converter(x):\n    ...\n    # as before\n    ...\n\ndef load_extension(ip):\n    \"\"\"Load rmagic extension and inject a custom Python -> R converter.\"\"\"\n    ip.extension_manager.load_extension('rmagic')\n    ip.magics_manager.registry['RMagics'].pyconverter = converter\n```\n"
