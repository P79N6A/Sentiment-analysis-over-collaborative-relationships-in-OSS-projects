    "body": "If your browser language is set to Arabic or Hebrew, we currently trigger right-to-left layout automatically. You can toggle it in the command palette (Ctrl-Shift-F, then search for rtl), but you'll have to do it each time.\r\n\r\n@samarsultan we've had a number of issues opened about this. I guess a lot of people who speak Arabic/Hebrew are used to interfaces written in English being displayed left-to-right? Is it worth disabling RTL by default, at least until there are translations for these languages?"
