    "body": "We should just write our own code for this - it is pretty simple stuff\nand we will need to generate a UI that matches our UI theming.\nJqueryUI has a set of builtin icons that will match our theme and I\nknow they have a couple +/- options as well as other collapse/expand\nones.  But from the UI design perspective, I am not convinced we want\nto go with an icon/button for collapsing/expanding.  I am loath to\nstart putting buttons on the main notebook area.  We will just need to\nplay around with different options.  One such option would be to only\nshow the +/- when you hover over a the output area.  But the code\nitself is not difficult to write.\n\nOn Thu, Mar 22, 2012 at 4:34 PM, Fernando Perez\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\n> What do you think of using this snippet: http://jsfiddle.net/RKsEm/ ?
