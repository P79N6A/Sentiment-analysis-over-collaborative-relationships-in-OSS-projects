    "body": "This fixes the problem, thanks!\n\nBut I'm a little worried about the amount of copy/pasted code between `interactiveshell.py` and `ptshell.py`... Shouldn't these two share more code, so we don't have to fix the same issues in two places? I missed the details of the refactoring, so I may be off-base, but it looks to me like a common base class with everything that's common should make more sense than having a `class TerminalInteractiveShell(InteractiveShell)` subclassing in both files...\n"

    "body": "Got it. But what I am worried about is the breakage for users. It is a\nweakness of our config system, but the reality is that we expose to the\npublic our actual class names. So if the class goes away, every user who\nhas configured things to, e.g. suppress the exit confirmation, will now get\nan error message, and things won't work as expected.\n\nI don't see an easy, clean solution, but I really don't want to keep\nbreaking the user experience like this...
