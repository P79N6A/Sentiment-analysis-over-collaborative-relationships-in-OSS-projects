    "body": "Thanks for working on this. A few comments:\n- In this branch, the padding of the raw cell is not set properly when in rendered mode:\n\n![screen shot 2014-03-10 at 2 26 52 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/27600/2379409/e9de5abe-a89a-11e3-92bf-6631fb6d2ba5.png)\n\nThere is some subtle padding logic that we do for text cells that may make it a bit difficult to do this right. Basically, we change the padding based on if the cell is rendered. This is needed because the padding needed around the CodeMirror editor is different from what is needed for rendered text.\n\nBut the unrendered `RawCell` should get `padding: 5px 5px 5px 0px;` I think.\n- A separate issue is that the `RawCell` placeholder should be written as one paragraph, rather than 3 sentences that look like a poorly justified paragraph. Might as well fix that here.\n- Another separate issue is that for `RawCells` the only time you see the placeholder is when you actually trigger the `rendered` state by pressing `Shift+Enter` and friends. Because most people won't ever do this for `RawCell`, the placeholder is not too useful.\n"
