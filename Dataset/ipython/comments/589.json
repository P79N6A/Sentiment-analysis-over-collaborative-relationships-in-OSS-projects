    "body": "That makes sense, but I'm a bit concerned by the fact that an error in that thread means crashing IPython, and I'm not 100% confident that every combination of Python and Windows will get the right answer.  Since we are trying to cut 0.11 final this week, does a loud warning&return (stop trying to poll) sound okay?  I don't want to _introduce_ a new way to crash IPython immediately before release.\n\nIf the poller doesn't work, that means the Kernel will keep running if the parent dies, but clean shutdown will still behave perfectly.  I think a loud warning to this effect should cover us for 0.11, and then we can upgrade to raising once we are confident that we catch every case.\n"
