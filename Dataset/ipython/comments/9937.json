    "body": "I think the issue is because the error is raised in a background qt thread, rather than during your plot call. The repeated error is probably because the plot is still 'open' so any time the matplotlib eventloop fires, it tries to draw again until the figure is closed. I'm surprised this gets us in a hung state, though. Maybe related to the way we talk to prompt-toolkit?\n"
