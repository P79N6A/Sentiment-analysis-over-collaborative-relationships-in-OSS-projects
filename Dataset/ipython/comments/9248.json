    "body": "Adding a bit more description to this issue to be clearer. \n\nThe code which is present in the file `IPython/utils/warn.py` was used for a long time by IPython to emit warnings; during the last few years and month, we replaced the usage of `/IPython/utils/warn.py` with the builtin Python warn module.\n\nIt seem like the `IPython/utils/warn.py` module is not use anymore, though we left it here for 1 release in order to give our users one last chance to update to the new API if needed without raising an `ImportError` exception\n\nNow that we are starting to work on IPython 6.0 and since this module is not used, it can likely just be removed. \n\nThis mean that the file `IPython/utils/warn.py` can be deleted, and likely we can add a file in `docs/source/whatsnew/` that says something along the line of  `IPython.utils.warn was deprecated in IPtyhon 4.0, and has now been removed`. \n\nThis should be a relatively straightforward issue for a new contributor that look to contribute to open source and looks to start helping. \n\nIf you are a user who is looking to take care of this issue and have any questions, feel free to ask; and or indicate you interest in working on this. \n"
