I could be wrong but I don't think `_repr_html` will work in tracebacks.\n\nHere's the (somewhat lengthy) discussion in question:  https://groups.google.com/d/topic/astropy-dev/mS2dF0D-zkM/discussion\n\nTo summarize, the use case is that we want except messages to, in some cases, include URLs to more detailed help text in the online documentation.  Many modern terminal emulators commonly in use today do display URLs as clickable hyperlinks. So we figured IPython Notebook ought to do the same.\n"

It could be added too I think. \nAs for the link, it was just for references.\n\nTraceback can surely be enhanced, but you should look at `IPython/core/ultratb.py` then. \nBut I'm not quite familiar with this part of the code. \n\nIt would be great to be able to get a Debugger like werkzeug one in the notebook. \n"
