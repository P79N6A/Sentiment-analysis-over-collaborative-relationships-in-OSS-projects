    "body": "Actually, in master the toggle output key is actually 'o', because 't' is now used for plaintext cells.  Sorry for these changes, but as we settle on the full feature set of the notebook, this churn with keybindings will subside.  But it's an inevitable effect of building things incrementally.\n\nBut that aside, `C-m-t` does work as advertised.  What opens a new tab is `C-m-C-t`: you are _holding_ Control throughout the keybinding, which effectively means you are doing control _twice_.  There is a difference between those two things: the first mode, which we support,  uses a _single_ modifier only for the 'm' character, and then the bare 't' key.  What you are doing actually sends `C-t` to the browser, and I actually don't think Chrome even allows us to intercept `C-t` (Chrome is very aggressive in not allowing certain kebindings to be intercepted).\n\nSo I'm closing this as things are working as advertised and in the only way we _can_ make them work reliably given how browsers operate.  Sorry if your muscle memory wants you to keep the Control key held down, but that's just the way things are.  As you can see in Emacs, for example, many actions are drastically different if you hold Control through both keystrokes than if you only use it for the first.  We have the exact same pattern here.\n"
