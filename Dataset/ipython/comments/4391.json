    "body": "I'm -0 on this change. Not sure why we'd want to have `brief_sys_info` that's used in exactly one place. `sys_info` is exposed at the top-level, i.e.\n\n``` python\nimport IPython\nprint IPython.sys_info()\n```\n\n and I presume that part of the reason it's a dictionary is to make it JSON friendly for sending over the wire for notebook javascript consumption.\n\nI would just take out the `brief_sys_info` function, and have the `report` function in `iptestcontroller.py` do the equivalent to the output of `sys_info`. If, however, you want to keep the extra function, I'd call it `sys_info_brief`, for tab-completion discover-ability.\n\nHaving two functions that do essentially the same thing, but in different ways, will mean having to always update two lines of code, should we decide to add something to `pkg_info`: the `pkg_info` code, and now the `brief_sys_info` code, which only grabs a portion of the pkg_info dictionary right now.\n\nI'm also suspicious of yet-more home directory collapsing logic sprinkled about our codebase: in utils/path.py we need to get the `os.path.realpath(homedir)` for things to work on FreeBSD, for example.\n"

    "body": "I'm :+1: to merge this, my only remaining :question: is whether or not it's a good idea to add another ipython entry point (`ipython sysinfo`). It seems to me like this might be more appropriate as a flag, since it's sort of like a glorified version of `ipython --version`, so perhaps just make what is in this PR the output of `ipython sysinfo` be the output of `ipython --version --debug` or something like that?\n\nThese aren't strong feelings, but I suspect @minrk and @fperez would be against adding another entry point, but exposing it as a flag (or a combination of flags we already have) would make sense. Especially since the full \n\n```\n{'codename': 'Work in Progress',\n 'commit_hash': 'ecbb01c',\n 'commit_source': 'repository',\n 'default_encoding': 'UTF-8',\n 'ipython_path': '/home/pi/code/ipython/IPython',\n 'ipython_version': '2.0.0-dev',\n 'os_name': 'posix',\n 'platform': 'Linux-3.11-1-amd64-x86_64-with-debian-jessie-sid',\n 'sys_executable': '/usr/bin/python',\n 'sys_platform': 'linux2',\n 'sys_version': '2.7.5+ (default, Sep 17 2013, 15:31:50) \\n[GCC 4.8.1]'}\n```\n\nwould make sense to have only in a setting where you're trying to debug something, no?\n"
