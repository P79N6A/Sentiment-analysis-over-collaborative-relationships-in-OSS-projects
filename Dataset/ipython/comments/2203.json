    "body": "Can you check to confirm that these keyboard shortcuts are not used on\nany platform/browser combination?\n\nOn Wed, Jul 25, 2012 at 11:16 AM, v923z\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Hi all,\n> \n> As discussed somewhere on the mailing list (I can dig out the reference, if necessary), I implemented basic history navigation in the notebook. Shift+UpArrow or Shift+DownArrow copies the content of the previous, previous-previous, previous-previous-previous (you get the idea) cells into the current cell.\n> \n> I would like to emphasize that this works on notebook cells, and not on the kernel history. My reason for this would be that first, this would work without the kernel, so one could use it when, e.g., updating documentation in the notebook, but not having access to the kernel, and second, it would be visually rather confusing, if the we were paging through the kernel history, for the kernel commands are not necessarily executed in the order given in the notebook.\n> \n> Let me know, if there is interest in this feature, and what should be improved upon.\n> Cheers,\n> ZoltÃ¡n\n> \n> You can merge this Pull Request by running:\n> \n>   git pull https://github.com/v923z/ipython master\n> \n> Or you can view, comment on it, or merge it online at:\n> \n>   https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/2203\n> \n> -- Commit Summary --\n> - Added history navigation\n> - Added history navigation\n> \n> -- File Changes --\n> \n> M IPython/frontend/html/notebook/static/js/notebook.js (30)\n> \n> -- Patch Links --\n> \n>   https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/2203.patch\n>   https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/2203.diff\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/2203\n\n## \n\nBrian E.

I think your point is valid. \n\n... You bring up a good point about multiple cell types - this shouldn't get cross-type content (no markdown in a code cell, etc.), so if we do it this way, it should skip over cells not of matching type.\n\nRight. That hasn't been implemented yet.\n\n... @takluyver brings up a good point - shift-arrow is used for selecting text, so it must not be used here.\nThen would you rather test against the edges of the text area, or use a different shortcut?\n\nI am not pressing for this particular shortcut. If we find another one, I am fine with it.\n"

    "body": "Hi Brian,\n\nI think I could implement it, but really the question is what we would \nuse for shortcut. I don't see any obvious choice for this at the moment. \nIf we can pin down the a keybinding for this, I can finish this off. So, \nI would say, we should keep this PR open.\nCheers,\nZoltÃ¡n\n\nOn 08/10/2012 04:05 AM, Brian E.

    "body": "I have found 4 keys (Cntr+m Left, Cntr+m Right, Cntr+m PageDown, Cntr+m PageUp) that work without problems, so both versions of the history navigation could be implemented. However, I don't seem to be able to invoke history_request from the notebook. Shouldn't this return something:\n\n```\nconsole.log(that.kernel.history_request(content = {'output': false, 'raw': true, 'history_acces_type': 'tail', 'n': 5}));\n```\n\nI couldn't find any pieces of code that actually calls history_request, thus I am not quite sure whether this is the proper way of using this method. If someone could give me a pointer, I could quickly wrap up this PR.\n"
