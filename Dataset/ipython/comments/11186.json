    "body": "Hi there, \r\n\r\nThanks for your question. This is usually a development issue tracker so issues there are more about IPython itself than other libraries. If you are learning Python, forums like https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/, or stackoverflow have better resources, and are more adequat.\r\n\r\nIn GitHub you can put code in between Triple Backtick fences ` ``` ` to render better (see how I edited your comment). \r\n\r\nIt is also good idea to give the snippet of code that fails instead of just the error, and usually give a self contain example that errors. In you case I can infer you did \r\n\r\n```\r\nData=pd.read_csv('docs.csv')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm going to assume you did `import pandas as pd` before.\r\n\r\nThe error looks (to me) like ``docs.csv`` is an invalid (utf-8?) CSV file. But I don't have access to the file, so cant' tell you. \r\n\r\nSide note, in `Data=pd.read_csv('docs.csv')` , `data` should be [by convention](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names) lowercase. Gettings good habits at the beginning will help you better read code.\r\n\r\nHope that helps !\r\n\r\n"
