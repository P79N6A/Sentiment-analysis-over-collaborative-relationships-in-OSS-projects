Your work got me thinking last night after\nI went to bed, and when Thomas was about to merge your pull request I\nstopped him, to try an alternative idea I had (revisiting an old\napproach with custom **repr** methods).\n\nThat didn't fly either, but in the discussion about your approach and\nmine, we managed to come up with a third solution that was\ncleaner/simpler than both.  No custom code in input handling, no wonky\nreprs, just part of the standard ipython autocall system.\n\nSo thanks for getting the ball rolling on this, David, even if the\nfinal implementation ended up being different!\n\nBest of luck with that exam, and I'm really happy to have you\ncontributing!  Things are in much better shape now for ipython, and\nit's great to see others joining us!\n"

I'm glad I could be of help, one way or another. The implementation was a horrible kludge but it seemed like the simplest possible thing that worked (although not the cleanest).
