    "body": "> And I proposed that the main.js have custom.js as a dependency. That solves the order of script loading problem, doesn't it? Your custom.js then does a require(['base/js/events'], function(events) {...}) and can then register event handlers for whatever it wants. I think this is a more natural solution and a more generic solution than magic init() functions or the like.\n\nThe problem is that you mix **reading** a script with actually executing code. What would you say is I tell you that : \n\n``` python\nwith open('myfile.py') as f: \n   f.read()\n```\n\nWas actually loading the `myfile` module and running it, (which by the way do stuff at import time, bad module) ? \nYou would not be happy. Same goes for js require. \nIf we change the behavior of `custom.js` then it should be design **not** execute things at require time.\n\nMoreover, using a define instead of an event allow more granularity, you can run stuff in custom js by being **sure** that some part of the app is not yet loaded (Hello custom patching of `IPython.Cell.cm_options` and default highlight mode). That does not mean that `events` should be discarded, they are usefull. \n"

Simply put something like `require(['notebook/js/cell'], function(Cell) {Cell.default_cm_options.whatever = 'my_value'})` in your custom.js.  If you want to change runtime instances, set up an event handler on Cell creation (and maybe change Cell to trigger such events).\n\nIf I understand your proposal correctly, you are basically defining a new event system (which the init handler will be run, etc.).\n"
