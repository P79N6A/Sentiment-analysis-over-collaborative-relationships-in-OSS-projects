    "body": "If we're planning to do 5.0 soonish, I think this probably makes sense. I was keen to make the prompt_toolkit changes before 5.0 because I didn't want to be stuck supporting readline installation with the LTS, but I'm not sure there are any equivalent issues with completion.\n\nIf 5.0 is still some way off, though, then I'd consider leaving the jedi stuff in and trying to iron out the bugs for a bit longer.\n"
