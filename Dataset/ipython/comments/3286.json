    "body": "Mostly history.  `ipapi` was originally the mutant nasty that almost killed IPython.  I spent most of a summer trying to exorcise it.  Originally, `ipapi` did much more that `get_ipython` does - that is what is being deprecated.  For me there are two reasons to change the name:\n- I don't think the name `ipapi` communicates what `get_ipython` actually does.\n- I want to completely close the book on the `ipapi` experience.\n- The official way of getting this should be at `IPython.get_ipython`. The function is simple enough that I am not sure it even warrants being anywhere other than `IPython.__init__.py`.\n"

I don't think this PR is the place for it: perhaps it's better to wrap up this cleanup and think about that separately, as that question has lots of little edge cases we should consider carefully.\n"
