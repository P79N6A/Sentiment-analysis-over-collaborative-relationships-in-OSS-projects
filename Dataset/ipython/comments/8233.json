I'm not sure there's a reasonable place to stop, which is why we moved lexing to the kernel. For that reason, I'm somewhat inclined to keep the 2.x behavior verbatim, since it's what v4 kernels have always received, and encourage kernel authors to support v5 if they want proper lexing for their language.\n"
