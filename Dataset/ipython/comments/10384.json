That make sense! However, that does not seem to be to existing behavior. `%gui qt` is *setting* QT API components to version 1, even when it shouldn't be (due to usage of the `QT_API` environment variable as specified in the docs).\r\n\r\nMy issue isn't about dealing with headaches from mixing applications that want different QT APIs; it's simply about not being able to use a single application (mayavi) that wants version 2."
