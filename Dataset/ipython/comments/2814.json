    "body": "It looks like the most recent failure occurred while pushing data to the engines prior to processing.  In this case, I had used the cluster previously to complete a job(successfully) and then started another job without restarting ipcluster3.\n\nThe code that led up to the failure is basically this.  A,B,C,D are numpy arrays and relatively small\n\n```\nrc = Client()\ndview = rc[:]\nlview = rc.load_balanced_view()\n\nlogging.info(\"Found {} engines\".format(len(rc)))  #Found 11\n\nstart = datetime.now()\nlogging.info(\"Pushing initial arrays to Engines\")\n\nar = dview.push(dict(A=A, B=B, C=C, D=D))  #Looks like failure happened here\nar.wait()\n```\n\nIn general, the work that we're doing involves pushing numpy arrays to engines, performing crunching, and then collecting processed data from the engines.  I can't include the code that runs on the engines, but the main controller code is essentially:\n\n```\n#Push additional arrays that are specific to the current phase of processing\nar = dview.push(dict(E=E, F=F, G=G))  #These arrays are large\nar.wait()\n\nresults = []\nfor chunk in chunks:\n    result = lview.apply_async(worker_method, (chunk,))\n    results.append(result)\n\ndview.wait(results)\nfor proc_result in results:\n    result_chunk = proc_result.get()\n    # do stuff with result_chunk            \n```\n\nSome of the arrays that we're pushing can be tens of thousands of rows by tens of columns, so maybe we're running into some sort of memory issues on our engines?  I've tried looking at the engine log files, but I haven't seen anything memory-related there.\n"
