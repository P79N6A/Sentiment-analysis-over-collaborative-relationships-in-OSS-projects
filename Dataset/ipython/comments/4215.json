Jython really should support explicit relative imports. If it doesn't, the only alternative would be to use absolute imports everywhere, but that would be rather annoying.\n\nAlso, we try to avoid merging master into feature branches - if there's a problem, we tend to rebase. I don't think it's a problem here, just a note for the future.\n"
