Closing here, since it's not IPython's responsibility to make dependencies of its dependencies available to other languages, but feel free to ask more questions.\n\nDid you compile the bridge with the libzmq in anaconda? If not, you may be loading a different library from the one code is compiled against, which can cause lots of confusion.\n"
