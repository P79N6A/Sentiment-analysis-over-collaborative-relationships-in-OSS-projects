    "body": "I don't think that's a bug in IPython. `sys.stdout` is expected to be a file-like object with a `.flush()` method, and plenty of code will expect that method to be there.\n\nIPython actually has a class that does what you're doing, with a flush method: [IPython.utils.io.Tee](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/api/generated/IPython.utils.io.html#IPython.utils.io.Tee).\n\nIt's not relevant to this, but you probably want to update to the latest stable IPython (3.2.1) by doing `conda update ipython`.\n"
