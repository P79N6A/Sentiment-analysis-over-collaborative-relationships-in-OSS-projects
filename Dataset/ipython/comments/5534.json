    "body": "Related question (especially for @ellisonbg): Do we ever want `pre` tags to have `line-height` other than `@code_line_height`? If not, we should probably move `@code_line_height` to the base variables.less, and define the default `line-height` for `pre` as `@code_line_height` instead of `inherit`.\n\nAs far as I can find, all `pre` tags expect this line height (input, output, prompt, pager - any others?), so it makes more sense for these to be the `pre` defaults rather than setting them repeatedly all over the place. The same might go for `@code_padding`, but we seem to apply the padding sometimes to containers instead of `pre`, so maybe not for that one.\n"
