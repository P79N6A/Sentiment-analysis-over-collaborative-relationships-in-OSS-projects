    "body": "> OK, I found that KeyboardInterrupt is treated in the master branch. But it does not treat shutdown by kill, right?\n\nYes, master does a much better job cleaning up after itself, but that does not include kill (that's kind of the point of Kill - you can't handle it).\n\n> is it safe to do rm `~/.config/ipython/profile_*/security/*` when there is no IPython instance running?\n\nYes, this is always safe.  In fact, I've been meaning to add a simple command `ipython profile clean`, which would remove everything in the log/security/pid directories, because they can grow.\n"
