    "body": "running startup scripts is part of Application, not the shell itself.  That is, the shell expects an initialized namespace, and the Application is what does this.  When you are embedding IPython, then you are initializing the namespace with the calling scope, rather than with exec_lines/files.  It doesn't make a great deal of sense to me to do both at the same time.\n\nI guess my question is, do you really want embedded IPython, or just a regular IPython session that you started yourself?\n"
