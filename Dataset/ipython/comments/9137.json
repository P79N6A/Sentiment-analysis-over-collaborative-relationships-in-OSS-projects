    "body": "That's because line magics, for better or for worse, all have `{}` style formatting of Python expressions into the command. So the inside of the set literal will be evaluated, and then repr-ed as a tuple, and %timeit will be trying to test a command like:\n\n``` python\nx in (inf, -inf)\n```\n\nYou can escape the braces by doubling them:\n\n```\n%timeit x in {{float(\"inf\"), float(\"-inf\")}}\n```\n"

This makes sense, but I must say that even after many years with IPython I did not know this side of the magic. :) In fact, even if I look for it in the documentation (both in Introducing IPython/Magic Functions and in the Built-in Magic Commands parts), I can't find this piece of information. It would be nice to put this simple fact in a prominent place in the documentation. :)\n"

It probably should be documented somewhere, but there aren't enough prominent places to describe every quirk in a prominent place. ;-)\n\nWe've talked before about backing off from this feature, and making it something only some magics do, but it's never been quite enough of an annoyance to get worked on.\n"
