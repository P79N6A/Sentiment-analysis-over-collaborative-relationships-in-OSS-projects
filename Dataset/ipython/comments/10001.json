I wouldn't put it past a configuration error, as I rebuilt everything (including Python 3.4 and Qt5) from source (the python35 binary pkg seems to be SIGBUSing too, so I did a source build to get debug info).\n\nThe ResourceWarnings occur at startup; I can't seem to silence them, and they're probably unrelated (newly introduced 3.5 sanity checks maybe?). Once IPython is running it seems ok (are there some exercises/thrash-tests I can run?). The SIGBUS happens upon shutdown.\n\nI was actually setting this up for a friend (I'll point him at this issue) - Python/Jupyter have been on my own \"that would be a really good idea to learn\" todo list for a while but I'm not there yet, so I have no idea what I'm doing. :P Neither of us are especially experienced at GDB but happy to try stuff.\n\n```\n$ gdb --args python3.5 `which jupyter-qtconsole`\nGNU gdb 6.1.1 [FreeBSD]\nCopyright 2004 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nGDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and you are\nwelcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain conditions.\nType \"show copying\" to see the conditions.\nThere is absolutely no warranty for GDB.
