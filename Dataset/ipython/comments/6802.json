    "body": "If all you want is to set the PBS queue name, you can do with with the `PBSLauncher.queue` configurable value, either in your profile config, or on the command-line. If you want a custom template, you can do that, too, in either place. What we don't yet have is the ability to add extra variables to the template formatting namespace, but this shouldn't be too complicated. It's already a Dict as `BatchSystemLauncher.context`, it's just not configurable. Adding a configurable `template_ns` Dict, and calling `self.context.update(self.template_ns)` should allow you to have a single custom template with as many fields as you like.\n"

    "body": "Thanks. After experimenting with this, I noticed that `PBSLauncher.queue` (or `LSFLauncher.queue`, since I'm working with LSF) does not work. However `LSFEngineSetLauncher.queue` and `LSFControllerLauncher` does. So I can do:\n\n```\nipcluster start --LSFEngineSetLauncher.queue=small --LSFControllerLauncher.queue=premium\n```\n\nAnd that fixes the queue part of the problem. However I need **way** more than just queue. At the very minimum I need also account number and wallclock limit.\n\nI'm looking into how to do that in a way that's compatible with the rest, but that is very unfamiliar to me, so it's taking much longer than I thought (e.g. why expose the internals of the API on the command line instead of passing a simple `--queue` argument, which would be automatically documented with argparse; why use `IPython.utils.traitlets.Instance` instead of directly creating a `IPython.utils.text.EvalFormatter`; how to best pass my wallclock limit parameter, since a simple `--LSFEngineSetLauncher.context[\"wallclock\"]=\"1:00\"` crashes the ipcluster startup; etc)\n"
