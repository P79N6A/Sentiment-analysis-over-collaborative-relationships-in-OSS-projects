    "body": "Thanks for your feedback.\n\nPerhaps I've misconfigured my version somehow. Before I made my changes, I inserted some debug statements to dump the whole of `self.settings` in the `ws_url()` method, to make sure I was looking for settings in the right place. What I got was a dictionary which had a `config` key whose value was a further dictionary with a `NotebookApp` key. I found all the `getConfig().NotebookApp` settings (e.g. `websocket_host`) under this dictionary. When I tried using the settings directly from `self.settings`, the settings from `ipython_notebook_config.py` weren't there.\n\nAlso, when I revert all my changes I find existing settings such as `websocket_host` are being ignored. Odd.\n\nI guess I'll have to hold off until I've got the spare time to comprehend the whole settings infrastructure more thoroughly - my production system is using a separate patch I created based on 0.13.2, so I don't need to get the latest version working urgently, it was just something I thought others might find useful.\n\n**EDIT**: Ahha, I think I see now. So the `settings` dict seems to be initialised near the end of the `NotebookWebApplication` class `__init__()`, and it happens to have the entire configuration as the `config` key, but I guess that's not the intended route for getting actual settings. In which case I wonder if `websocket_host` is missing from that? The only way of accessing it seems to be via the top-level configuration object, it seems.\n"
