The way to make this an extension is probably to create a standalone js file that is installed in `.ipython/profile_default/static/custom/custom.js` and try to implement it there. Our notion of an extension is not really formal that this point - basically just JS code that lives in custom.js or is loaded by it using `$.getScript` or `require.js`.\n"
