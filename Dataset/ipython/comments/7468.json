I propose that we make these two APIs completely parallel in structure and naming. Some options:\n1. Use only objects (no wrapper functions) named `Link`, `DirectionalLink`, `JSLink` and `JSDirectionalLink`.\n2. Use the same class names and also offer `link`, `dlink`, `jslink` and `jsdlink` function.\n\nIn either case, we need to add docstrings to the widget versions of whatever survives.\n\nPinging @jdfreder who will return tomorrow for input.\n"

    "body": "@ellisonbg an important change here - If you try to use widgets.link as if it's traitlets.link, there should be only two cases after this PR:\n1. it's one of the subset of cases where the two behave the same (Widget.sync_trait).\n2. it's in the traitlets.link superset, where HasTraits.trait works in traitlets.link, but not widgets.link.\n\nIn case 1, the link should work fine. In case 2, it will fail immediately with an informative TypeError that only Widget sync traits can be linked. I think this type checking is the important improvement in this PR. If you still think the names shouldn't match, I'm happy to add a `js_` prefix to both, or something similar.\n\nI would add a comment that due to exactly this hazard, if avoiding `import *` is not acceptable, it's typically a good idea to do your `import *` before doing any explicit imports, since it's a safe assumption that `import *` will clobber _something_.\n"
