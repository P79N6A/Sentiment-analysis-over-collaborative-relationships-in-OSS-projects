    "body": "This is deliberate, because the point of ctrl-Enter is a sort of 'terminal mode', where you just want to execute some code, but not actually preserve it in the notebook.  The reason the input is selected is so that you can just start typing and the previous input will be replaced.  For the same reason that ctrl-Enter makes it mildly inconvenient to _not_ replace text, failing to select it all makes it inconvenient to replace it, which is the expressed goal of ctrl-Enter.\n\nWhat are you using ctrl-Enter for if you want to preserve the contents of the cell but also not move on to the next cell?\n\nWe've guessed at common use cases, and the UI has been driven by the desires of the developers as they use it, but it's always helpful to hear how people are using it for whom our decisions are not ideal.\n"

    "body": "For my workflow: I tend to keep batches of code I'm working on together in lines, to avoid cluttering the UI with too many single-line cells.\n\nCurrently, I'm working on some code with one cell near the top containing parameters that later cells use. I've been fiddling with some test cases, and changing those parameters, and then jumping around to subsequent cells to test little chunks of code and how they end up behaving after the parameter changes.\n\nI was not aware that the express purpose of ctrl-enter is to delete or replace the code after running. Coming from Mathematica, running a cell in place does just that, and only that, if I remember correctly. Also, if ctrl-enter is designed to this behavior, I think it should be made a bit more explicit. The only difference when you hit \"ctrl-m h\" between shift- and ctrl-enter is \"in place\", so I got weirded out when the cells kept selecting. It feels like a macro I didn't write added on top of what I thought the basic functionality would be.\n"
