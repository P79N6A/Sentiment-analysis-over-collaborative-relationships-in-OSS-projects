    "body": "I don't know what @vascot had in mind, but I ended up here looking for the following:\n1. A table of contents based on the the either just the top level headers or one where the different header levels are indicated by different levels of indentation/numbering.\n2. It would contain the titles of the different sections with links to anchors at the beginning of that section.\n3. The placement would probably typically be after an opening markdown cell (i.e., one that includes a title an a brief introduction), but it could be left up to the user to place the table if/where they want it.\n\nIn other words, something almost identical to Wikipedia's tables of contents [see an example here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_roll).\n\nThe use case for this is that with long notebooks users may want to jump to a particular point in the notebook rather than having to scroll through looking for a specific section that is hidden in the middle somewhere. This is particularly valuable for learning purposes, where someone can't remember how to do a specific thing, but they know that there is an example in a notebook.\n"

In the end if you take the habit of making something a header with keyboard shortcut it is not much more difficult than using plain old markdown and it will greatly help you when you will use nbconvert. \n\nit is among the few things that I try to have people do, like not doing display_html() instead of defining `_repr_foo_` on their object, or write iPython instead of IPython.

Since it works with both HTML and header cells, hopefully it can help during the transition toward exclusively using header cells.\n\nIt also completely ignores markdown headers, because those are just awful.\n"

On my big desktop screen I see exactly enough place on the left for a nice hierarchical TOC that moves with me as I scroll, letting me quickly jump to other sections of big notebooks. :)\n\nI think the goal UX is something in line with the TOC offered in PDF readers (e.g. Evince in Linux, Preview in OS X). Being able to fold certain sections of cells would also be nice sometime in the future.\n\nRegarding heading cells, I personally don't use them, as it's easier for me to remember `#` and `##` in Markdown (don't know why heading cells were introduced as a separate entity instead of just a GUI way of generating the relevant Markdown), so it would be great if TOC could be made to use them as well.\n"
