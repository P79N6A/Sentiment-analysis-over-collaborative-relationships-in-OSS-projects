While the binary support itself is not language specific, I think it will tend to be used in language specific ways.\n\nI would still like to understand the usage cases where having binary comm messages is important. I suspect the idea is that it would be used for things like a spreadsheet widget where you want to send lots of data back and forth. Even in that context I want to push back a bit. To have such a widget work for all kernels, we have to make a decision about a a binary array format that all languages agree upon and that is also implemented in JavaScript. I am not at all convinced that is where we want to go if that is the main usage case.\n\nBut if the main usage case is sending binary - non base64 encoded images - through comms, I could imagine that might be useful in certain cases.\n"

While the binary support itself is not language specific, I think it will tend to be used in language specific ways.\n\nOnly data_pub and apply use binary data at the moment. The main use case I can think of is user-defined widgets with comm messages, sending data like images without having to b64-encode them. There are plenty of binary data formats that one could handle in javascript, images being the simplest and most useful (e.g. matplotlib nbagg). It's inherently not language-specific, because it must be understood at the very least in both javascript and the kernel.\n"

There is _no_ change needed if no messages are sent with binary buffers.  It's only when receiving messages with binary buffers that you need to implement the new wire format.\n"

    "body": "To add my +1 to this idea, the use case of sending array data to the clients without multiple encoding/decoding steps is a real one we're already encountering. [This thread on the list](http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/ipython-dev/2014-August/014798.html) (esp. subsequent messages) illustrate well cases where too many encode/decode steps will introduce significant latencies with very real impact on user experience, making certain kinds of analysis/visualization widgets  impossible to implement.  They would simply be too slow to be usable.\n\nRight now, projects that implement these kinds of widgets with high framerate image exploration tend to simply ship the entire dataset over to JS in one giant blob and hold it all in memory in JS. But that precludes the kind of kernel-side richer computation we can offer, since they are then forced to implement _any_ analytics entirely client-side in JS. Being able to efficiently send binary array data to the clients will open lots of possibilities here.\n"
