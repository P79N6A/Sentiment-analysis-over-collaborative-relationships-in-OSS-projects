    "body": "More generally, the qt console and notebook don't change their prompts at all, period.  To some extent this is by design, because the logic for prompt handling is so different in each environment that it's not fully clear that all clients can support dynamic prompts (the notebook, for one, likely won't at least for a long time).\n\nI'm marking this as an enhancement, but honestly it might be a pretty permanent limitation of the console.  The amount of frontend complexity needed to handle dynamic prompts is very high, so I'm not sure it's worth the cost trying to do that within the context of a GUI where text management and positioning is already a tricky issue.\n"

If this is still relevant I would suggest this issue to be reopen on the above cited repository. \n\nThis will allow us to keep the number of IPython issues smaller and focussed on IPython. As currently there is an extremely high number of opened issues , it make it really hard to find if a problem is actually known, or going to be worked one. \n\nIn this particular use case I guess we should have an option in each separate fontend. And as @takluyver pointed out, it's fixed on IPython itself. \n\nFeel free to reopen if need, for the time being I'm going to close this. \n\nThanks.\n"
