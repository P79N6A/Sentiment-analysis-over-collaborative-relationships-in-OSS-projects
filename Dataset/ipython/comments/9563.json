    "body": "The failure to update is likely due to a setuptools bug. What do you see for:\n\n```\npython -m site\n```\n\n? If you see '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages' higher than things in `/usr/local/lib`, then you have been bitten by a common setuptools bug. The fix is to make sure that no `easy-install.pth` file has a line containing `dist-packages` or `site-packages`. You can find these files with:\n\n```\nfind / -name '*.pth'\n```\n\nAnd edit them, to remove any lines with `dist-packages` or `site-packages`. Once you have done this, you can install upgraded setuptools/pip:\n\n```\npip install --upgrade setuptools pip\n```\n\nand then upgrade IPython:\n\n```\npip install --upgrade ipython\n```\n"
