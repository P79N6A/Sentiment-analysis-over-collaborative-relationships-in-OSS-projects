Any time I set up a new IPython install for myself or introduce someone else to the tool, I'm constantly having to make that adjustment to work around the flaw. Is there some way within the bootstrap framework to generate a percentage-based width rather than a fixed width?\n"

Also, we are deliberately keeping the width down for the following reasons:\n- At the 1170px width, you are looking at code cells that are over 130 chars wide. This is wider than almost everyone writes code.\n- At the 1170px width, you are looking at ~140 chars of Markdown text. This is _way_ over the recommended 45-90 chars/line considered good typography (http://practicaltypography.com/line-length.html).\n\nBut add the following to your `.ipython/profile_default/static/custom/custom.css`:\n\n``` css\ndiv#notebook > div.container {\n    width: 98%;\n}\n```\n\nTo get the effect you want.\n\nClosing.\n"

    "body": "Good suggestion for the override, thanks.\n\nAlso, just to give some context, this is not so much a problem for the input width as you pointed out, but it is for the output width. A large pandas DataFrame or a large plot is much more difficult to take in when the div width is significantly lower than the monitor's resolution width since you end up with a lot of wasted space on the left side of the centered div. Since most of my work in IPython Notebook tends to involve one or both of those in most cases, it's been a source of irritation.\n"
