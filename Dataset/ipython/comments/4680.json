    "body": "Actually, Pandoc availability should be tested and properly reported a lot earlier I guess. I would do it as soon as, from the command line args, we're sure that pandoc is needed which is nearly always I think. But from reading the code I see a lot of effort has been done to keep things separated, so importing nbconvert.utils.pandoc from nbconvert.nbonvertapp doesn't look extra-clean.\n\nAs of the latest commit, the module import will not fail but issue warnings: _\"Pandoc not found\"_ and _\"Bad Pandoc version\"_. Exception raising is left to the pandoc(...) function. This is to not tie nbconvert's life to Pandoc's availability but still give some feedback to the user.\n"

I moved the pandoc tests into a new `nbconvert/utils/test/` subdir.\n\nThanks for this feature, It's very useful- sorry it's taking so long to get it merged!  When you merge my PR against yours, or have any questions, feel free to ping me.\n\nEDIT: Removed a comment about the white space.\n"
