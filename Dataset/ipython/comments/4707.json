I don't know how to tell Linux to use big one with Qt, if you can find out that would be great, a pull request with the required change would be even better !\n"

What version of IPython do you have, and where did you install it from?\n\nIf you don't already have it installed, try installing the `ipython-qtconsole` package from the repos - even if you're using another copy, I think the system can still pick up the icons that installs.\n"
