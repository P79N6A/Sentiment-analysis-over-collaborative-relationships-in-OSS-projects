It also requires some architectural changes in how prompt-toolkit works internally. (The key bindings and the layout engine are too strongly decoupled right now, and this makes it very hard to create a key binding for which the behaviour depends on the amount of rows/colums that are used to render the completions.) Probably, this will be in one of the following releases of prompt-toolkit, but it's not the highest priority.\n"

Not totally a hands-on-keyboard solution, but better than having to hit down arrow a zillion times to page through a large set of possible completions.\n\nEven so, having some key combination to advance by columns would be nice, but scrollwheel support is a nice stopgap.\n\nEDIT: Nevermind -- the mouse support totally hijacks the mousewheel, even when the completion list is not present. So now it's impossible to scroll back the terminal. Not worth it to just solve the issue of skipping through the completion list. (Is that intended behavior for the mouse integration?)\n"
