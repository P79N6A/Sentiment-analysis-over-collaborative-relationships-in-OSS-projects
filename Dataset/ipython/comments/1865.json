Obviously we don't want to make tests open X11 windows, but anything that goes to a file would be OK.\n\nBut I don't know if all R installs have this feature or not...  If it can be done, great, but if it leads to brittleness or possible failures on different platforms/R configs, no worries.\n\nSo as far as I'm concerned this can go in, once these little questions are clarified...\n"
