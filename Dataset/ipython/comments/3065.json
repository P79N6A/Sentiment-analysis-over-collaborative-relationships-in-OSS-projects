    "body": "> running cells in a notebook creates a lot of \"diff noise\" due  to changes in the \"prompt_number\" fields. This necessitates individually filtering them out with \"git add -p\", which gets tedious quickly.\n\nInput prompts are output information, and they definitely belong in the cell data.  For those who want to strip these for git reasons, it should be easy to write a git pre-commit hook that either just strips the prompts, or does a full `reset && run all && save` on every changed notebook.  But if you re-ran your notebook in a different order from before, the changed prompts are not noise - they are real information.\n\n> Large blocks of text are serialized as a single row in the notebook. I realize this is a constraint imposed by JSON, but it means that deleting a spurious command results in a diff for what could be 50 lines of text, as diff is line-based.\n\nWhere are you seeing this? It isn't true of input or markdown.\n"

In that way, there is nothing special about the notebook - it lets you make whatever decisions you want regarding text wrapping, and it is reflected in the JSON.  If you want to write long lines, we will save long lines. If you break up your lines, they are broken in JSON.  It's all up to you.\n"
