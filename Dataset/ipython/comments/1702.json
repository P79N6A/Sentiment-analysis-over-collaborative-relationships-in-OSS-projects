    "body": "> So is it possible that the bug can be assigned to me?\n\n@priyanksh, you don't need to be assigned to work on it ( and actually we can only assign member of the core team).\n\nJust send us a PR that fixes the bug if you whish to.\n\nAs I see that you new to github, this means creating a banch that fixes the bug, pushing it to github and clicking the \"pull request\" button.\n\nBy saying \"fixes #1702\" into your commit message, it will automatically reference this issue when you open a PR.\n\n> I wish to work on this bug, I plan to do this by appending a time stamp to the older file\n> <.SavedAt>\n> It will give the user a choice to return to previous versions of the file also\n\nAs for the way of fixing it. I suggest you read the recent exchange on the ML, as some other users are interested in reworking the backend/frontend. (@benjiec if my memory is correct, sorry otherwise) \n\nIn short, we plan on adding git backend, and need also a UI for that. \n\nAdding timestamp is IMHO a workaround not a real fix. \ncorrect fix would be to warn the user and prompt them for a new file name or confirm the overwrite.\n\nDon't hesitate if you have questions.\n"

There is freedom in simplicity.\n> For overwriting and new name, existing save calls are being used, where as i have implemented handler for renaming the existing one and also the function for it\n> \n> There are two aspect of this issue that are being confused.  The first is how the server handles overwriting on saves or renames.  It simply should not ever allow that as the potential for data loss is too great.  So let's start there and make sure that overwrites are never possible on the server side of things.  When an overwrite is attempted the server should return a json strict with details about the error.  We need to design this json.  Remember there could be other clients that talk to the server and we have to make sure that those other clients can't overwrite.\n> For checking the overwrite on the client side i use a GET request to server to obtain the list of notebooks in the directory and then check for existence.\n> \n> It doesn't make sense to do a second GET on each save.  If we solve the problem in the server as I describe above it is not needed.\n> Is there anything else to be checked / implemented?\n> \n> 窶能n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n"
