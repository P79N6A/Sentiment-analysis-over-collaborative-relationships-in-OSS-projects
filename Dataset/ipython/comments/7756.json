There's no need for it to be consistent between pages.\n\nFor other stuff, it's just a collection of keyword arguments. If it makes sense to pass the same object to several things, as it might for common_config, it can go in.\n\nI'm now considering getting rid of common_options entirely, because it seems to be causing too much confusion, especially where we pass options to things that don't need or use them.
