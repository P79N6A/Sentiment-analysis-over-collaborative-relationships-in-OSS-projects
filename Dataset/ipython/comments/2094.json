    "body": "@takluyver, for future reference, I think we should refrain from answering questions on the tracker, and simply close them with the PS you gave.  I know it seems harsh, but the bugtracker forces only the core team to respond (we're the only ones who get auto-notified by default).  So if we start encouraging people to ask questions here (by actually answering their question, even if we redirect them afterwards), we'll get swamped here.\n\nSo I think we'll have to be a  little harsh with users and be more strict with that policy in the future, despite the fact it may make a few people grumpy.\n"
