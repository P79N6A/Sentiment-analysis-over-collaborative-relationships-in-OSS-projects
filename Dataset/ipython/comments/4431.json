This can be seen in activity monitor, a column displays whether an app is \"napping\" or not. If I run plain python, then it never naps, and the prompt stays responsive. If instead I run ipython, then the \"kernel\" process goes napping after a few seconds, and each time I stop typing for more than a few seconds it becomes unresponsive for a while.\nWe need to find a way to tell OSX not to do this.\n"

With Python running in the terminal, locate Python in the activity monitor (which should say Yes in the app nap column) and inspect the process (cmd+i). Go to the 'Open Files and Ports Tab', and one of the list should end in Python.app. Open that folder in terminal, which was in my case:\n\nopen /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Resources/\n\nIn that folder should be the Python app, right click it and Get info, and there should be a tick box for Prevent App Nap. Check that and it should solve the problem, it hasn't slowed down for me in the past ~2 hours (including a restart).\n\nTbh I'm very much a novice at this type of thing, so apologies if it doesn't work. For your info:\nipython 1.1.0\npython 2.7.5\nbackend: Qt4Agg\n(running ipython --pylab)\n\nHope this helps.\n"

The code spends basically all of its time in the likelihood function, which is numpy python.\n\nI manage my python install through macports, so i believe that python.org is the original source (but please correct me if that's not the case.)\n\n@wms2006 indeed the 'disable app nap' box was not checked, even after running the command i typed above.  I think that implies i got the wrong identifier.  I've checked it now, and will see how i go.
