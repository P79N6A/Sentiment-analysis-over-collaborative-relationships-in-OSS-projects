Do you have a preference to either way?  In other words, the only problem with this that I can see (which might not actually be a problem for you) is that it will only write the dependencies if being written to the local machine.  Maybe another opinion is needed, @Carreau ?\n"

(can I do it inside the dictionary?)\nAnd, last... I want the **option** to use the notes... I don't want the notes by default... it is a plus, and I think is has to be configurable, I mean electable... \n"
