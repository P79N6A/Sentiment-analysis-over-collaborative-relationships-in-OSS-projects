Though that's a detail and it does not matter for now. \r\n\r\nI'll try to come back to review this as soon as possible, though I'm quite busy this week, so I can't promise. \r\n\r\nFrom a quick read that looks great, I just need to understand it, and find out how to fix the tests. \r\n\r\nThanks !"
