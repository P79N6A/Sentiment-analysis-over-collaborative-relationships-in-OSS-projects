A \"universal console\" sort of project, with a declarative layer to quickly fit any language, would be an interesting idea but going well beyond the scope of a GSoC-sized project, may be.\n"

Either because there are requirement with the Sloan grant, or because we are ourselves student and/or don't have time to be a mentor. \n\nWe'll soon release a roadmap for the next 2 years and what would be the things that can be tackled by the core team and what will not.  Allow easier custom kernel of other language is on the list, but writing them is definitely not.\n\nAlso things like separate kernel will gain a lot (especially at the beginning) to be separate. IPython is big and slow to release, and PR will take time to merge. Still if you write a different kernel, we'll be happy to advertise it. \n"

    "body": "Thanks. I had understood correctly the part about kernels being possibly remote (as in \"run on separate machines), but I confess that I have been lacking a digest about what a \"kernel\" really is (pointers to documentation are welcome).\n\nNow, from that last comment is a \"kernel\" seems to be an application listening and emitting messages (with an ipython-specific communication protocol). That would mean that an R kernel as you think of would be R code implementing that communication protocol (and run an application that uses it).\n\nThe proposal here is that, whatever a kernel is, there is an implementation of it for the default interface to Python in iPython. Now, since rpy2 can embed R into a Python process and basically make the communication between both seamless,  the idea was to use that for making an R console usable from iPython with a close to minimal effort. From the top of my head what would need to be tweaked is: \n- syntax highlighting (I contributed to pygments a lexer for R/S years back and it is still there, that should be enough) \n- autocompletion (expected to be minimal)\n- help system (rpy2 has feature to fetch R's man pages)\n- magics (In R, '%' can used for operators)\n"
