    "body": "After thinking more about this, I don't think this is a good idea. I think regular ImportError tracebacks are probably the best form for this information to take. Sometimes ImportErrors raise when there are environment or configuration problems, rather than the package merely being missing. These ImportErrors can be informative. It would be bad for us to silence these, and extremely complicated to try to do the right thing.\n\nI don't think we can reasonably improve upon ImportErrors, and adding things like 'pip install' messages would add lots of cruft to our own code, because we would import all of our dependencies separately.\n"
