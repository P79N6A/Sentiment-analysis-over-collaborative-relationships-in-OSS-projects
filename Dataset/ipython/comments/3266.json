    "body": "This is terrific work @Zsailer! I began to use it last week to build a notebook plugin for Spyder and I'm really happy with the results. The things that this branch will let us do are exactly what we need to provide a more desktop-friendly environment for the notebook.\n\nBut I would like to ask you: how is this progressing? I'm using your multidir branch (because this one seems outdated) but today I noticed you have a new multidir-sess branch where your last commits seem to be going. Should I use that instead?\n\nAnother thing is that I saw in the dev meeting this morning that you're considering to leave this work for 2.0. So if you need any help to test this, so it can be in 1.0 (which would be really good for us), please let me know, I'll happy to help.\n"

    "body": "@ccordoba12 Thank you! I am glad this has been working well for you. This is something we are really excited about for the future of IPython. Unfortunately, trying to implement this forced us to deal with other issues in the server-side of the notebook that is making us weary of releasing it too soon (namely, removing \"notebook_id\", an immutable pointer to the notebook. Things get tricky when mapping kernels to notebooks when the name of the notebook can change). \n\nThe multidir branch will allow you to navigate through your directories, but it breaks when connecting to a kernel. Also, you cannot open notebook names with spaces yet (this is a silly, quick fix I'll correct soon).\n\nThe multidir-sess branch is the most current version, but it broken for sure. I am working on the notion of adding \"sessions\" to the notebook, which hold the mapping between the notebook and kernels. In the future, these will hold more information. My goal is to have this working before our dev meeting next Thursday. I'll leave a comment here if I can get something working sooner. Until then, I'd avoid using this branch...\n\nWe would like to add this to 1.0, and we will have a lot better idea of whether that's possible by next Thursday. We just want to make sure we do this right. Once we get a working version out, we'd like to hear your feedback on how it works! \n"
