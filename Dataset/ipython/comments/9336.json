    "body": "> The attributes on an SList are for rejoining it with different separators, rather than for splitting it.\n\nYes, and `LSString` has attributes for splitting.\n\n> I don't think splitting on a null byte is common enough to build in, but it should be a one-liner where you want it:\n\nI'm a little surprised to hear this. Imho it is very common to do this. Many unix utilities, like find (`-print0`), grep (`-z`/`-Z`) and xargs (`-0`) support flags to print and consume output separated by null bytes, which people (should) always use when e.g. dealing with filenames (since filenames in unix systems can contain newlines) or with any kind of multiline records.\n\nWhen IPython is used as a shell script replacing bash, utilities like this have to be as easy and convenient as possible.\n\nAs a side note, is it possible to obtain the output of a `!` command as a `LSString`? It seems only `SList`s are returned by default.\n"

As soon as filenames contain whitespace you need something like this. An alternative way to do it is by explicitly telling `xargs` to split on newlines, like `xargs -d '\\n', but _that_ I've never seen someone doing before :D\n"
