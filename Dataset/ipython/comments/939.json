But the IPython kernel doesn't pass the equivalent argument when it instantiates the ZMQInteractiveShell.\n\nI don't know what the best way to deal with this is. The Application, which has the correct profile info, is a layer removed from the Shell (which needs that info) by the Kernel. Do we pass the information through the kernel, or change the profile dir after the shell has been instantiated?\n"

I can start the qtconsole just fine, and both front and backend share the profile, no matter how or if I set it (python 2.7).\n\nCan you print `sys.argv` and `get_ipython().config` in the kernel?\n\nI cannot test the qtconsole with Python 3, because I don't have working pyqt on Python 3.\n\nSide note: I would actually argue that we should _remove_ the different default profile behavior.  I imagine that config that is not valid in both is relatively rare, and users with sufficiently complex config that it does conflict, who _also_ regularly use IPython in both py3 and py2 (all 5 of them), should manually specify a different profile when they use IPython with the Python they use less.\n\nI would also rather _not_ have my history separate for the two, because code that is not valid in both is rare, and I would much rather tweak the code that needs small adjustments from my history than retype it all over again.\n\nI think this made sense when py3k support was off in a testing branch, but now that it is in trunk we should stop doing it.\n"
