This PR will probably need some history cleanup before merging, because unfortunately the current history is a bit of a mess and it touches files that shouldn't have been modified in the first place.  But don't worry: we'll be happy to give you a hand with that, the first priority is to get the (extremely important) tab functionality working robustly, we're very excited to see progress on this front.\n\nWe'll be playing with this over the next few days and providing you with more specific feedback.  Thanks for contributing!\n"

The tutorials\nat github are in general pretty good, and I have some additional links\nto git resources here: http://fperez.org/py4science/git.html\n\nYou'll want to rebase this branch, removing the commits that are\nirrelevant and leaving no merges from the main repo, so that we can\nevaluate only your new changes in isolation from anything else that\nhappened in the project.\n\nYou can make a 'backup' branch easily by creating a new branch off\nthis one in your local repo before starting the rebase process.  That\nway if you make a mistake, it's trivial to find again the point where\nyou started (it's always possible to do so, as git doesn't destroy\nyour data, but having a named backup makes it easiear and less scary).\n"

Not sure about this one.\n"
