    "body": "@ellisonbg \n\nYes I believe you can also have collisions with HTML and JavaScript generated in cells.\n\n(Sorry most of my examples are in R, because that is what I'm more familiar with)\n\nThe difference, I think, is that usually when using HTML or Javascript, the user finely \ncontrols the HTML or JS output. Either they generate it directly or use a package (such as\nR xtable to generate an html table). In both cases the user or the package expect\nthe generated content to be inlined in a larger document, so they are good citizens\nand do not pollute the namespace.\n\nThe problem with SVG is that most of the time, it's not inlined but embeded (as an external image).\nTherefore the packages do not particularly care about generating unique ids.\nLet me give you a concrete example, when using R in the notebook I may type:\n\n``` r\n%%R\nrequire(ggplot2)\nggplot(data = data.frame(x = runif(1000)), aes(x=x)) + geom_histogram()\n```\n\nto generate an histogram of a 1000 uniform sampling.\nIf the default device is svg, the produced SVG is going to contain a set of\nsymbol definitions such as\n\n``` svg\n<symbol overflow=\"visible\" id=\"glyph0-1\">\n<path style=\"stroke:none;\" d=\"M 2.640625 -6.796875 ... \"/>\n</symbol>\n```\n\nNow if in the next cell I plot a second figure, the name `glyph0-1` is going to be reused by\nggplot, because it does not know that the SVGs are inlined in the same document\nand does not need to produce unique identifiers. The user has no control over this.\n\nThe same problem may happen when the user includes multiple SVG figures from a foreign URL link.\nBecause different foreign sources created the SVGs, it's highly possible to have id collisions.\n\nA thourough discussion of the issue is available in the original issue  #1866 \n"

    "body": "The rational was mostly that the problem of scoping does not apply only to svg, but things like html/javascript (example, `cython -a` leaks css into main namespace), and might be frontend specific. Even if we **do** consider this as bugs in underlying library, the use case is high enough to add this option. The need to make the flag global also come from the fact that we will allow arbitrary mimetype also. \n\nThere was arguing that then people just had to publish iframe themselves, but then you cannot use thoses iframes in nbconvert except for html. \n\nSeeing that publishing with display can carry along arbitrary metadata, we think that the notebook frontend can look at those metadata, and if the metadata tells the output need \"protection\"  it will be wrapped in an iframe.\n\nIt compares to other solution in the sens that : \n- it is global for all display types.\n- it can completely get ignored by the frontend.\n- it does not change the payload.\n- it does not assume a specific way an element will be _protected_. for now, we will use iframes.\n"
