    "body": "This is not an ipython bug, but likely a bug in the readline/libedit library in your system.  IPython has no C code at all in it, so it can't really cause directly this kind of C-level error.  But we've seen in the past bugs in readline, especially with respect to threads, that causes these.\n\nUnfortunately you'll have to track it down with Python/readline directly, I'm afraid...\n"
