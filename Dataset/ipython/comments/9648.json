But that's the price to pay to not depend on readline anymore. It does that automatically if not a TTY. \n\nSide info:\n- The available themes are dynamics so might vary on your system. \n- docstrings could list themes, but Dynamics docstrings are a pain on Python 2, if at all possible. \n- We [are discussing](https://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/726#issuecomment-227503678) a set of themes that include completion menu, prompt ... etc to share across many projects, we would like to have designer working on that. I've pinged Brian on a few issues so see if we could borrow student, but he so far did not replied. \n  - Some of the readability issues of color and design of above theme that suit everyone requires a new release of pygments. \n  - getting _exactly_ the same themes as IPython 4.x without a new pygments is close to impossible, or the required solution is not worth the effort. \n"

    "body": "For the record on this issue, we seem to have a good compromise solution to ensure we don't break existing habits/aliases/etc...  The `--colors` option will map to hardcoded colors for lightbg/linux + a choice of pygments theme ('default' for 'lightbg' and 'monokai' for 'linux').  This will ensure prompt and color readability with the old choices, while allowing users to do full-blown theme selection if desired with the highlight style options.\n"
