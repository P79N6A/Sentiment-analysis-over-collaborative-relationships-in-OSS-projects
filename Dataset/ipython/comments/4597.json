    "body": "It was a long discussion about that in this PR #4356... the fragments were thought as a cell property, and not as a meta cell property (I mean encompassing multiple cells).\nCurrently I am testing some options to deal with this issue (which I think yet it is not a bug ;-)), with less associated costs in the sense of the complexity added to get it solved. First, I need to get some other slideshow-related things get done (merged) before applying this one.\n\nAs a workaround until we get there, you can make the second chuck of code a Fragment (to appear after the first fragment) or make this group a new Sub-slide.\n"
