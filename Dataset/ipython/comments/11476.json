(That is unless there is interest for someone to maintain 6.x, but the current core dev are doing that on their free time and already plenty to do).\r\n\r\nBut in general yes as an open source project we only support the latest branch (in this case 7.x) and use the latest unless you you really need to stick to an old one. If you need support for an old version you can also discuss support with Anaconda Inc."
