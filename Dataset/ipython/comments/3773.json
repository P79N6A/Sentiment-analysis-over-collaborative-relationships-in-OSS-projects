    "body": "It is not even that it is complicated.  We used to load the notebook\nincrementally and the user experience was horrlble.  When you are dumping\ncontent on the page, a user can't really do anything with it and a very\njarring/jumpy feel is created.  I have some ideas that I might try, but I\nthink this is very low priority.  Also, much of the wait you experience\nwith a large notebook is simply the network load time - we can't do\nanything about that.\n\nOn Thu, Jul 25, 2013 at 9:22 AM, David Sanders notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> I did not doubt that it would complicated, but it is definitely desirable!\n> \n> On Thu, Jul 25, 2013 at 9:18 AM, Matthias Bussonnier <\n> notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> > This is actually more complicated than that.
