Other \npython installations (different python versions, virtualenv or conda environments) can \nbe installed as kernels by following these steps:\n* make sure that ipython is run with the desired python installation \n  (e.g. activate the environment) \n* make sure that ipython is installed \n* run once `ipython kernelspec install-self --user` (or `ipython2 ...` or `ipython3 ...`)\n\nThe last command installs a kernel spec for the current python installation files in \n~/.ipython/kernels. Kernel spec files are jsons files, which can be change with a \nnormal text editor.\n\nKernels for other languages can be found _here_. They usually come with instruction what to \nrun to make the kernel available in the notebook.\n\n```\n"
