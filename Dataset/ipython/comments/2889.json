    "body": "A couple of other points:\n\nThe pandas function has a parameter `string_as_factors`, which will convert columns of strings into R factors. That defaults to False (and this code uses the default for now), but when you load an R data.frame using `read.csv()`, string columns are treated as factors by default. Maybe the latter behaviour is more expected?\n\nDataframes converted like this show up slightly differently from dataframes loaded in R. A numeric column from the `str()` (structure) of each:\nLoaded in R:\n`$ samples: int  1 13 4 28 48 68 1 21 6 12 ...`\nConverted:\n`$ samples:Class 'AsIs'  num [1:69] 1 13 4 28 48 68 1 21 6 12 ...`\n\nIn my admittedly very brief tests, this doesn't seem to affect using the data, so I haven't followed it up. It may well be that it's an issue for pandas.\n"

    "body": "> Great, I agree that it makes sense to have the conversion in rpy2. Is that in current releases, or is it something you're working on for a future release?\n\nCurrently it is not in the code base (I'd need to add few bells and whistles, and the reverse conversion). Since the dev version of rpy2 is currently only targeting Python 3 and I am unsure about how well pandas is playing with Python 3 (last time I checked, around Christmas, numpy could not be installed on Python 3.3 here), a practical solution to get that to most users quickly is a bugfix release to the 2.3.x series of rpy2. This will be similar to the numpy conversion module in rpy2 (`pandas` not required for rpy2 to function, and the optional conversion can started with an import and a call to a function to activate it - that function can in turn be used by pandas, ipython, or other code to activate the conversion by default).\n\n> Does the custom converter you've linked to have any advantage over the code we're currently using in pandas? It looks more or less equivalent.\n\nGiven that the few reports about pandas DataFrame objects not working with rpy2, I'd think that one advantage is that this code is working(and will be covered by unit tests once in the rpy2 code base). An other advantage is that the conversion is automatic at the `rpy2.robjects` layer (see examples in the SO answer). \n"

So I guess we'd want something like\n\n```\nif 'pandas' in sys.modules:\n    pandas2ri.activate()\n```\n\nIs it safe and quick to call that on each call to rmagic, or should we also check whether it's already activated?\n\nThen again, pandas is quickly becoming pretty essential for data analysis in Python, so maybe it's not such a big problem to try to load it when rmagic is loaded.\n"

    "body": "This is functionality that I'd really like to see. Would it be acceptable to add a configuration option to enable it? That would deal with @takluyver's concerns about dependencies / extra cruft during rmagic loading. Swapping out the numpy2ri code for the following doesn't work:\n\n```\nfrom rpy2.robjects import pandas2ri\npandas2ri.activate()\n```\n\nThis is due to `pyconverter` getting set to `np.asarray` in the `__init__`. So, I think this is a trivial change to do with a config option (`np.asarray` can be replaced with a null-op for pandas objects). But don't want to work on a clean solution if it's going to be rejected. In that case, I'll just make a quick hack for myself for now.\n"

I need to get back to this, and integrate it with rpy2's pandas2ri/numpy2ri stuff properly, so that it doesn't conflict.\n\nMaking it a configuration option feels like a poor workaround, to be honest. If it's off by default, hardly anyone gets the benefit. If it's on by default, most users pay the performance cost anyway. My current thinking is that we may as well just let rmagic try to import pandas. It's only a one-off cost per kernel, and I think a lot of people using rmagic will be using pandas anyway, because DataFrame is so similar to R's data.frame.\n"
