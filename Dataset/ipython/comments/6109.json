    "body": "I think the problem here is that multiprocessing on Unix uses fork() by default to start the worker processes. Mixing forking (used by multiprocessing) and threading (used by IPython/ZMQ) is not necessarily supposed to work in the first place (see e.g. [this bug](http://bugs.python.org/issue8713)). It's possible that the `ZMQError` is due to there being two copies of ZMQ trying to connect to the same port after the fork.\n\nIf you're using Python 3.4, multiprocessing [can now avoid forking by using the \"forkserver\" or \"spawn\" start methods](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html#whatsnew-multiprocessing-no-fork). I've checked that your example fails for me (IPython master, Python 3.4, Ubuntu 14.04), but adding either\n\n``` python\nmultiprocessing.set_start_method('spawn')\n```\n\nor\n\n``` python\nmultiprocessing.set_start_method('forkserver')\n```\n\nbefore importing the example in the IPython notebook makes it work fine.\n\nIt may be possible to make IPython \"fork-safe\" -- for example, the original discussion in [this bug](http://bugs.python.org/issue8713) was about making the `logging` module work with fork -- but I don't know what this would involve.\n"

I hope to do a more realistic test for my use case later, but this might be a good workaround for pythons < 3.4 without this [feature](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html#whatsnew-multiprocessing-no-fork).\n"
