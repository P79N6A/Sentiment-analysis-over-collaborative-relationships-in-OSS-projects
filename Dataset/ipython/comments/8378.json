    "body": "> This is a bit tricky, because the name is actually picked when you create a notebook, and used in the URL\n\nI see, however the user can choose to rename at any time, so we could just simulate a rename. And since he didn't pick the generated name in first place he will not mind if ipython does that automatically once it knows better (i.e. some content has been entered).\n\n> I think it would be reasonable to look for a title in the first markdown cell\n\nI guess that would be a fair start. I'm not sure how this applies to most users, however most of my notebooks are for dev work and don't have a markdown cell. they generally all have a comment line at the top though...  \n\nanyhow, I considered it would be difficult to get this right in general/multiple languages, hence the idea for the lambda/callable in `ipython_notebook_config.AUTOSAVE_NAMING`, so it would be easy to adjust for one's own style. Or whatever better approach you see fit to achieve the same...\n"
