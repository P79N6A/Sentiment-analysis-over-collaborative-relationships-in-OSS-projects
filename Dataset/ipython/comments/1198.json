    "body": "Without injecting some debugging statements it's a bit hard to tell, but the way the heartbeat works in the notebook is this:\n\nThe kernel manager sends a ping every so often (in this case every `time_to_dead` in seconds), and if it doesn't receive a reply by the time it would send out the next ping, it believes the kernel is dead.  The kernel remains responsive, even during GIL-holding blocking code, because its responder is actually an extremely tiny pure-C 0MQ thread.\n\nLooking at the code, I can see two problems:\n1. (this is most likely the cause of your issue) The heartbeat mechanism starts right away when the kernel subprocess is initiated.  So if the kernel isn't up and running and responsive within `time_to_dead`, then it will fail to make the first heartbeat, and essentially be treated as DOA.\n2. (unlikely issue, but still a bug) if the _server_ is slow, it might queue up the heart-failed action while a heartbeat reply is waiting in the queue (hb_stream is not flushed, as it is in the parallel code's more elaborate heartbeat mechanism).  But that would require some seriously heavy load on the server.\n\nI was able to replicate (as far as I can tell) your issue by cutting the heartbeat time down to 300 milliseconds, so my notebook keeps seeing dead kernels.  But if I delay the _first_ heartbeat for the original 3 seconds, I once again have a perfectly responsive kernel.  So the solution here is that we need to allow user-configurable delay on the first beat, and it should probably start out around 5s, which should cover any normal environment.\n"
