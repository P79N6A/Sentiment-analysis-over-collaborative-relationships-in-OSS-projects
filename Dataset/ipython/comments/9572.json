    "body": "I didn't test it, but don't merge it like that. `eager=True` means that it will replace other key bindings that start with escape. This means that key bindings like `meta-b`, `meta-l'', `meta-f` etc... won't work anymore. The reason is that when alt is pressed in front of a key binding, a VT terminal sends two keys through the input. Esc + the actual key. So pressing escape, followed by 'b' is the same as typing `alt-b`.\n\nThis is also the reason that there is a delay after escape. If a normal escape has been pressed and nothing follows right after it. (There is a small timer), then we consider it a normal `escape` press. This timeout is also noticeable when using Vim and going back to navigation mode.\n\nFor Vi users, it would be very confusing to have esc just hide the completion menu. It can do that as well, but it should at least go to navigation mode. For Emacs users, you want to make sure not to shadow all the other meta-style key bindings. It could work by chaining the `HasCompletions` filter: https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/master/prompt_toolkit/filters/cli.py#L79\n\nBecause of this complexity, I preferred to have `Ctrl-G` to hide the completion menu. I think this is what Emacs is doing.\n"
