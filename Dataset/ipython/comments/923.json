    "body": "Moving discussion from #903 to here (PR), pinging @fperez and @ellisonbg to keep conversation updates linked up.\n\nI've renamed InlineBackendConfig -> InlineBackend (with warning on old name, for any of those still lingering on it).\n\nHere's a quick question:  Should we switch the inline figure default back to svg from png?  PNG is the default, because it's a good deal sharper, and for figure snobs it does look better than SVG.  However, it is less capable, in that the SVG+XHTML export will lack figures in the default state (see #735).  Since it's easy to change the figure format, maybe we should change the default to the more capable one, and let the nicer-looking format be configurable?  \n\nA possible issue would be that the svg dpi is tuned such that svg and png figures are the same size in the QtConsole, but I find that they are _not_ the same in a browser using the notebook, and the png size is more sensible.  It is also true that png is just a much more portable and reliable (if not editable) format.\n"

After some initial weird glitching, that went away with a pyc cleanout, all looks good now so I think it's good to merge.\n\nI'm going to leave the image default discussion to happen separately so we don't hold this PR forever, made #944 for that.\n\nMerging now, thanks for the great work!  This wil be very useful.\n\nFinal comment: adding mention of `%config` to the main configuration section in the docs is probably a good idea.  Since that would be a docs-only patch, just go ahead and commit it any time if you get a chance (and if you can't do it now, let me know and I can take a crack at it later).  But I'll merge the code now.\n"
