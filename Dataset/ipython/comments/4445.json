I dont know sorry :( Because i'm newbie\n\nDepend on your OS and how you installed in the first place. \nUsually you can upgrade by the same way you installed the first time (and that should be the prefered way)\n\nIf it is not available through the usual distribution channel, you should be able to install using `pip` (the python package manager), it can only install the python-side of IPython dependency, but if 0.13 is working, then 1.1 should work. so `pip install ipython` should be enough. \n\nFor nbconvert, depending on your notebooks, you might need to install a program called [`pandoc`](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html).\n\nI'm going to close the issue, but feel free to continue to ask question. \nIf you have issues, you can also join the mailing list, the chat etc, see [ipython.org](http://ipython.org/) comunity section in the sidebar.\n"
