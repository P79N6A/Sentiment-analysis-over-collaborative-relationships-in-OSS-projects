    "body": "All I can do is describe the symptoms. Ipython is running on the head node of a cluster, both the notebook server and the kernels. I'm accessing it through ssh tunneling; only port 8888 is tunnelled, so that connections to localhost:8888 emerge as connections from the cluster machine to its own localhost:8888. This has been working for at least a week. Today, whenever I tried to work with a notebook with markdown cells, the browser window would crash.\n\nSpecifically, whether or not there was any math on the page, I'd get a little box in the lower right informing me \"Failed to load ...\" and a partially-numeric URL I haven't yet been able to decipher, because the box is then replaced with one saying it is rendering the math and is at 0%. At that point or shortly after, I stop being able to even scroll the window. A few minutes later, Chromium informs me that the window, and also the notebook server, and sometimes some other tabs (maybe whatever else is in the same Chromium process?) have become unresponsive, and would I like to kill them? I can tell from my laptop fan that the CPU is working hard. \n\nThe ipython version is 0.13.2.rc2. Chromium is version (good God) 25.0.1364.160-0ubuntu0.12.10.1 .\n\nIf I had to guess, for some reason the local mathJax is not working, and the web-based mathJax is causing some sort of problem; perhaps it just changed? I haven't run into mathJax problems anywhere else.\n"
