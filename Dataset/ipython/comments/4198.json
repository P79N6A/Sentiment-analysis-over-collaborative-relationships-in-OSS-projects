    "body": "OK I had a pretty close look at the core APIs in this PR. I think it looks good. I like the idea of having separate `upgrade` and `downgrade` functions for the two directions as the logic will be pretty different. I think that moving forward (not in this PR) we want to make sure our APIs define very clearly the difference between the in memory JSON versus the on disk JSON. That is not at all apparent in the `to_notebook_json` method right now. But overall I am +1 on merging this. \n"
