We had a nice recap of @fperez yesterday night that told us that he completly remember this afternoon of 12 years ago, when he read this new feature that python just added ('sys.displayhook') and though that it could use that to have prompt and history. Wherease he had no idea wether this would be possible in perl or other. the he thought \"I'll spend an afternoon on that\" ....I won't spoil the rest of the story, I'll let hit re-told it when we've took over the world.\n"
