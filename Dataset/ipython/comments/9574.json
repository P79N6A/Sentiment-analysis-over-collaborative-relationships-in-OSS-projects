    "body": "`Ctrl+Space` is exactly the same as `Ctrl-Escape` for a terminal. (On Windows, not necessarily, but prompt-toolkit assumes internally a Vt100 terminal, because this is the most common.)\n\nBy default, we use Emacs key bindings, which is also what readline does. (Readline does not implement all Emacs key bindings, this one for instance is not supported by readline.)\nBut in Emacs, pressing this key sequence will enter selection mode.\n\n`pgcli` attached a custom key binding to `ControlSpace`: https://github.com/dbcli/pgcli/blob/master/pgcli/key_bindings.py#L65\n\nI leave it up to the IPython core developers to decide what should happen when this is pressed. Maybe it can be configurable. In prompt-toolkit itself, this won't change for now.\n\nFYI: Emacs style copy/paste key bindings are as follows:\n- `CtrlSpace`: Enter selection mode.\n- `Ctrl-W`: Cut\n- `Meta-W`: Copy\n- `Ctrl-Y`: Paste\n- `Ctrl-C >`: Indent selection\n- `Ctrl-C <`: Unindent selection\n- `Ctrl-G`: Cancel selection mode.\n\nBy the way, people really use these key bindings, e.g.:\nhttps://github.com/xonsh/xonsh/issues/1074#issuecomment-223625302\n\nEdit: added the key bindings for indent/unindent: these can be useful in particular when working with larger chunks of input.\n"

    "body": "While the default mode of readline is emacs-like, it's a very reduced set of shortcuts which many of us (myself included) tend to think of as 'terminal shortcuts', because readline is so ubiquitous. So implementing more of the emacs shortcuts is a clear win for Emacs users, but more dubious for those of us who are neither familiar with emacs nor such keen vi users that we change the editing mode.\n\nMaybe there should be an 'emacs-lite' editing mode which disables some of these less familiar emacs features? On the other hand, having the shortcuts there allows us to start using them if we learn them.\n\n@klonuo why did you hit Ctrl-Space? I don't think that was a shortcut in IPython before - were you expecting it to do something, running on muscle memory from another program, or just hitting a wrong key by mistake?\n\nAnother approach would be to add a bottom bar which, in selection mode, would change to say e.g. \"Selection mode; Ctrl-G to exit\". That's probably something that we'd do after 5.0, though.\n"
