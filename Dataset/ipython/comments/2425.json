    "body": "Thanks a lot @takluyver for having us in mind! Things in our front have \nnot been progressing as rapidly as for you guys, but we are coming there :-)\n\nFirst, let me clarify what Pierre meant in that post. Given that you \nchanged how gui event loops are handled in >=0.11, the solution we had \nfor 0.10, i.e. embedding terminal IPython using `InteractiveShellEmbed`, \nwas not technically possible anymore. I don't know the full details, but \nthat's what Pierre explained to me.\n\nThe next logical step was to try to embed qtconsole, which he did \nshortly afterwards. The integration started as a mere proof of concept \nand has continued to improve over time (especially since you released \n0.12). With Spyder 2.1.11 you can open several consoles at once, send \ncode from the editor to them and inspect the current namespace using our \nvariable explorer.\n\nAs for Python(x,y), well I'm not a developer of it, but I think Pierre \nis waiting for Spyder 2.2 to be ready to do the switch to 0.13. That's \nbecause we've been working really hard to provide a nice and rich way to \nconfigure qtconsole using our Preferences page and minimal terminal \neffort. I'm quite happy with what we have accomplished: every console \ncan be configured separately, the user can choose the font, pager and \ncompletion widget sytle, decide if he wants pylab or not and which \nbackend to use, interrupt and restart the kernel, and a couple more \nthings, all inside Spyder.\n\nI'm also happy to say that we are about to finish our integration (right \nnow I'm working to let users select a profile, and there are some more \nthings left). However, it'll be great if you guys could download our \ndefault repo, and make us suggestions and/or corrections of what we have \ndone so far. We also have a couple of doubts about your API, and this \nissue seems the perfect place to solve them. I'll post them in the next \nfew days.\n\nSo many thanks again for bringing the issue forward, and I hope you like \nour integration.\n\nEl 23/09/12 16:12, Thomas Kluyver escribió:\n\n> Pinging @ccordoba12 https://github.com/ccordoba12\n> \n> In a blog post \n> http://spyder-ide.blogspot.co.uk/2011/09/no-ipython-v011-support-in-spyders.html \n> last year, Pierre Raybaud said \"The more I think about it (and the \n> more I spend time on it), the more I doubt that there will ever be a \n> decent support of IPython >=v0.11 in Spyder's console.\" We assume this \n> is also why Python(x,y) ships with a version of IPython based on the \n> old 0.10 series.\n> \n> We liaise with them and work out any issues to ensure that Spyder can \n> effectively use a newer version.

    "body": "@takluyver, I think we are ready for a little advice about your API. Here are my questions:\n1. Do we need to subclass `IPythonQtConsoleApp` as we did [here](http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/source/browse/spyderlib/widgets/ipython.py#204) just so we can create kernel managers and new widgets that use them for each one of our frontends?\n2. Do we need to initialize the app before doing this? We defined a new method to do it [here](http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/source/browse/spyderlib/widgets/ipython.py#206) but we are not using it because we are unsure if it's necessary or not.\n3. Does `BaseIPythonApplication.initialize` and `IPythonConsoleApp.initialize` do something else than reading your config files, i.e. ipython_config.py, etc?\n\nWe'd really appreciate your help and suggestions, because we are about to release 2.2 and want it to be rock solid! :-)\n"

    "body": "1. That depends on what you need it to do.  If it needs to do anything differently not exposed by config, then yes.  I expect you will.\n2. It makes very little sense to have an Application without initializing it.  initialize is basically everything.  Generally to customize behavior, you override initialize in a subclass to do different things.\n3. BaseIPApp loads config, ConsoleApp creates a KernelManager and starts a Kernel.  If you don't want these to happen, then don't call them (BaseIPApp is probably important, ConsoleApp may not be).\n\nInitialize is where approximately everything happens when creating an IPython Application.  There are three steps to start any IPython app:\n1. app = AppClass.instance() # creates the app\n2. app.initialize([argv]) # reads config, instantiates objects - pretty much everything\n3. app.start() # begins eventloop, usually trivial\n\nIf I understand correctly, your app subclass should look something like:\n\n``` python\nclass IPythonApp(IPythonQtConsoleApp):\n    def initialize(self, argv=None):\n        BaseIPythonApplication.initialize(self, argv=argv)\n        # disable creation of first KernelManager/Kernel, qt elements, and signal handlers\n\n...\napp = IPythonApp()\napp.initialize(['--pylab', 'inline'])\nwidget = app.new_ipywidget()\n```\n\nThat said, since you use approximately nothing of the configuration,\nit may make more sense to skip the Application subclass altogether,\nand just create KernelManagers and widgets directly.\n"
