    "body": "So `IPython.Completer` is gone now.  I think this could affect @gibiansky,  @BayardRock and in julia I suppose @malmaud that deal with codemirrors modes IIRC. \n\nJust to keep you guys updated why this. Current completer was completely broken (preventing user to type) So I had to re-write most if not all of the things.\n\nFirst thing, if you extend `CodeCell.options_default.cm_config.extraKeys` with something like `\"'$'\": \"completePassthrough\"` (yes single quote in double quote) it will invoke the completer on `$` **and insert** `$`. It interesses some of you right ?\nIt is also much more easier to re-bind `Tab` to another shortcut.\n\nSecond `<Tab><Tab>` now with **codemirror Master** complete to longuestCommonSubstring, not only dealing with percent in `%magics` I think this should be tested. It fallback to pick current result on CM < 3.21.\n\nThird, completion does not include analysis of surrounding tokens anymore for the time beeing, I'll need to rework some of the internal to allow that again.\n\n@ellisonbg I still need help when completer is dismissed with `esc` not to switched to command mode. \n\nThis is a lot of change close to release but I think it is needed and the experience is much better that current and old completer.\n\nThis also layout ground to allow things like modification of completer like [IfSharp](https://github.com/BayardRock/IfSharp) does (icon in front of completion + tooltip for currently highlighted completion)\n\nPlease test and feedback ! Thanks !\n"

    "body": "With master codemirror this should mostly work and be (depending on use cases) being equivalent to previous completer on 95% of cases.\n\nThe few edge cases I can think of are : \n- longuest common substring (lcs) is not at the beginning of the completions:\n  - `pandas.sandbox.<tab>` show `pandas` and `sandbox`, lcs is `and` so tab once more complete to `pandas.sandbox.and`. In the other end you cannot force the lcs to start at beginning of word as you want the lcs of `%matplotlib` and `matplotlib` to be matplotlib and not empty string. Problem would be worse with subsequence instead of substring, but calculating the LCS of more than 2 string is hard one could calculate the LCS only on the union of `from:to:` range by extending the current completion with adjacent token but it's a small project on itself.\n- (current) lcs might not make sens on completion that do not have the same `from:to:` range and might be overzealous at replacing something it shouldn't, or not replacing it were it should have. I have no real world example, but I suppose we could come up with cases were `numpy.random.norm<tab><tab>` would complete to `numpy.normal` (dropping random, even maybe numpy) or to `numpy.random.numpy.random.normal`.\n\nThere are other annoying related things due to the fact that completion from the kernel do not come with a `from:to:` range and I use heuristics, so I'm not sure it is worth trying to that right now.\n"
