    "body": "This PR makes the behavior of creating a bdist less consistent because the resulting bdist is different depending on the computer building the bdist. In master, bdists always have the same dependencies, regardless of the compiling host. There is a fundamental difference between installing from sdists and bdists because when installing from sdist, the environment can be checked at the destination. With bdists, dependencies are computed without sufficient knowledge of the destination, so the least common denominator choice is taken.\n\nSince IPython actually only cares about _wheel_ bdists, and pip-accel uses bdist_dumb for some reason, if you change the check from `startswith('bdist')` to `== 'bdist_wheel'`, it should serve both our purposes.\n"

Last weekend I came to the same conclusion: The goal of ba0cd52c8b0c5cfa1fc35b1ddda40c7b2972474d seemed to be to make sure that binary _wheels_ would be generated including the proper dependencies (which makes sense of course). I'll change the pull request.\n"
