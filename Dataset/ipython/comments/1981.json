In zsh you need `&!` for bash's behavior.\n\n@takluyver Yes, I think that's reasonable behavior.\n\n@minrk I guess you need multiprocessing for 1.  I think 2 is the current status and probably a good default.\n\nBut I think having terminate-on-exit option would be nice.  What do you think?  Or more in general, `%onexit` magic to register hook would be nice.  So that you can do something like this:\n\n```\nIn [1]:\n%%sh --proc p\nsleep long time\n\nIn [2]:\n%onexit p.kill()\n```\n"
