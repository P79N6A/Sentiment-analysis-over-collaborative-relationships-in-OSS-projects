    "body": "I don't think that would work.  The point is that here, I cannot enter a '-' without pressing [Alt], even if the keycode for the minus is correct.  Basically, the problem is that the shortcut is \"X+Y\", which assumes that X and Y can still be used and pressed independently.\n\nFrom my understanding of keyboards, drivers, scancodes etc., one should either\n- use only scancodes, i.e. refer to hardware keys, which makes sense for games or the like, where you want to use a certain layout (i.e. assume that X is next to Y, without being able to know what is the \"meaning\" of X and Y in the current layout), or\n- use symbols that can be produced in various ways (which is what IPython mostly does, except for the modifiers).\n\nIOW, instead of referring to \"shift+slash\", refer to \"question mark\" (which is shift+slash in the US layout, but not in DE/QWERTZ, for instance), and IPython seems to do a good job here.  So I guess the fact that _shift is not a good modifier_ is more obvious than that _alt is not a good modifier_, which is also true. ctrl is fine as a modifier, AFAICS.\n"

    "body": "We have had extensive discussions about the frustrating nuances of keyboard events and browsers. In almost all cases, `keypress` event is what we want (this allows '?' instead of 'Shift-/'), but keypress events can only be trusted to fire on printable keys (not enter, arrows, esc, etc.). So we are presented with three basic choices:\n- use `keydown`, and deal with horrific localisation problems (current behavior, and simplest implementation)\n- use `keypress`, and not have any shortcuts on non-printing keys (no more Shift-Enter, etc., not really an option)\n- use `keypress` where we can, and `keydown` where we can't (This is what I hope to do, but it's too complicated to be done by 2.0. Maybe 2.1, though)\n\nSince we are using `keydown` for now, we just need to minimize the pain of the defaults in known cases. Perhaps moving split-cell to `Ctrl-Alt-minus` instead of just `Alt-minus` would be sufficient for now.\n"

    "body": "I agree with @minrk about the possible future directions for us.\n\nBut, there is an important thing to understand. Our keyboard shortcuts are key based, not character based. When you see a shortcut that says `-`, you shouldn't think \"the - character, which includes pressing alt on my keyboard\", you should think \"the physical key required to press -\".\n\nIt may be preferable for you to pick a different keyboard shortcut for split cell, however, it should work fine to use `Alt-minus` on your system, which means \"press the alt key with the minus key\". The reason it doesn't work is that the mapping between the character `-` and the keycode is different on your keyboard. Fixing that will also make this work.\n"
