    "body": "%paste is only defined for the terminal frontend, which doesn't appear to be listed in the API docs (I'm not sure why). But there's not much to document - just enter `%paste`.\n\nIt's quite tricky to handle indented code correctly at the terminal, where we're trying to do autoindentation at the same time. Pasting at the Qt console works perfectly. I'd like to see it work better in the terminal, but it's probably not high priority for any of the developers at the moment.\n"
