    "body": "In general we try to avoid cleaning up for the sake of cleaning up, it has many disadvantages: \r\n\r\n - It often prevent from backporting patches, as now there are conflicts. \r\n - It screw up git blame, and git bisect to find the root cause of a bug or the reason for change. \r\n - It often may look like the same code but there may be some subtle behavior changes that are hard to track down. \r\n\r\nEspecially since that both do some purely stylistic change and some code refactor I'm a bit worried. There is also some stylistic changes that are both incoherent with the rest of the codebase (and against pep8, but we only partially follow that.)\r\n\r\nI'll try to review the code inline. "
