    "body": "Thinking about this some more, I don't think jsonpatch is quite right for this, because applying the patch will fail if the server-side state is not as the client expects it (e.g. if you replace an item that another client removed, or add an item that another client added). What we want is more like a nested key-value store, where the operations are 'set key to value' and 'clear key', and they work regardless of the current state of the data, like `d[k] = v` and `d.pop(k, None)`.\n\nI could:\n1. Use jsonpatch, but write custom code to apply it in a way that won't fail. I don't think this is a good idea, but I include it for completeness.\n2. Use a syntax similar to jsonpatch (a list of operations), but with operations `set` and `clear` instead of `add`, `replace`, `remove` etc.\n3. Go back to some variant of the custom thing I was using before, where it sends a partial form of the content with `null` values indicating that a key should be removed.\n"

    "body": "Just thinking aloud here....\n- I think the main concept in our python config has worked really well. Namely that the top level of the config is simply a name of a class that will be configured. I think we should use this abstraction as well in the client so that the keys at the top level are not things like pages, but the actual names of the JS objects.\n- If we want to have a separate level of page configuration, we can allow a \"page\" to declare which JS objects are needed for that page. When the page is loaded a single call to the config API can grab the config set for all objects needed.\n- I think that our JS objects should take a `config` argument and that the config should be passed to children instances, which contain the config for those children.\n- +1 for the JS objects themselves having the config defaults.\n\nBasically, the summary is that I think we should simply use the same design as our Python config API (minus the traitlets part of it).\n"

    "body": "Over time, I think we are going to move to a design that makes our\ndifferent components (notebook, terminal, dashboard, text editor, variable\ninspector) more modular and isolated. We may end up making each of these\nthings separate repos and projects as we move to jupyter. This will ease\nthe burden for us to be all things to all people by making it easier for\ndifferent groups to build customized web-apps using our components. While I\nthink it is appropriate for us to have our config be \"page\" driven at the\ntop-level, I don't want us to make assumptions about which objects are on\nwhich pages. Our config REST API should be flexible enough to handle these\ncases. The Python config API is flexible in this way.\n\nI can imagine that it might be nice to have a layer of indirection between\nour class name and the names used in the config system, but I am afraid\nthat the same difficulties would arise when trying to refactor that mapping\nlayer.\n\nI do think there are good reasons to say that everything that needs config\nshould be a class. If config lives outside a class then so do defaults,\nwhich gets awkward. Another point that came up in NYC last week is the idea\nof using closures to isolate the private parts of our JS APIs. In that\ncontext each closure would return an object having the public API.\n\nOn Tue, Oct 21, 2014 at 11:28 AM, Thomas Kluyver notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Well, the _top_ level keys for our Python config are actually the\n> filenames, e.g. ipython_notebook_config, which apply to particular\n> applications.

I am really intrigued about omiscient.js and react.js react-cursor.js that are made almost completely around the principle on reacting on a change on a json-like structure. \n\nThe principle is that you expose this json structure only through the \"cursor\", and mutate it only through the cursor, which have the advantage that when you pass a subpart of the config to an objet if basically cannot walk \"up\" the config.\n\nSide note, I would be also really interested in looking at this to actually build the notebook interface.\nIt would mean that you basically only act on the json-document structure, and the UI update itself to reflect the changes. This also give you for free partial sync. \n\nThink [this](http://react-json-editor.bitballoon.com/examples/react-state-editor/webapp/) over websocket.\n"
