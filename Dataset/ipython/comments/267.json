Question: what should we do about the rest of the material here?\n\nhttp://ipython.scipy.org/moin/Documentation\n\nThere's all the stuff below the first header, and ideally we should keep all of this listed in a single location...  Should we just add all of that to the index.html?  I kind of hate editing html by hand for antyhing but trivial changes...\n\nBut in the long run, we really should keep a single docs page.  I see two options:\n- we port all that content to the index.html page by hand, and so be it.\n- we make the index page itself be sphinx-generated and edit reST sources.\n\nWhat do you think?\n"
