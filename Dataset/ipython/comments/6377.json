    "body": "> Do you want to write a nose testing framework for the python side of widgets?\n\nAs of now, I've been writing these in the CasperJS tests as embedded strings.  Each time I need to test something in Python, I run the string as a cell, use Python print, and then use JS to check the output of that cell.  It's ugly, painful, and brittle, but it works. :horse: \n"

We must not be echoing back the values after they're sent to the front-end, which is a good thing and is as designed. :smile: \n"
