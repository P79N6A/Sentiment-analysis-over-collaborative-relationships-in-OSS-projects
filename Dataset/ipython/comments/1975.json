The browser is stuck on OutputArea.prototype.append_display_data, on the this.element.append(toinsert) line.  (surprise, surprise)\n\nA solution might be to render the first couple of input cells, and beyond what appears on the first visible page, render remaining cells using a setTimeout, to decouple it from the UI thread.  A notebook could store geometry information for any long outputs or figures, and slowly load them in the background, possibly giving the user the option to \"click to load this figure\" before the background thread has gotten to it.\n\nAnother possibly useful concept is web workers:\nhttp://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/workers.html#workers\n"

    "body": "Ahh, OK, I read more carefully. Originally, I thought that the output scrolling solved the issue, but I guess it doesn't. We should probably be fairly aggressive about putting a hard upper limit on the size of output - hard truncation with a warning. Honestly, when the output gets so large that it can kill the browser, I am not sure it makes sense to give users any way to look at it. IOW, I think it is reasonable to warn and tell people to do something else with the data (redirect the file, store as a python variable, slice data, etc.).\n"
