    "body": "@v923z Can you try reinstalling ipython (doesn't matter if master or 1.1.0) and convert again?\n\nHm. I thought it had been established that the problem originates from pandoc. As for re-installation, I do that every morning when I check out the new code from github. But there is another machine, on which I installed ipython completely from scratch just two days ago (pulled code from github, version 2.0.0), and the problem still persists. pandoc version is 1.9.1.1.\n\nFor now, I can simply post-process the output (I have to remove &amp; only, I presume), so I can live with this. On the other hand, I guess, this has to be sorted out sooner or later...\n"

I finally managed to reproduce your issue with\n- xubuntu 12.04 - python 2.7 - ipython master - pandoc 1.9.1.1  \n  (all required packages are taken from the repository > sphinx, jinja2, pygments, tornado, pyzmq)\n\nSo maybe it is related to the \"old\" jinja2?? (asking @jdfreder )\n"
