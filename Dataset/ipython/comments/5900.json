What happens if there were missed messages?\n\nHi @jasongrout !  Very glad you came to check-in on this.  I was going to ping you for your feedback after making another review pass- I don't want to break any of your single cell server stuff and I value your feedback with the widget stuff because it has helped a lot so far!\n\nYeah, that's how it's intended to work.  Messages shouldn't be lost- I've added a closure that is created if the underlying socket hasn't been created yet.  If that's the case, the closure(s) get called when the sockets are reconnected.\n\nIf the kernel is new, i.e. a kernel restart, I don't attempt to create any widgets in the back-end.  So if you save your notebook with widgets, close ipython, start ipython, and open the same notebook, the widgets will display (with \"disabled\" = true) but any messages at that point will be discarded (an error will appear in the sys console saying that comm id blah blah doesn't exist).\n"

    "body": "Following the hangout of yesterday on this matter with @ellisonbg @minrk @takluyver @jdfreder and @jasongrout . \n\nOne of the reservations of @minrk against the persistence of model states in the notebook file format is that it seems to imply that we would need future versions of IPython's widgets to be compatible with these models.\n\nHowever, the \"nbconverted\" notebook embeds the optimized version of the JavaScript code, meaning that it will always be usable regardless of the changes in IPython's code. Readablility of the file only depends on the ability of future browsers to execute today's JavaScript.\n\nWe would only be sensible to changes in IPython code when loading a notebook ipynb file with a different version of ipython. \nIn that case, the simple addition of a model version number in widget would solve the issue. If the version numbers don't match, we should not try to re-instantiate models and views from those states. \n\nIn doing so, there would not be incremental backward incompatibility due to the persistence. (Backward incompatibility is already introduced when changing the Python API of widgets anyway.)\n"
