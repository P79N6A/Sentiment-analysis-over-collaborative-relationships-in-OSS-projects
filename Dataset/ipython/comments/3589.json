However if you don't want to be bothered paying effort, there's nbviewer and nbconvert html. Both use way less effort than required by preparing the presentation (no need to work with the cell metadata), and if you want just a refreshed look, then a custom css will work wonders in the latter case. Then you get something that you can just likewise show in the browser, and navigate via scrolling.\n\nThe \"rules\" which you want to change for the \"special case of IPython notebook\" aren't imposed by anyone, this is just what you need to do to make an OK presentation. If making an OK presentation is not the idea, I would like to know what is the actual intended use of the converter to reveal.js.\n\nGranted the above, I can absolutely see how one can make use of a quick-and-dirty presentation, where long outputs are used. What I tried to explain above was that even in that case scrolling is inferior to e.g. automatic scaling of the slides content, or scrolling long output just like done within ipython notebook itself.\n\nAs a final remark, I would like to also say that the current solution is in a way not Pythonic. We all enjoy Python for its emphasis on the ease of understanding the code. I think that the following statements from 'The Zen of Python' apply to our dispute:\n\n> Simple is better than complex.\n> Sparse is better than dense.\n> Readability counts.\n"

    "body": "> I agree with you (and the majority of IPython nbconvert reveal users) that one doesn't want to pay a lot of effort in modifying a notebook in order to make it suitable for a presentation. \n\nGreat!\n\n> However if you don't want to be bothered paying effort, there's nbviewer and nbconvert html.\n\nIf the payment is too much high, probably nobody will use this slideshow format, so I think we have to keep the payment as lower as we can... whereas we achieve all the \"necessary\" features of a good slideshow framework.\n\n> The \"rules\" which you want to change for the \"special case of IPython notebook\" aren't imposed by anyone, this is just what you need to do to make an OK presentation. If making an OK presentation is not the idea, I would like to know what is the actual intended use of the converter to reveal.js.\n\nI agree with you... we just think different about what is an OK presentation in the current stage (which is not the broad stage of a more general presentation framework).\n\n> Granted the above, I can absolutely see how one can make use of a quick-and-dirty presentation, where long outputs are used. What I tried to explain above was that even in that case scrolling is inferior to e.g. automatic scaling of the slides content, or scrolling long output just like done within ipython notebook itself.\n\nI don't think that scrolling is inferior to automatic scaling of the slides... but at the end is a subjective opinion...\nSuppose you have automatic scaled slides, probably you can reorder your content making this scaled slides as subslides... in a not automated way (I know)... but you achieve the same result... btw, the implementation of the automatic scaling would not be trivial... because if would be difficult to not cut the content in an inappropriate way... \nAbout the scrolling long outputs as the IPython notebook itself... it is an interesting point to further investigate ;-)\n\n> As a final remark, I would like to also say that the current solution is in a way not Pythonic. We all enjoy Python for its emphasis on the ease of understanding the code. I think that the following statements from 'The Zen of Python' apply to our dispute:\n\nI think that the automatic scaling is the not Pythonic way, nor simpler than scrolling... but again, it is a subjective matter ;-)\nI really appreciate your comments... and you have valid points here, just I think the scrolling is a better solution right now to solve the problem.\n"

    "body": "> we just think different about what is an OK presentation in the current stage \n> (which is not the broad stage of a more general presentation framework).\n\nThen please explain why the idea that the viewers should be able to easily follow the presentation content does not apply. Also I would like to know why `ipython nbconvert --to html` is not an OK presentation already.\n\n> I don't think that scrolling is inferior to automatic scaling of the slides... but at the end is a subjective opinion...\n\nNo it isn't a subjective opinion. We're discussing an implementation of a technology with a set aim (delivering information to large audience), and not whether it looks pretty. I explained above why scrolling is harder to follow by many people at once (breaks of content that don't match the logic, and impossibility to return to the previous part of the same logical segment (slide) once it was scrolled away). How is that a subjective opinion?\n\nBy the way, another complication that you are forgetting is that while presentations with scrolling are easier to generate, they mean that you cannot give the presentation using a remote, and you have to stick next to the laptop when giving the presentation (most remotes only have forward/backward button). Majority of the speakers that I encounter past the PhD level (which simply means that they are giving presentations more frequently) use the remote. So yeah, it takes little effort to make a presentation, but it takes appreciably more effort to deliver the talk.\n\n> I think that the automatic scaling is the not Pythonic way, nor simpler than scrolling... but again, it is a subjective matter ;-)\n\nWell, once again, we're not talking about what 'looks good', but rather about what is easier to read, so it's less so subjective. I still didn't hear your explanation how scrolled slides are easier to read than slides that are fully on a single screen. Of course (and I also stated it before), short and simple slides are even easier to read than ones with lengthy output.\n\n> and you have valid points here, just I think the scrolling is a better solution right now\n\nI already understood that that is your current opinion. What I do not understand is the reasoning behind it, so I would be grateful if you explain your motivation in more detail.\n\n# \n\nHowever our discussion is by now too abstract, so to be more specific I have modified the slides from the presentation I gave yesterday to actually overflow (I simply merged two consequtive slides), see http://antonakhmerov.org/scrolling_presentation.png\n\nOf course, I have organised my talk such that these were two slides. So first of all you see that in this case a scrollbar isn't even necessary, because there's an elephantine gap at the top of the slide, and two of its sisters at the sides. Second, this illustrated rather clearly that until I finish talking about the first image, which probably take me around 3-5 minutes, there will be an unknown broken bit of stuff at the bottom, which nobody can understand. Imagine that just removing the gap from the top wouldn't solve the problem, and the slide would still end in half an image. Do you still think that this is better than the case when all of the slide is scaled to 90%?\n"
