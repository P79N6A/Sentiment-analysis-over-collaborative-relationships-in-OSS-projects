    "body": "Notebook is on AWS c3.8xlarge\nI am connecting via https, using a profile I created, which is basically vanilla.\nI am using an AWS elastic IP, no load balancer or anything like that.\nMy browser is Safari (latest version)\n\nThere is no output, because I am using ipcluster, and ipcluster threads do not send output to the Client.  So it does just sit idle for that amount of time.  Every now and then I will click on a cell with \"1+1\" in it, just to send some sort of command to the server to try and help things along.\n\nI can attempt to produce with the while true.  I will try that.  My research is due in 24 hours so I will have to do it after that, but this is causing me great pains of course as per my deadline.\n\nAnything I can do to keep the connection alive between browser and server?  For example, in SSH I am familiar with keep alives, and those work great for that layer.  But I am unfamiliar on how I might do that between my browser and the notebook server.  \n\nThank you for responding\n\nBrian\n\nOn Dec 11, 2013, at 5:36 PM, Min RK notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> My guess that the connection is being dropped after being idle for too long.
