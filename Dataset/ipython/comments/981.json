    "body": "I've just tested it by making a toy git repo with a notebook and making changes to it, it's great!  The diffs are indeed much more readable, so I'm a big +1 on this one.\n\nOne last question: @ellisonbg and I were chatting yesterday, and wondering if the json text wouldn't be more readable if we decreased the indentation of the writer to two, or even just one space per level.  That way, the code blocks would be much closer to the left margin, reducing the need for scrolling.\n\nSince in this case the spaces are not semantically meaningful, I like the idea of trying out like that.  The [code is here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/nbformat/v2/nbjson.py#L50).  I tried it out locally and even indent of just 1 looks actually pretty good.  Because there's so much nesting in json, even just one space per level actually produces pretty readable json.\n\nGive it a try and see what you think; after trying 2 and 1, my vote is actually for 1 (I'm surprised, I would have intuitively thought that would be too tight, but I actually like how the notebooks read this way).\n\nI'd like to merge this one with all these changes included, so we can tell people who update to expect just one round of changes to the on-disk format of their notebooks.\n\nFor reference, here's the dump of a toy notebook with indent=1:\n\n```\n{\n \"metadata\": {\n  \"name\": \"nb\"\n }, \n \"nbformat\": 2, \n \"worksheets\": [\n  {\n   \"cells\": [\n    {\n     \"cell_type\": \"markdown\", \n     \"source\": [\n      \"# new title\", \n      \"\", \n      \"some text that changes\", \n      \"\", \n      \"* one is the first\", \n      \"* two\", \n      \"* three\", \n      \"\", \n      \"and more!\"\n     ]\n    }, \n    {\n     \"cell_type\": \"code\", \n     \"collapsed\": false, \n     \"input\": [\n      \"if 2:\", \n      \"    print 'hi ho'\", \n      \"    \", \n      \"def ff(x):\", \n      \"    \\\"\\\"\\\"func\\\"\\\"\\\"\", \n      \"    return x**3\", \n      \"\", \n      \"ff(10)\"\n     ], \n     \"language\": \"python\", \n     \"outputs\": [\n      {\n       \"output_type\": \"stream\", \n       \"stream\": \"stdout\", \n       \"text\": [\n        \"hi ho\"\n       ]\n      }, \n      {\n       \"output_type\": \"pyout\", \n       \"prompt_number\": 3, \n       \"text\": [\n        \"1000\"\n       ]\n      }\n     ], \n     \"prompt_number\": 3\n    }, \n    {\n     \"cell_type\": \"code\", \n     \"collapsed\": true, \n     \"input\": [], \n     \"language\": \"python\", \n     \"outputs\": []\n    }\n   ]\n  }\n ]\n}\n```\n"
