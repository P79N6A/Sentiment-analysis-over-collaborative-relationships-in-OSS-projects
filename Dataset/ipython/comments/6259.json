You can still go to file menu and explicitly trust the notebook if you like. If you don't explicitely trust a notebook, then you have to rerun each codecell at least once for the notebook to get trusted by you.\n\nDoes that makes sens ?  \n"

    "body": "> So my own notebooks get automatically trusted by me?\n\nYes, on a per-machine basis, once you have executed once all cell. each cell get a \"trusted\" metadata, iff all cell are trusted, the notebook is cryptographically signed by  key we generate and put in your `.ipython/profile_xxx/security/notebook_secret`.\nYou can share the private keys between machines if you like. The procedure is reversed on load, and if the notebook is trusted, the HTML is not sanitized in output.\n\nIt should be extendable to trust circle via extensions in case of need, but no-one did it. It also guaranties that the notebook has not been modified. (I should write a blog post about that at some point). Note that this should already be included in 2.x. \n\nwhen migrating to you use the comandline tool `$ipython trust` to mass-sign notebooks.\n\n> When will IPython 3 be released? I am interested in that since this release will also include better multi lang kernel support I assume.\n\nFallish-winterish. My Personal point of view is that most of the big feature have landed. \nIf you drop something like [that](https://github.com/takluyver/bash_kernel/blob/master/kernelspec/kernel.json) in `.ipython/kernelspec/iruby` on master, you should get something along the following screenshot if you are using master. (docs [here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPEP-25:-Registry-of-installed-kernels))\n![capture decran 2014-07-22 a 16 53 51](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/335567/3796980/283bf0a0-1bd2-11e4-8276-54b3c02eb503.png)\n\nWe are still ironing out the custom.js, logo, favicon and css part.\n\nThe exact date depend if we do a \"small\" new feature release, or push toward the big multiuser server first.\n"
