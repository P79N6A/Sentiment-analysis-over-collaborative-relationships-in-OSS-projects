But in the end I think the git versioning approach you took is a bit more complex than we want to have in core code, so let's do without. It also produces awful version names in the console, which we're just not going to have:\n\nIPython 0.11.alpha1.git.4fb9824c78bd82f839a1f741397e23c5aa3e1995.tomspur-ready_for_merge -- An enhanced Interactive Python.\n\nDitto for changes to make_tarball, which I've already updated elsewhere in trunk (so in fact now this branch produces a conflict).\n\nI think the best approach will be to close this pull request and you can make a new branch where you cherrypick the unbundling changes, but do _not_ bring in any changes to anything else.  That way we can test/evaluate unbundling of externals on its own merit.\n\nBasically the mantra is: one pull request for one single idea, no more :)\n\nSo I'm going to close this one for now.  Just make a new branch with only the unbundling commits and it should be pretty smooth.\n\nThanks!\n"
