    "body": "OK for waiting post sqlite history merger.  I just wanted to thank you for tackling these unicode issues! \n\nOne thing to note: we may need to make history loading more robust against encoding issues.  Just in testing this I input some unicode, then went back to running on master, but since the unicode had gone into my history file on disk, now I can't start ipython because it crashes on initialization:\n\n<pre>\namirbar[~]> ip\nError in sys.excepthook:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/crashhandler.py\", line 137, in __call__\n    traceback = TBhandler.text(etype,evalue,etb,context=31)\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/ultratb.py\", line 397, in text\n    tb_offset, context)\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/ultratb.py\", line 958, in structured_traceback\n    ipinst = ipapi.get()\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/ipapi.py\", line 29, in get\n    return InteractiveShell.instance()\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py\", line 315, in instance\n    inst = cls(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py\", line 279, in __init__\n    self.init_readline()\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py\", line 1565, in init_readline\n    self.reload_history() \n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py\", line 1259, in reload_history\n    self.history_manager.reload_history()\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/history.py\", line 174, in reload_history\n    self.populate_readline_history()\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/history.py\", line 146, in populate_readline_history\n    self.shell.readline.add_history(line)\nUnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\\xe1' in position 6: ordinal not in range(128)\n\nOriginal exception was:\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/bin/ipython\", line 10, in <module>\n    launch_new_instance()\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/frontend/terminal/ipapp.py\", line 660, in launch_new_instance\n    app.start()\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/application.py\", line 210, in start\n    self.initialize()\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/application.py\", line 202, in initialize\n    self.construct()\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/frontend/terminal/ipapp.py\", line 478, in construct\n    self.shell = TerminalInteractiveShell.instance(config=self.master_config)\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py\", line 315, in instance\n    inst = cls(*args, **kwargs)\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/frontend/terminal/interactiveshell.py\", line 87, in __init__\n    user_global_ns=user_global_ns, custom_exceptions=custom_exceptions\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py\", line 279, in __init__\n    self.init_readline()\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py\", line 1565, in init_readline\n    self.reload_history() \n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py\", line 1259, in reload_history\n    self.history_manager.reload_history()\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/history.py\", line 174, in reload_history\n    self.populate_readline_history()\n  File \"/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/core/history.py\", line 146, in populate_readline_history\n    self.shell.readline.add_history(line)\nUnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\\xe1' in position 6: ordinal not in range(128)\n</pre>\n\n\nNow, in this case I know perfectly what's going on (the product of going back and forth between branches with different unicode behavior) and I also know how to get out of it.  But a normal user may get seriously frustrated by a failure of this kind.\n\nSo in the history branch, we probably want to make sure that in the face of catastrophic errors with history loading, we simply clean things up, start a new history store (db in the new code) and get up and running (informing the user of what happened) rather than blocking out startup.\n\nThis is just a comment to keep in mind as we rework the history stuff...  As far as _this_ branch is concerned, all I can say is _thank you_ for tackling this unicode mess.  In my mind, this was one of the major, if not the key, blocker for getting 0.11 out the door.\n\nAwesome work, as always.\n"
