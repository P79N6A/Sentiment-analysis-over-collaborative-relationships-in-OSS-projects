    "body": "It is working, but it literally expands the Python variable into the shell command, with no escaping, so when it hits a `\"` inside there, it will close the string you opened for bash.\n\nThe `!` system command syntax is a shorthand, and can't do everything you can do by running a subprocess. E.g. without any escaping at all, you could run `echo` directly:\n\n``` python\nimport subprocess\nsubprocess.call(['echo', '-e', content])\n```\n\nOr you could use an environment variable:\n\n``` python\nimport os\nos.environ['FOOBAR'] = content\n!echo -e $FOOBAR\n```\n"
