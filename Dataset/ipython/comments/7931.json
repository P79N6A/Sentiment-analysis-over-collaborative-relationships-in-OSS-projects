    "body": "This is something I tried to tackle in ipython/ipython#7008 but which is still work in progress. \nOne of the issues is that the alternative themes quickly get out of sync if nobody uses them. \nSo unless someone want to fiddle with css/less to maintain the themes, there are few chances of having themes out of the box. \n\nNote that with previous linked PR, it would be only a matter of defining values of color/variable, not technically fiddling with css. \n\nThe JS dropdown is almost trivial and was one of the first [extension](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions/tree/master/styling/css_selector) I [wrote](http://carreau.github.io/posts/02-css-selector.html), but is useless without an actual maintained theme. \n"

I suppose ~80-90% of changes people want in themes are values of [variable](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/html/static/notebook/less/variables.less). So should almost never break. \n\nThe rest will mostly be sending changes to main css to make theming easier. \n\nSo if I had to put number, I would say a couple of days to make a good automatic css build tool (you have a starting point above), then probably a couple of hours per week, if you are living on master. \n"

Thanks for the answer!\n\nApart from the CSS rebuilder (I'm reading the [other thread](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/7008)), I wonder if we had a button like \"Import theme\", maybe this would at least make it easier for people to use custom \"themes\" (like packages with css/less/etc). I know today it's a matter of copying this to the right profile folder, but this could actually encourage people to create and share their own themes, couldn't it? And, then, instead of maintaining 4 themes like in your extension, we could try to maintain only a light and a dark theme (changing only colors).\n\nDoes that make any sense? I know this is not a priority tho.\n"
