The CompositeError object raised at the Client level represents a collection of errors, but there need not be more than one.  Take this example which will only fail on engine 0:\n\n``` python\nIn [2]: dv = rc[:]\nIn [3]: dv.scatter('id', rc.ids, flatten=True)\nIn [4]: dv.execute(\"a = 1.0 / id\", block=True)\nCompositeError: one or more exceptions from call to method: execute\n[0:execute]: ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero\n\nIn [5]: dv['a']\nCompositeError: one or more exceptions from call to method: _pull\n[0:apply]: NameError: name 'a' is not defined\n\nIn [6]: rc[1:]['a']\nOut[6]: [1.0, 0.5, 0.3333333333333333]\n```\n"
