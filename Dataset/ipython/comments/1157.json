If I reverse them, the behavior seems a good deal more sensible:\n* ctrl-C during prompt is ignored (not great, but not horrible)\n* ctrl-C during execution behaves normally\n</del>\n\n\nPR #1160 simply restores the SIGINT handler outside of the inputhook.\n"

Though I've been known to do things exactly like this with varying degrees of success (and ruination).\n\nPart of the cost of EPD (or any package-management system for that matter) is added difficulty for using your own versions of things, and 'official' binary installers (other than Python eggs) are rarely compatible.\n\nI'm not sure it's worth trying to get newer PySide running with EPD, but rather bug EPD folks about getting a reasonably current PySide into EPD officially.  It's a pretty big deal, especially on OSX where numerous critical bugs have been fixed since 1.0.5.\n"
