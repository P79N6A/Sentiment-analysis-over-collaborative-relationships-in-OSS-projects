    "body": "The problem, of course, is that it is difficult to know where the future\nmatters, and trouble would only crop up in situations where a developer\nadded a new import statement expecting to get a global module and instead\ngot a local module -- e.g, a `import io` from any file in `IPython/utils`.\n\nI think we should seriously consider a default set of `__future__` import\nstatements in all modules, regardless of use, as a way of enforcing coding\nstyle best practices and future compatibility.\n\nNonetheless, I'm happy to remove the \"noise\" for now.\n"

When IPython starts to consider itself 'a Python 3 project that supports Python 2', then these large, sweeping changes that make it more unpleasant to work with Python 2 are totally appropriate.\n"
