E.g. how to configure a project to depend on ipython 6 for supported python versions, but version 5 otherwise.\r\n\r\nWe can definitely look at the docs and README to further highlight Python 2 support and IPython 5 LTS.\r\n\r\n> A blog post about 6.0.0rc1 and its impact would be most welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestion. We typically do blog posts for major releases and mailing list posts for release candidates.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

I assumed, based on how Debian/Ubuntu package management works, that this would be a basic piece of data to require from packages in a standard way, so that tools like pypi-data could show the full dependency tree. Though I dare say it's complicated.... \r\n\r\n I did find some advice on [How to extract dependencies from a PyPi package](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14154756/how-to-extract-dependencies-from-a-pypi-package), but it's not that easy."

So you can't have a static list of all a packages dependencies in general.\r\n\r\nThere are better ways to handle conditional dependencies now - you can make a static list with 'environment markers' to filter which ones are used. If packages provide the information, PyPI can record dependencies (e.g. [astsearch](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/astsearch) shows the dependency on astcheck). But many packages don't."
