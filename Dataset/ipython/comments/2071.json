Might be good to write this down in the 'releasing ipython'\nsection of the docs.  Just dump a section on Windows releasing with\nwhatever you think is important to remember that is not done by your\nscript, while it's fresh in your mind.  Will make the next release\neasier.\n\nThanks again for the great windows work, we're in much better release\nshape on windows now.\n"
