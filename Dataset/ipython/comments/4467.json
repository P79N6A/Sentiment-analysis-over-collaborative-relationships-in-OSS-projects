What we need to do is to allows notebooks to be selected with a checkbox and then have buttons/dropdown actions at the top of the list - similar to how gmail allows actions on emails. I am -1 on adding this capability without fixing the UI - which is a larger project we need to do.\n"

    "body": "There are a couple of issues with the current design (I take all the\nblame!) and its extensions to multiple buttons or even per-notebook\ndropdown menu:\n- It is bad visual design to have elements that are repeated needlessly. It\n  makes the design much more busy, distracts and confuses the user visually.\n  Simple is almost always better visually. Putting a dropdown menu for each\n  notebook with different actions is better than a bunch of separate buttons,\n  but you still have the repeated dropdown menus. The only way I would even\n  consider a per-notebook dropdown is that if it only shows on hover.\n- Having buttons/UI for each Notebook that are right justified in the list\n  item makes for a difficult user experience when the window is wide. More\n  than once, I have clicked on the \"Delete\" button for the wrong notebook.\n- Multiple selection actions are an important abstraction that I think we\n  do need to support in the notebook list. If we want to support this, it\n  would be confusing to also support Notebook specific buttons/dropdowns.\n- It is easy to build nice keyboard bindings for a checkbox driven UI like\n  gmail. More difficult for per-item buttons.\n- Over time we will add more and more actions, making the per-notebook UI\n  even more difficult to scale.\n\nCheers, Brian\n\nOn Mon, Nov 4, 2013 at 11:38 PM, Matthias Bussonnier <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> I tend to agree with @Zsailer https://github.com/Zsailer, I was\n> pissed-off when google removed the common action on every mail.\n> I understand that some action are good on multiple selections, but some\n> are inherently 1-notebook action.\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/4467#issuecomment-27752444\n> .\n\n## \n\nBrian E.

You may not notice it with one or two buttons\nbut when you add more actions (like Download, Rename, Open... just to mention some) it might result very difficult to use.\n\nThe other thing that might be an issue is that some actions make much more sense on one notebook than on a group of notebooks, like Rename. But that is the only one I can think of and is not even available on the dashboard right now.\nIt might be an option to have the checkbox driven UI for actions that apply to one or a group of notebooks (Delete, Download, Shutdown, Copy, Move) and a \"show on hover\" for things like Rename.\nDoes that sound confusing?\n"
