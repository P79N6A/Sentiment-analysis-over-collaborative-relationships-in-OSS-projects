The \"does not run code\" after saving is normal, as with edit, the code is run when the editor program does exit and allow the python process to continue running. which with gui editor (macvim, or notepad) is not possible because of event loop. You can sometime go around that by passing some flag to your editor. (like -w for text mate).\n"
