    "body": "Hi @botuvenkatesh , we were chatting in the IPython Help HipChat room, and I forgot to ask which version of IPython you were using. I (wrongly) assumed that you were testing [IPython 1.0.0rc1](http://archive.ipython.org/testing/1.0.0/).\n\nThe issue you saw was originally reported as #2390 and has been fixed for 1.0. You can either grab the release candidate now, or wait about a week until we do the final 1.0.0 release, and update to the stable version then.\n\nI am closing this issue as it is a duplicate of #2390 and fixed in master. Feel free to re-open if this is not the case for you.\n"
