But if we go this route, we might want to check for purely positive non null integers. \n"

    "body": "Ah apologies for the PR confusion. I've updated this PR to include your suggested changes. I included the removal of `breaklist = self.get_file_breaks(filename)` as I removed a few miscellaneous print statements as well.\n\nI'd be happy to change it back to `if not context`, as it is cleaner (though that doesn't account for weird inputs like negative ints). \n\nI noticed that the debugger doesn't raise any exceptions, but rather prints them to stdout. However, when following this format, the error message is printed at the top of the stack trace, making it difficult to find, unless we `break` after printing. Let me know what works best.\n"
