    "body": "The idea of doing a friendly fork and trying to get permission to upload new releases as 'pygments' has occurred to me. But I'm not eager to be maintaining yet another package, and most of the pull requests open are tweaks to the lexers for a wide variety of languages, which I imagine are hard for one person to review. Splitting them out as separate pieces would make some things easier, but then it needs integration work; those included batteries are nice from a user perspective.\r\n\r\nMaybe we could identify a collection of key fixes (like this one) and try to encourage a one-time new release? Feels a bit rude to be pleading that *my bug's important*, though.\r\n\r\nOr maybe identify other projects using pygments and try to assemble a maintenance team? I believe there are quite a few projects that depend on it."
