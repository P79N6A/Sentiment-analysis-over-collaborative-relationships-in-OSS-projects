    "body": "Thank you for your report. I'm not seeing this in notebook version 4.2.2 and ipykernel 4.3.1, so presumably this is something that was fixed between the original report and now (likely via https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/pull/34) so I am closing this issue . As Matthias pointed out, [ipython/ipykernel](/ipython/ipykernel) would be the appropriate place to report this bug if it does recur.\n\nHappy hacking! :bowtie:\n"
