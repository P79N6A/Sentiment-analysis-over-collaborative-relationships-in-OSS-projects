    "body": "Remember that the Qt console is not in the same process as the kernel. It simply submits a completion request to the kernel:\n\nhttps://github.com/epatters/ipython/blob/master/IPython/frontend/qt/console/ipython_widget.py#L263\n\nThe request contains the current \"word\", the current line, the position of the cursor in that line, and the full input buffer. This results in `complete` being called on the kernel side:\n\nhttps://github.com/epatters/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py#L1775\n\nSo that's where you need to plug in. Hopefully a developer with more knowledge of the kernel-side completion mechanism can chime with some specifics.\n"

Because we\ndo _not_ want to make greedy completion the default ever, as it can\nhave nasty side effects.  I'm all for making greedy completion\navailable, but it must never be the default.  Early on in ipython I\nmade it work that way, and was forced to back out because eventually\npeople turned up with objects where such aggressive introspection\ncaused problematic side effects.  Therefore it must be something that\nusers enable themselves, and never the default.\n"
