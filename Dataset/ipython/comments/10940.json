    "body": "So as expected, this is causing a failure on Travis, because we haven't yet eliminated all warnings. We'll need to finish clearing them up before this can be merged.\r\n\r\nIf possible, I'd also like to use this behaviour only when building the docs on Travis, not every time we build the docs locally. We can already see warnings, and I think it's still useful to be able to build the docs when there are warnings."

    "body": "If understand the code correctly, docstrings are being imported from the official pdb and applied to the internal implementation of the Pdb class. One of these is the malformed docstring that is causing the warning. However, [looking at the source code](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/ede157331b4f9e550334900b3b4de1c8590688de/Lib/pdb.py#L1106-L1109) for the actual docstring, I don't see any issues, so I'm not entirely sure what the issue is. It's possible that there is an issue with the `decorate_fn_with_doc` function. I'll keep digging.\r\n\r\nI am having issues building the docs locally, so I'm going to add [WIP] to the PR title while I test things. Please ignore commits to this PR until I have removed the [WIP] tag from the title."
