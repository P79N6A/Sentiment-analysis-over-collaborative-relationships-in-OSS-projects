Further, the notebook document in 2.0 will almost certainly support _arbitrary_ mime-types, so any mime-type will be valid.  That doesn't mean the live notebook will support everything - most things will just pass through unmodified to the document without being drawn.  The only impediment to this is the fact that we transform `image/png` to `png`, which we will stop doing in 2.0.\n\nIt was a mistake to not support PDF all along, because it really is the right way to do figures for latex export,\neven though they aren't drawn in the live notebook.  If you want to write a notebook with the intention of PDF export, you should probably:\n1. enable PDF formatter for figures _in addition to_ live format (png, etc.)\n2. in nbconvert, ignore all output other than PDF when PDF is present\n\nThis will substantially increase the size of the notebook, but it will dramatically improve the quality of output,\nsince matplotlib writes much better PDFs than doing MPL SVG -> inkscape -> PDF, which is the current path.\n"
