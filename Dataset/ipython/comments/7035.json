    "body": "> I'm not sure what's better about it - using map with '*' as the only value seems to be equivalent to putting it in paths, from my reading of the docs.\n\nThe difference is that in `map` requirejs will interprete the `nbextension` as set in `path` so I can in google drive content manager.js use relative path in require. Otherwise this mean that the js files in google drive have to be templates to know where they are installed.\nWithout this I have to require everywhere `nbextension/<path-under-which-this-is-install>/filename` which is annoying.\n"
