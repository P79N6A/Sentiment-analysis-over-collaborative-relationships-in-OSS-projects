    "body": "+1 for link: the symmetry argument is a good one, and from reading the code, I actually think it expresses the behavior best of all the proposed names. Bind is often used either in connect/bind asymmetric situations, or as in bindings (language wrappers). From reading what the code actually does, I find link to be a very natural description.\n\nFor example, many UIs for image processing that want to link two attributes to change in sync (such as resizing an image when you want to preserve its aspect ratio), use a little chain link icon to illustrate that:\n\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/57394/2092287/cb578c24-8ea9-11e3-8254-7cb2b9669dce.png)\n\nThat makes me really like 'link' for this. If @jasongrout is willing to do the PR work, that would be great.\n"
