    "body": "> @minrk but aren't notebook IDs transient and reset each time the notebook server restarts?\n\nYes, though I believe that is only temporary until we redo the persistent URL scheme more carefully.\n\n> Won't that mean that the URLs have to be updated each time the notebook server is started?\n\nYes, if you use absolute URLs.  That's why I adjusted the url scheme (unchanged other than the notebook url ends with '/') so that relative URLs can be used.  The url `files/foo` will always work, no matter what you change about the notebook name, location, server session, etc.  It will still work if you send it to another machine, etc.\n\n> Unless I am missing something I think for the single user notebook, we should not use per-notebook URLs for this reason. In my mind the server directory in single user mode is like a \"project directory\" and that should be used for serving all file for all notebooks at that location.\n\nYou are right, per-project does make more sense.  I think what that means is I should revert my adjustment to the url scheme.  Do we know what the url-scheme will look like in a multi-project environment?  It seems like the project name must simply be prepended to our existing urls, so they become `/<project>/notebook`, in which case it should be `/<project>/files`.  Is this correct?\n\n> Another question - is there checks to make sure a user doesn't break out of the directory using ../../..? That would be a serious security risk.\n\nI am just using the tornado StaticFileHandler, modified only to add authentication, so unless our current '/static' url grants access outside itself (which would be astonishing), it cannot, but I will check to be sure.\n"
