    "body": "The kernel shutdown message/behavior is already open as issue #1587, and the persistent URLs is also something we intend to do, as has been [discussed](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/977#issuecomment-2705179) in #977.\n\nI am a bit confused about your experience, because the notebook URLs are persistent for the whole lifetime of the notebook server.  Can you describe your steps to entering this can't-save state?  I cannot reproduce it by opening several windows on the same notebook, and killing it, restarting it, or leaving it dead.  Every situation I try, I can still edit and save without issue.\n\n> Worse, there is no way to save the file now, as the \"save\" capability asks the kernel for the .ipynb file.\n\nThis is not accurate - the kernel is not involved in saving in any way.\n"

    "body": "Thanks for the info.\n\nI'm confused by it too, but I just hit it again without restarting the kernel, so I'll keep poking at it until I can reproduce it.  Fortunately i was trying to fix some of IPython's CSS so didn't have any important work in the notebook...  ;)\n\nRegarding inability to save, the File->\"Download As\" and File->\"Make a copy...\" menu items both send a request to the server, and do not function if the kernel is disconnected (or the kernel has been restarted, or otherwise doesn't recognize the file's hash).  So I don't understand your comment.  The only way to save is to request that the kernel write the file, as far as I can see.\n\nIf it's possible to save (download) a .ipynb file directly from the browser without contacting the kernel, that would be fantastic!  I suspect cross-site restrictions will prevent it...\n"

Kernels can segfault all over the place with no effect on saving.\n\nThe notebook hash should _never_ change for the lifetime of the notebook server.\n"
