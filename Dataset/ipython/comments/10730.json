    "body": "I don't think we should do this. When looking at a dictionary interactively, it's extremely useful for the keys to be sorted so that the same dictionary always looks the same (different key order is *not* a different dictionary).\r\n\r\nI don't think displaying the dictionary is the right way to indicate that key order can change in certain Python implementations (why would you assume that the repr takes the key order into account rather than sorting)? I think if you want to illustrate key order, explicitly iterating through the dict keys is a better way to illustrate this idea."
