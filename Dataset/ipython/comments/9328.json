    "body": "If you know you want the `Linux` colours, the easiest thing may be to pass that explicitly, rather than instantiating an InteractiveShell to get it.\n\nThe idea is that `InteractiveShell` is the common execution machinery shared by terminal IPython and IPython running as a kernel for the notebook/qtconsole/other frontends. `TerminalInteractiveShell` is the subclass of that used in terminal IPython (and `ZMQInteractiveShell`, now in ipykernel, is the subclass for the kernel). I did some refactoring to move the readline initialisation code from IS to TIS. This is the first step in a much larger refactoring I'm working on for IPython 5 - I can't yet say what approach will be equivalent in the future.\n"

Would this be a more robust way to get the IPython colors from the config?\n\n``` python\nfrom IPython.terminal.ipapp import TerminalIPythonApp\ncolors = TerminalIPythonApp.instance().shell.colors\n```\n\nBetter suggestions welcome, obviously !\n"
