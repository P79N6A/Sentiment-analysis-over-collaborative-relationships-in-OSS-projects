    "body": "After the order of the css statement, the rule that apply is that the most specific css rule wins. \n\nin particular the default css as a rule:\n\n```\n .rendered_html td, .rendered_html th {\ntext-align: left;\nvertical-align: middle;\npadding: 4px;\n}\n```\n\nwhich target `td`s which themselves are inside `tr`s. hence your inline rule is `tr *` which is less specific than `td`s, and get dropped. You can test by adding the following to your jsfiddle:\n\n```\ntable td {\n    text-align : left;\n}\n```\n\nClosing as not something we can fix. You can try to set the attribute on each TD.\n"
