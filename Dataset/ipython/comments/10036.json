    "body": "This does work for me most of the time in IPython. But I would guess that something in the code is using a random number before you call `random.random()`.\n\nIf you want to have your own sequence of random numbers independent of any other code using them, create a new random.Random instance as the [docs mention](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#notes-on-reproducibility):\n\n> The functions supplied by this module are actually bound methods of a hidden instance of the random.Random class. You can instantiate your own instances of Random to get generators that don’t share state.\n\n```\n 23│ myrand = random.Random(100)\n\n 24│ myrand.random()\n 24> 0.1456692551041303\n```\n"
