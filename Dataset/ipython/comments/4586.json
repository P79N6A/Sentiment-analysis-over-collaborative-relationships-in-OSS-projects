    "body": "It's a difference between pandoc markdown and normal markdown rendering (the live notebook).\n\nIn general in markdown, when you have:\n\n```\n<number>. item\n```\n\nit created a numbered list, starting at 1. The values of the numbers don't actually have any effect.\nWhen I type the following markdown in this GitHub comment:\n\n``` markdown\n2. this\n2. is\n2. a\n2. list\n```\n\nit renders as:\n1. this\n2. is\n3. a\n4. list\n\nI guess pandoc does some sniffing of the first number to set the start count (the html generated is `<ol start=\"2\"...>`, but this is not standard markdown behavior.\n"
