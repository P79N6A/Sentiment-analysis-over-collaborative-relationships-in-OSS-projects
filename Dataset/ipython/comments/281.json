The saved file is created but with 0 size.\n\nThe session only had this in two cells:\n\n<pre>\n#1\nplot(rand(100))\n\n#2\nfor i in range(10):\n    print i,\n</pre>\n\n\nand I requested inline png images.  The session had been started with '--pylab inline'.  I'm running pyside from trunk, with the most recent commit I have being:\n\n<pre>\ncommit c3d180fdc269183cb4f46ee773bb8521f283bff0\nAuthor: Renato Araujo Oliveira Filho <renato.filho@openbossa.org>\nDate:   Thu Feb 10 14:01:59 2011 -0300\n\n    Created unit test for bug #671.\n</pre>\n\n\nI'm leaving now for the SIAM conference, so I will likely not be able to do much testing until next weekend, unfortunately, but I'll try.\n"
