So if you do a split, and then change your mind, you can actually undo back within both cells and one of them will return to the unified pre-split stage, and the other will return to empty state. \n\n`%load` and `%loadpy` magics also ends up using `set_text` - and since those create new cells, and all new cells created within a session have `Ø` at the root of their history, _not_ resetting the history keeps things consistent. \n\nI can also imagine downstream widgets using this function, the effects of which would then be `undo`-able\n"
