    "body": "Hi, Anthony\n\nOK, first of all, I found a little bug... a missing slash in the CDN for the print-pdf stylesheet. I opened a PR to fix it: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/3635\n\nBut this is not the main problem, just a typo when I added the possibility to change the url to find the reveal.js library... The main two problem are two:\n1. @media print in style.min.css overwrite with black all the text. I opened an issue some month ago https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/3012 but we had to wait for bootstrap v3 to fix it (@Carreau, are we already using v3 in master??). I have modified this in the makefile of your repository until we implement the proper solution: https://github.com/scopatz/mc2013/pull/1/files#L0R8\n2. Now, if you add a custom.css file in your slideshow directory, the reveal.html file is able to read it... so you can customize the css. I use this approach and I added to your repository a custom.css containing css to override the overflow property in the slideshow: https://github.com/scopatz/mc2013/pull/1/files#L1R1\n\nWith this fixes, you now can print your slideshow using FIrefox, I had some problem with Chromium...\nThe resulting pdf is here: http://www.slideviper.oquanta.info/scopatz_mc13.reveal.pdf\n\nProbably is not the better solution, but it works ;-) \nTo improve the quality of the pdf, I have to fix and customize the print.css stylesheet or make our own stylesheet and serve it through a CDN... I will see ;-)\nI will probably write a blog post explaning this steps to make a pdf from the reveal slideshow.\n\nCheers and thanks for reporting...\n\nDamián.\n"

I have modified this in the makefile of your repository until we implement the proper solution: https://github.com/scopatz/mc2013/pull/1/files#L0R8\n\nWow! Thanks a ton.\n\nUnfortunately, I am not really able to regenerate the pdf that you see.  Even with firefox, I was still only able to get the first slide: http://scopatz.s3.amazonaws.com/mozilla_localhost_8000_scopatz_mc13.reveal.pdf\n\nHowever, by playing around with the print options (\"Print Background Color\" and \"Print Background Images\") I was able to get the back ground color visible.  (Also, what system are you on? I am on Ubuntu and half the time its native print manager pops up.  I hope this isn't platform-dependent too...)\n\nThanks for trying. A blog post would be super helpful. Any other advice?  \n"
