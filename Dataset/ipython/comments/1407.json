All I can suggest is that we ask our OSX crew if they've seen the problem as well... @ellisonbg, @minrk, @epatters, can you reproduce this problem by pasting the code @pshchelo posted above?\n\nAnd @pshchelo, in the meantime you can disable tooltips by starting your qtconsole with:\n\n```\n--IPythonWidget.enable_calltips=False\n```\n\nor you can put that permanently in your config file if you want.  At least it will let you get work done without blowing up in your face, until we can track down this problem.\n"

In the end I installed Qt 4.7.4 and PySide 1.1 for this Qt version from Nokia binary packages and compiled the PyQt 4.9.1 mac-sources against my installed Qt 4.7.4. Now everything works. I use both PySide and PyQt since I learn Qt+Python and want to do it on PySide, but Spyder IDE I use has some annoying troubles with PySide. For IPython/pylab only one of them is enough.\n"
