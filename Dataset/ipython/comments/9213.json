That minimal namespacing helped quickly distinguish the two.\n\nHonestly, now that we have years of data it seems that we're not really using anything but `rel` in practice, and since we could still encode `dev` into the `x.y.z...` format following [semver conventions](http://semver.org/), it probably makes more sense to drop the `rel-, foo-` approach and fall back to pure numbers + semver metadata if/when needed.\n"

    "body": "> Can this issue be closed, and if so, is a 4.2 release imminent?\n\nYes we can close. Though unfortunately we don't use milestone for minor revision this way, we mostly use minor milestone to automatically backport PRs. So minor milestone are almost always complete and do not reflect the proximity to a release. \n\nIn the other hand we have not released a new version of IPython in a while, so I don't see any reasons not to. \n"
