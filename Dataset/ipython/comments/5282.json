    "body": "I think the problem is that if the widget's `comm` attribute is never accessed, then its `_comm` is never set. @minrk suggested that `Widget.closed` should start as True, and be set to False when the comm is created. I think we don't actually need the `closed` attribute at all, and we can just check `self._comm is None` where we currently use it.\n\nDoes that make sense? Do we want closed to remain as a public API, in which case I'll turn it into a property? Or shall I just get rid of it entirely?\n"
