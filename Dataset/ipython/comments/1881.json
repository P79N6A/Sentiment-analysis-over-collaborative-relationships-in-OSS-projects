    "body": "I just want to record here what I said on the list about this topic, I hadn't seen the PR...\n\nOn Thu, Jun 7, 2012 at 2:50 PM, Bob McElrath <bob+ipython@mcelrath.org> wrote:\n\n> It turns out to get decent quality SVG figures, you have to set the\n> figure.figsize fairly high.\n\nUnfortunately it's much more complicated than that.  I experimented a\nLOT when I first wrote the inline backend, hoping to make SVG the\ndefault. And unfortunately, while most simple plots do indeed look\nmuch nicer as SVG, in production work I kept running into corner cases\nwhere the SVG generated by MPL was just not quite right (missing\nelements, clipping lines wrong, poor transparency handling, etc.).  Of\ncourse, if I was a good citizen I'd have taken the time to record\nthose as test cases so we could fix them in MPL, but I just didn't\nhave the bandwidth to to both ipython and mpl work (this is when we\nwere just building the kernel system and the qtconsole, so our task\nlist was monstrous).\n\nI would _love_ to be able to switch to SVG by default, but until we\ncan trust that the SVG that comes out of MPL is consistently as solid\nas the pngs, or have the time to spend fixing those issues, I think\nit's best to keep the png defaults.\n\nThe problem with fixing this is that I've never been able to see the\nissues in easy to reproduce examples.  They tend to only happen with\nvery complex figures that I only can generate pulling full-blown\nresearch datasets out, so they make for poor test cases.\n\nI'll make it a priority from now on to try to at least record these\ncases in an isolated place, so that hopefully we can dig into them in\nMPL.  Because I know it's terrible behavior to put down mpl's\nrendering without providing a test case we can use to improve the\nsituation.\n"

    "body": "I switched the backend to Cairo, but unfortunately the Cairo backend has some kind of font problem.  Strings (axis labels, title) sometimes come out as though a cat walked across the keyboard, instead of the intended string.\n\nTo switch to the Cairo backend: change line 13 of `IPython/zmq/pylab/backend_inline.py` from\n\n```\nfrom matplotlib.backends.backend_svg import new_figure_manager\n```\n\nto:\n\n```\nfrom matplotlib.backends.backend_cairo import new_figure_manager\n```\n\n(That's all it takes, it seems).  None of the other backends will generate svg.\n\nTo demonstrate the Cairo font problem, it seems to occur always with the second figure, so enter this in a cell:\n\n```\n%pylab inline\nplot(rand(100), label=\"Test 1\")\nplt.title(\"this is a title\")\nplt.legend()\nfig = plt.figure()\nplt.title(\"This is a second title\")\nplot(rand(100), label=\"Test 2\")\nplt.legend()\n```\n\nIt was mentioned somewhere that the svg backend has some bugs as well.  I've seen this too, for me I often get histograms where the bars extend below the horizontal axis.  I don't have a reliable recipe to reproduce it, but maybe that suggestion will be useful to someone.\n"
