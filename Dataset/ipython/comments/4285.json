This took a while, since the combination of JavaScript, JQuery, CasperJS and phantomJS is a bit tricky to figure out who should be doing what... The uncaught exception stuff that @pablooliveira and I were seeing earlier are also gone now, and notebook kernels shutdown properly at the end of the tests.\n"
