    "body": "You should be able to do it by `css` can't give you the exact shenigan from the top of my head. \nprobably using `display:inline-block` \n\nsomethign like \n\n```\n<style>\n    .output_area {\n        display:inline-block;   \n    }\n</style>\n```\n\nOne thing I use is  `fig,axes = subplots(1,n)` \nAnd the oo way of matplotlib to draw.\n\nIt leads me to more reusable code in general, where I create a function that  `plotSomething(data,ax=None)` on `anAxis`\n\nthen I can do `plotSomething(data,axes[1])` , `plotSomething(otherData,axes[2])` and if I dont give it axes it create the axes itself.\n"
