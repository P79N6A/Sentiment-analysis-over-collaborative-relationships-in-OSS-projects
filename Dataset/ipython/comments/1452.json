    "body": "Sorry, I was a bit too hasty in proposing a fix. This doesn't actually work, because our `execfile` expects a second argument for the namespace. Grabbing the namespace of the calling scope is a rather horrible hack.\n\nI've worked out what we actually need to do for this. We should build a tiny new namespace with just execfile and a reference to prog_ns:\n\n```\nns = {'execfile': py3compat.execfile, 'prog_ns': prog_ns}\ndeb.run('execfile(\"%s\", prog_ns)' % filename, ns)\n```\n\nThat also avoids all the potential problems from modifying the user namespace. @dchetwynd , let us know if you want to have a go at this (it would be best as a new pull request).\n"
