Seems the docs and the 1.1.0 branch behavior aren't in sync.\n\nI followed the instructions here: http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/public_server.html#notebook-public-server\n\n...\n    Start by creating a certificate file and a hashed password, as explained above. Then create a custom profile for the notebook, with the following command line, type:\n\n```\n    $ ipython profile create nbserver\n\nIn the profile directory just created, edit the file ipython_notebook_config.py.\n```\n\nbut in the nbserver directory (or profile_default if i just run `ipython profile create`) ends up with a `ipython_config.py` only, no `ipython_notebook_config.py` as the docs suggest.\n\nI know it's not a huge problem, one can `cp ipython_config.py ipython_notebook_config.py` and go from there, since the files are pretty much all commented out anyway and such, but it certainly is a bit confusing.\n"

It's due to deps! when i first ran profile create i didn't have all the deps installed (pyzqm, jinja2) and it didn't create it; once i tried to create the config, then it failed b/c of missing deps, so i installed them, got the server running (then posted the above comment) \n\n**Now** when i run `ipython profile create`, as you say, it works as expected! :) \n\nOnly difference b/w then and now is that i installed the deps required to get notebook running.\n\nMaybe a simple note somewhere in the docs says, 'didn't create ipython_notebook_config.py, make sure you have all deps installed' :) for folks like me.\n\nThanks for the quick assistance!\n"
