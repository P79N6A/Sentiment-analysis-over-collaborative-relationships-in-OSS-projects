So you could do it that way - start the status as busy, and then set it to idle when you get the kernel reply.\n"

Couldn't you have a kernel that is able to treat\nkernel info request independently than executing code ? Cause the requested info are totally unrelated to the current state of what is beeing run.\n\nBut agreed for Python kernel. Will update other PR. \n\nDoes this prevent the addition of this utility function to the javascript ?\n"
