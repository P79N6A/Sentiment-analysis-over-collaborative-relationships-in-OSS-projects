The popup would say that this cell is protected from deletion  (with eventually an additional information on how to remove this \"lock\" or a pointer where to find this information).

    "body": "Ok, I've made the necessary changes and added a whole bunch of tests. I added a dialog warning the user (thanks for those examples @Carreau !):\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/83444/4397169/d2ebede6-443d-11e4-8b4d-0174491bc0fe.png)\n\nI also added a test utility function to handle waiting for a dialog to open, doing something, then waiting for it to close, then doing something else. I based this code off of what was in the `dualmode.js` tests, and then edited `dualmode.js` to use the utility function instead of what it had before.\n\nFinally, I realized that if we're preventing the deletion of cells, that should probably also imply:\n- Un-deletable cells should not be able to be merged with other cells\n- Un-deletable cells should not be able to be split into two cells\n- Copying and pasting an un-deletable cell should probably not result in another un-deletable cell\n\nThe last two commits implement these additional changes. If people don't like them I can revert those commits, but I think it makes sense to have that behavior because merging is a form of deletion, and then if we allow splitting it's kind of weird, because then you can split an undeletable cell but not merge it back together.\n\nIt is also currently problematic that the metadata is lost (and thus the cell becomes deletable) if the cell type is changed, which is a common thing to do accidentally. This will be fixed by #6472 though.\n"
