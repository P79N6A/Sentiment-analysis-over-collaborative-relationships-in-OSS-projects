    "body": "Hi @ivanov, I'm still seeing this problem in IPython 2.1. Won't be able to check master for another week as I'm on holiday. It's still a _huge_ problem for Windows QtConsole/Spyder users as it makes debugging extremely painful. \n\nI tried to debug myself but got nowhere. IIRC I traced the signal handler down to a Qt call where it got swallowed (my memory could be hazy though as it was nearly a couple of years ago now). I haven't followed up because I don't think the situation has changed - I don't have the skills to debug and since IIUC none of the core developers use windows or are Qt experts it's not been an itch anyone has felt like scratching. We've \"worked-around\" the problem by using PyCharm for serious debugging and training ourselves to never use the Ctrl-C to copy!\n\nI can post a followup with any further info that would help when I'm in the office next week...\n"
