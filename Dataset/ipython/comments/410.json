    "body": "Good catch on the installation stuff.  I haven't yet installed it other than by using develop.  In terms of MathJax, it is too big to include in the ipython repo as it includes all of the fonts.  I don't know of a good way of handling this yet.  The notebook.html file has an commented out script tag at the top that can be used to grab mathjax off of a CDN.  Let me look at a way this can happen automatically.\n"
