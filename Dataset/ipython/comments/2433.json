    "body": "Can you update your patch to conform to [PEP-8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)?  Mostly this means adding a space after commas and around comparison operators.  That is:\n\n``` py\nif platform != \"cli\":\n```\n\n``` py\nif isinstance(value, Int64):\n```\n\nAlso IPython's style is generally to use `import sys` and then `if sys.platform != 'cli':`.\n\nOverall this looks like a simple change and it seems pretty reasonable to me.  Do we need to check for `Int64` in the `Long` traitlet as well?\n"
