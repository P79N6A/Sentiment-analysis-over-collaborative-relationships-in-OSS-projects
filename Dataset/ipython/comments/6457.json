Also, I've decided that we should keep this image fairly basic, with no users. An image that builds from this one can install that.\n\n## On submodules\n\n[Our checking of submodules](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/71256f5f771a542589ffe9780cba1dbea0bffafb/IPython/utils/submodule.py#L75-L82) on build causes ADD to [not work right on Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/rgbkrk/ipython-latest/build_id/16709/code/bevwjzehiuzwyon9xbuwpog/) (local builds are fine).\n\nThe steps Docker Hub takes (straight from @metalivedev):\n\n> 1. git clone --recursive --depth 1 -b branch $URL\n> 2. Extract Readme and Dockerfile\n> 3. docker build -t tagname --nocache\n> 4. Tar and upload the build context to S3 bucket\n> 5. Push image (with all layers) to Registry\n> 6. Worker or Builder cleans up build residue (mounted volumes, etc)\n\nCurrently needing a workaround for that, otherwise I'll just clone it directly into the image and build from there. @Carreau any ideas?\n"
