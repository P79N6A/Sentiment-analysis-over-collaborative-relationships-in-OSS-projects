    "body": "I'm assuming that the reverse search feature you mean is either Ctrl-R or up-arrow? We load the last 1000 inputs into that search mechanism. There are a couple of workarounds available:\r\n\r\n- Use a magic function `%history -g pattern` to search the history database. It will show you numbers like `763/70` to identify inputs. You can use these with the `%recall` magic to bring a previous input to the prompt.\r\n- Increase the number of inputs loaded for rapid lookup by configuring `InteractiveShell.history_load_length` to e.g. 10000. Loading a lot of history may slow down startup; I haven't experimented with it.\r\n\r\nHistorically, we had no choice but to pre-load the terminal search when IPython started, because that was what readline required. Since IPython 5, we've switched to prompt_toolkit, which might make it possible to plug terminal history search into the database more directly. But it's probably fiddly, and we're used to living with the limitations I explained, so we haven't tried to do it yet."
