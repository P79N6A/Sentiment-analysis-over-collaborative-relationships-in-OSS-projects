    "body": "@fperez, Sure, anything that's likely to have multiple options should be configurable.  I don't think there's any inputhook configuration, so we really have two options:\n1. Configurable per-eventloop\n2. Single Configurable for the InputHookManager, that handles options \n\nWhile 2. is more extensible/O-O friendly, I think 1. would probably be cleaner in the long run.\nWe already need to make the timers in the Wx backend configurable as well (see #96).\n"

    "body": "Hi Nicolas,\n\nI'm really sorry you're having trouble!  As it turns out, this really was a fairly tricky rebase/merge to do, because it was going to _inevitably_ lead to conflicts, since the pyglet code and the glut one were pretty much in the same place.\n\nSo I went ahead and manually, carefully rebased the whole thing and cleared all the conflicts, ensuring that there's a glut branch that now sits cleanly on top of master (so it has the pyglet code in it).  You can get it here:\n\nhttps://github.com/fperez/ipython/tree/glut-rebased\n\nThis has the last changes you had pushed to github from your glut branch, but all rebased to apply correctly on top of master, with all conflicts against the pyglet code fixed.\n\nSo I suggest you grab my rebased branch above and start working from this one, if you had any additional local changes.\n\nBy the way, a very useful thing to know about git, when you get into trouble, is the `reflog` command.  This is a history of everything you've done in a git repo, for example in my ipython repo:\n\n<pre>\n0c6df48 HEAD@{0}: checkout: moving from rougier-glut to glut-rebased\n80f77d9 HEAD@{1}: checkout: moving from glut-rebased to rougier-glut\n0c6df48 HEAD@{2}: rebase: Added the command line option\n02ff6fe HEAD@{3}: rebase: Fix code in disable_glut which was not tested and quite buggy\ncf4c326 HEAD@{4}: rebase: Tried to fix the CTRL-C problem (https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/742) and take other comments/typos into account\n81308e3 HEAD@{5}: rebase: Replaced deprecated raise call\neb76eab HEAD@{6}: rebase: Fixed typos in comments\netc...\n</pre>\n\n\nIf you realize that any of those points was the one you wanted to be at, you can always manually go to it.  Let's say that 02ff6fe was a 'safe' point and that you want to undo things after that.  You can:\n\n<pre>\ngit checkout 02ff6fe\ngit branch \"new branch name here\"\n</pre>\n\n\nThe first command puts you in that point in the history, and the second makes it a named branch so you can start working again.\n\nSorry if this one turned out to be a little complicated, unfortunately the pyglet and glut changes were in the same parts of a file and they caused a conflict... But I'm willing to help you until we sort things out, so just let me know how it goes and I'm sure we'll be able to finish it.\n\nOnce you're OK again, we'll resume review.  There is enough complexity in the glut code that I'd like to break some of that into a separate file rather than having so many nested function definitions, which make the code very hard to read and test.\n"

I don't know why it disappeared from the comments, probably got lost in the rebase confusion.\n\nIn any case, if you now try to run ipython with `--gui glut`, you get these error messages:\n\n<pre>\n/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/lib/inputhook.py:289: SyntaxWarning: import * only allowed at module level\n  def enable_glut(self, app=None):\n/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/lib/inputhook.py:339: SyntaxWarning: import * only allowed at module level\n  def disable_glut(self):\n</pre>\n\n\nthe reason is that you are never allowed to say `from x import *`  _inside a function_.  The `import *` idiom is only allowed at the module level.  In a function, you can only use `from x import a, b, c`.\n\nI suggest that you always test your changes both with `--gui glut` and with `%gui glut`, to catch these issues.\n\nBut we're _almost_ there :) The crash is indeed gone, and the code looks much cleaner.  So once you fix the above little problem by importing specifically the functions you need, or using `import x; x.a()` inside your functions, I'll be able to merge.\n\nThanks for your patience in working through this, I know it's hard work but we need the code that goes in to be really clean and solid, as we'll need to maintain it for a long time to come...  This is one of the pull requests with the highest number of comments we've had in a while, but in the end I'm sure it will be worth it :)\n"
