    "body": "(sorry, didn't mean to close the issue)\n\nI'm not sure if this is a related or separate issue, but after restarting the kernel above by using Ctrl-., the kernel didn't actually successfully restart. Rather, it cleared the window, printed the header, and no prompt ever displayed. This isn't simply a console issue as if I try to connect a new console to the kernel (via --existing etc), the new console does exactly the same thing: it prints the header, but no prompts.\n\nin the meanwhile, i'm getting lots of these in the terminal that launched the original kernel/console:\nQTextCursor::setPosition: Position '28808' out of range\nQTextCursor::setPosition: Position '28808' out of range\nQTextCursor::setPosition: Position '28808' out of range\nQTextCursor::setPosition: Position '28808' out of range\nQTextCursor::setPosition: Position '28808' out of range\n\nwhen i look at the terminal during any session, there are heaps of these warnings. i'm running on ubuntu 11.04 if that's useful.\n"
