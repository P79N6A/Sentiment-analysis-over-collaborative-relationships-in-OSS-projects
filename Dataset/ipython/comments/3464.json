The only difference seems to be that 1.0 skips over no-op lines, while 0.12 requires one extra 'c' to get started (thus two before a single line of code is executed).\n\nIt is also not generally true that it \"finishes\" the script, because it will stop to debug at any breakpoints or exceptions.  It only runs to completion in this case because there is no bug to \"de-\".\n\nWould changing \"start your script\" to \"proceed with execution\" be satisfactory?\n"
