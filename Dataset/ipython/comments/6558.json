Otherwise, what I expect will happen is that users who don't have the correct kernel installed, but don't realize it, will open the notebook, not notice the message in the notification area, try to start running cells, and not be able to do anything, and get confused. Even if they notice it, they might not necessarily know what \"kernel not found\" means -- so I think we should open a modal dialog to make it really obvious that this is something they need to pay attention to. Perhaps we can also provide a link to documentation on installing kernels when that exists.\n"

They annoy users, and if they appear when you're trying to do something, many people will just click the thing that looks most like \"go away\" without paying any attention to the message.\n\nI agree that we need to think carefully about wording.

I guess I was thinking mainly about the case where you open a notebook with the intention of running it.\n\nWhat if there is no modal dialog, but if people try to run a cell, they get an error message which is informative? Currently, if you try to run a cell with no kernel, you will just get the asterisk in the `In` prompt and nothing else will ever happen.\n"

We had said we would do that before supporting selecting a kernel. But I got impatient building the kernel selection stuff, so I just implemented it with the current UI, knowing that we'd have to work out the details later. So ~nothing of the behaviour you see in master when you're missing the relevant kernel is by design.\n"
