    "body": "Well I guess that depends on your definition, if you split horizontally you get 2 buffer along the horizontal axis, which each looks vertical and vice versa.\n\nIt like those damed `[ on | x ]` `[ x | off]` buttons in iOS for some people what it written is the current state, for soem other it's what will happen if you switch. Not sure we can do much, there will always be someone that does not find it natural.\n\nI might not find it shocking as I'm not native english speaker, but a quick search on google image give 50/50 for both horizontal and vertical split, so I'm torn.\n"
