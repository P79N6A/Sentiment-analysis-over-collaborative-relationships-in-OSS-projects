    "body": "By 'autosaving', do you mean autosaving notebooks?\n\nThe notebook autosave mechanisms are completely separate from the history database - the kernel opens the history database, while saving notebooks is done by the Javascript and the notebook server.\n\nI guess you've run something using threads? In my experiment, each thread that's created shows another two handles on the database in lsof. But the file descriptors are the same (47 & 49 in your example), so I don't think it's actually reopening it, just an artefact of the way lsof shows threads.\n"
