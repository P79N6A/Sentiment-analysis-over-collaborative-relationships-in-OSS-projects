    "body": "I can confirm this, but I don't know if we can do anything about it - AFAIK, completions are displayed by readline, and the Python bindings for readline don't expose the necessary function (rl_set_screen_size, I think) to tell readline that the terminal has been resized.\n\nWhat's confusing is [this bug report](http://bugs.python.org/issue3948) saying that readline installs a SIGWINCH handler, which is what it would use to pick up terminal resize events. If it's doing that, we shouldn't need to do anything for this to work correctly.\n"

    "body": "From Chet Ramey:\n\nAs I recall from looking briefly at the ipython/python source code, it has\nto do with python not handling the SIGWINCH and expecting readline to do\nit even when readline is not active.  In readline-6.3, readline only\ninstalls its signal handlers when rl_callback_read_char is called, which\npython does only when it receives a character and its select(2) call\nreturns.  The way readline-6.2 and earlier did things, it could `steal'\nsignals from an application without being active.  I think python doesn't\nhandle SIGWINCH at all, which means that it expects readline's signal\nhandler to be active all the time, instead of just when python calls back\ninto readline to have it read a character.\n\nA possible fix would be to have python's readline module install a signal\nhandler for SIGWINCH and have it set readline's idea of the screen size.\n"
