I guess (1) is too generic for non-dev person like me to write (well, I can try, though).  I feel (2) is too specific for an IPEP, comparing to the existing ones.  For (2), I guess discussion in this PR will do the job.  I can start (3), but I have no other request options I can think of at this moment.\n\nAlso, for history search request, I don't think we need protocol extension system (1), because if a specific client needs a specific history request mechanism, that client can load its own Python module in the kernel and then send the request back to the client via JSON repr.  But that means IPython should provide `core.history.HistoryAccessor` as a public API, or the client ends up relying on internal implementation of IPython.  I think providing full-access to `core.history.HistoryAccessor` options via messaging protocol is much cleaner than making `core.history.HistoryAccessor` public.  I am not saying that protocol extension system is unnecessary.  I just don't think history search request protocol require the extension system.\n\n> Then we'll bump the version number, implement what need to be done.\n\nWhat version number?  IPython?  Or are we going to have a protocol version number?\n"

    "body": "I think @Carreau is talking about a versioned protocol, and suggesting that we have an IPEP for 'kernel messaging protocol 1.1' (or 2, or whatever it gets called). By rough analogy, [Python] PEP 3154 is for 'pickle protocol version 4'.\n\nI can see the sense behind that - a third party client like EIN will clearly need to know whether the kernel supports the fields it wants to use.
