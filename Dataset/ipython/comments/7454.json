This would allow us to keep the main visible name short and focused on the language, while allowing a user to dig deeper into the actual project providing that language.\n\nSounds like you are using the project name in a different way to handle certain types of errors? Can you describe a bit more of the motivation?\n"

    "body": "I wasn't addressing the text on hover at all, I'm not sure how or why that would differ from display_name. This is purely meant to address the issue that the necessarily 1:1 _name_ of the kernelspec doesn't address the 1:many reality of notebook:kernel compatibility.\n\nFor example: I have 6 IPython kernels right now, for various distributions and debug use cases. If I create a notebook and associate it with my 'python3-debug' kernel, you should still be able to open it, as long as you have _any_ IPython kernel.\n\nAn alternative could be to copy some subset of the language_info we get from the kernel_info request back into the kernelspec (where it started), and use that to identify compatibility.\n\nWe could also punt on this question entirely, and only keep the dialog used when no _identical_ kernel can be found. That would mean that any user running Python 2 would get a dialog saying \"I couldn't find a Python 3 kernel\" whenever they open an example notebook.\n"

    "body": "Ahh, Ok thanks for the explanation. Now I understand this PR much better.\n\nHmm, it seems like tackling the whole kernel compatibility thing in an automated way is a bit crazy. While there are definitely some obvious cases where there is a clear answer, there are others where it will be difficult. Here is one proposal:\n- If a kernel for a notebook doesn't exist, open the notebook and let the user pick which installed kernel they want to use. If they don't have any kernel then they can pick the best one and at least edit the notebook and not run code.\n- Just use the project name as I described above - for human usage in on hover events to learn more about a kernel so if there are 2 kernels with the display name \"Python 2\" they can see i) the name of the kernel and ii) the name of the project.\n\nAnother idea would be for us to implement and provide a \"null\" kernel that does nothing, but allows a users to edit a notebook. But it would at least have all of the right keyboard events hooks up to make cell execution do nothing in a good way.\n"
