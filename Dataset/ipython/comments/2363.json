    "body": "Cameron,\n\nHi, on had a quick look at this and, unless I don't understand what this is\ndoing, I think we need to steer clear of tightly coupling the notebook\nformat to the notebook server details.  Consider the following:\n- Someone writes a completely different notebook server or maybe even a\n  native app.  This other notebook server/native app would have no idea what\n  to do with this metadata attribute and the notebook would behave the same\n  for those users.\n- We rewrite the internals of the notebook server (this is actually going\n  to happen) and completely break the model of what you are doing, so that\n  everyone who has notebooks with this metadata attribute have broken\n  notebooks.\n- The Ruby folks decid they love the notebook format and start to use it in\n  ways we never intended, completely decoupled from our notebook server.\n\nAlso, from a philosophical perspective, we need to keep a very long term,\nbig picture for the notebook format, including various metadata attributes.\n\nBut the bigger question is this: why do you want this capability?  Maybe\nthen we can see if there is a way of supporting it with less coupling\nbetween the format and server.\n\nOne final note about design ideas for the notebook.  We want to _minimize_\nthe configurability/customizability of the notebook (it commits us to\nbrittle implementation details) and maximize the reusability of it (create\nmodular building block that other people can assemble in cool new ways).\n From this perspective, I feel this commit is going in the wrong direction.\n\nNote that moving to jinja2 will help us build a more modular code base -\nit's just the first step though.\n\nOn Tue, Sep 25, 2012 at 1:53 PM, Cameron Bates notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> The commit is at: c05ad05https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/c05ad05b676fa95cb254c935c84817c59954a0ad.\n> It checks for the template metadata object in a notebook when loaded and\n> render the notebook using notebook.html in the provided absolute directory.\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/2363#issuecomment-8869863.\n\n## \n\nBrian E.

    "body": "Matthias,\n\nThere are multiple layers of vulnerability here:\n\na) A user loading a notebook (but not running anything) and _at load_\nmalicious JavaScript code running.\nb) A user running Python code that sends malicious HTML/JS output that is\nthen run on the page.\n\nAs far as (a) is concerned, it should never ever happen.  The problem with\n(a) is that this vulnerability happens at page load literally before the\nuser even get's to see the code that is about to be run.  As far as I know,\nthe only way that (a) can happen is with <script> tags in markdown cells.\n If we clean <script> tags from markdown cells we have solved this problem.\n\nSolving (b) is both easier and more difficult to solve:\n\nIt is easier because <B) can only happen as a result of a direct user\naction and that action is precisely the user's request to run arbitrary\ncode.  The bottom line is that when you run code, in the notebook or\nelsewhere, you better trust it 100% or you shouldn't run it.  Even if we\ncompletely disabled dynamic JS in notebooks this will always be the case =\n\"don't run notebooks you don't trust 100%\".\n\nBut, the fact the Js code can be dynamically generated and run in the\nbrowser does introduce additional vulnerabilties.  The main one is that Js\ncode gets run in an authenticated context - the malicious Js code can not\nonly mess up the server it can also do things on the net on behalf of the\nuser.\n\n> The only reliable way would be :\n> 1 - To strip js from **all** output ( markdown and codecell)\n> 2 - To sandbox each cell with html5-iframe.\n> \n> There is no way we wish to go back to 1. or display Js is useless.\n> \n> Yep.\n> \n> With 2 js would be restricted in it's div with no way of leaking outside.\n> The timeout would be killed on MD regeneration.\n> when using display_javascript, we could allow a specific flag, explicitly\n> set that allow the iframe to access parent namespace.\n> \n> I don't know enough about the execution context of iframes yet.  Could the\n> iframe's Javascript still access the global IPython Js objects, such as\n> Notebook and Kernel?  In order to support JS code that makes calls back\n> into the kernel, it would need to.  My feeling is that if the sandboxing is\n> solid enough to prevent these vulnerabilities, it will also prevent the\n> iframe from accessing these things (that we want it to access).\n\nHere is my current thinking on the issue.\n- We either allow dynamic JS or we don't.  If we do, we need to accept the\n  vulnerabilities and mitigate them through other means.\n- These vulnerabilities are primarily relevant in multiuser authenticated\n  contexts.  In those contexts I am thinking we could introduce the notion of\n  \"trusted\" notebooks and could build that into any web applications.\n  Basically, in order for code to be trusted, it has to be \"reviewed and\n  approved\" by others.  We could then build the web app to completely\n  disallow JS/HTML output when running non-trusted code.  Basically, we would\n  be developing a way that forces people to be careful about the notebooks\n  they are running and require explicit approval to have JS/HTML output.\n  There are a number of different ways we could manage this approval\n  process.  I view this as a social rather than technical approach to the\n  issue.\n\nBut I think we need to investigate exactly what the limitations of iframes\nare to see what level of features/security they provide.\n\nBut, being security, I also worry that I am drastically misunderstanding\neverything.\n\nI don't know if it is possible, but we could even listen on wether the\n\n> iframe is trying to access parent window, and make it red with a\n> warning :\n> \"This iframe is trying to access global name space :\n> \n> ## allow it ?
