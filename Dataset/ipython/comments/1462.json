    "body": "It shouldn't, or at least not negatively.  There are two levels of timeout related to registration and the heartbeat:\n1. in the Hub, the timeout is the longer out of: two heartbeat periods or five seconds.  This measures the time between the initial registration_request message, and the first beat of the engine's heart.  If this timeout is reached, the engine is considered DOA, and can never register.  I am not aware if this timeout _ever_ having been reached by an engine that hasn't died.\n2. in the test suite itself, there is a timeout of five (or ten?) seconds for engines to be added to the list before the test assumes there was a problem with registration.  This timeout _includes_ the time between requesting the ipengine subprocess to start, and its sending of the first message, which is why it sometimes fails on slow machines/VMs.  Since the time to successfully register is proportional to the heartbeat period, this change should actually make the ShiningPanda timeout _less_ likely.\n"
