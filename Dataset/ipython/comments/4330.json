    "body": "I've been thinking about something similar to @dmoco though via somewhat of a different approach. I have code in a fork that implements the concept of having and viewing viewing different levels of detail in the same notebook.\n\nCells of any type can be given a detail level value in their metadata and a slider is added to the main toolbar that controls the level at which the notebook is being viewed. Any cell which is at a detail level above what is currently viewed (newly loaded notebooks are viewed at level 1) are both disabled and hidden (so select next, etc skips over them and works as one would expect given what is visible). \n\nThe idea here is that educators (this idea is broadly applicable beyond education but I'm sticking to the motivating example for this IPEP) would be able to write extra detail in terms of notes, in-place computations and verbose informative printing, etc, that would not be shown unless the student desired more information about what the notebook was talking about.\n\nI could look at putting together a PR against master if that is something there is interest in.\n"
