    "body": "@ShaneOfAllTrades That would mean catching the error in the right place, and raising a 404 with a custom message.\nI don't remember exactly, but I think it was based on subclassing handler and defining a custom write_error message. [cf docs or write/send Error on 2.2 ](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/branch2.2/web.html#tornado.web.RequestHandler.send_error) and [v 3](http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/web.html?highlight=write_error#tornado.web.RequestHandler.send_error).\n\nNot particularly difficult, I guess, but haven't done it a lot.\n\nThis would just show a big page with a custom message. One could also gracefully fail to create and continue the process, but displaying something in the UI through JS, but this one is more difficult and not necessary.\n\nIf you need any more pointer to a particular file if you want to attempt to do it just ask.\n"
