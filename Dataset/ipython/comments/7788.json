Currently, the \"click here\" doesn't look like something you can click: no mouse change when mouse over.\n2. You can upload any type of file, not just notebooks. \n3. \"import\" may not be the correct word; maybe \"upload\" is better\n\nSo, a button that says \"Upload\" and mouse over that says \"Drag and drop files to upload, or click button to select them\".\n"
