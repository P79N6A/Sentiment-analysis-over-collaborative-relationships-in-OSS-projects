    "body": "Aha, yes, this was another part of the reorganisation to make the frontend more language agnostic. Previously, the tooltip got a bunch of semi-semantic but quite Python specific info, and that was formatted by JS code. Now it gets text back from the kernel and displays it as is, so what you see is the same as when you do `tips.groupby?`.\n\nI've also noticed that this information is not brilliant for tooltip presentation - see issue #7759 for some reorganisation I want to do.\n\nI also have a more ambitious plan with @ccordoba12 to adapt some code from Spyder to render a nicer HTML presentation of docstrings.\n"
