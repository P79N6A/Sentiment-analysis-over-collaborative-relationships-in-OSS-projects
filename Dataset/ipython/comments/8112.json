    "body": "@juhasch ???!!! Thanks! That does work... no idea why.  Note that the MathJax documentation has _no_ quotes. Also, how does this work when `custom.js` is loaded after the `Configured()` call?\n\nInjecting configurations explicitly with either `%%javascript` or `HTML` still fails, but I at least have a work-around now:\n1. Include the relevant configuration in `custom.js` with the quotes.  This will configure the notebook in the live server.  For example, the following enables the Neo-Euler font scaled to match Palatino as the body font:\n\n``` javascript\nMathJax.Hub.Config({\n  \"HTML-CSS\": {\n      availableFonts: [\"Neo-Euler\"], preferredFont: \"Neo-Euler\",\n      webFont: \"Neo-Euler\",\n      mtextFontInherit: true,\n      matchFontHeight: true,\n      scale: 85, // Euler is a bit big.\n  },\n  \"SVG\": {\n      font: \"Neo-Euler\",\n  },\n  \"TeX\": {\n    Macros: {\n      d: [\"\\\\mathrm{d}\"],\n      vect: [\"{\\\\vec #1}\",1],\n      abs: [\"{\\\\lvert #1 \\\\rvert}\",1]\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n1. Include a `<script>` tag in the markdown as the last cell of the notebook.  This will get rendered in the HTML file produced by NBConvert for viewing on NBServer:\n\n`````` HTML\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nMathJax.Hub.Config({\n  \"HTML-CSS\": {\n      availableFonts: [\"Neo-Euler\"], preferredFont: \"Neo-Euler\",\n      webFont: \"Neo-Euler\",\n      mtextFontInherit: true,\n      matchFontHeight: true,\n      scale: 85, // Euler is a bit big.\n  },\n  \"SVG\": {\n      font: \"Neo-Euler\",\n  },\n  \"TeX\": {\n    Macros: {\n      d: [\"\\\\mathrm{d}\"],\n      vect: [\"{\\\\vec #1}\",1],\n      abs: [\"{\\\\lvert #1 \\\\rvert}\",1]\n    }\n  }\n});\n</script>\n\n3. Include any customizations in a LaTeX style file for latex conversion.\n\n```latex\n\\usepackage[small]{eulervm}\n\\newcommand{\\vect}[1]{\\vec{#1}}\n\\newcommand{\\abs}[1]{\\lvert#1\\rvert|}\n\\let\\d\\relax  % \\d already defined and there is no \\RedeclareMathOperator\n\\DeclareMathOperator{\\d}{d}\n``````\n\nIt would still be nice if there was a solution that worked without having to modify a users `custom.js` file or NBConvert templayes, but perhaps that is all reasonable via an extension (have not fully figured that out yet.)  In any case, this at least gives a way forward.\n\nThe issue about the quotes needs to be addressed somewhere though. Should I open a new ticket? (I really have no idea at this point why it works with quotes.)\n"
