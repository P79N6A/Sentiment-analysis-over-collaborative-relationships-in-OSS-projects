That form _is_ more conventional, but I'm not sure this is something worth supporting redundancy and/or breaking historical consistency.  I'd be fine with dropping the new name, and returning to the old one.\n"

    "body": "I've been scanning external projects that use IPython, and all of them use IPYTHONDIR (esp. since most were developed in the 0.10 days).  While I also prefer the _ form, I do think this is unnecessary breakage of user code.  I think it's ok that we break things when we absolutely must, but this one probably isn't needed.\n\nQuestion: should we at least update the docs in 0.12 to mention IPYTHONDIR?  I don't want to touch the actual _code_ this late in the game, but since the code supports both, right now it's just a matter of steering our userbase in one direction or another from the documentation.  If we're going to flip the order in 0.13 and add a warning, it would be good to point people towards the right option as early as possible.\n"
