    "body": "I think handling it in displayhook would lead to unexpected behaviour. Specifically, if I do `for a in range(5): a`, I would expect to see either five outputs or none.\n\nTwo possible ways to do this in AST side: we can run the last node interactively only if it's an expression, or we can run the last node which is an expression interactively, then switch back to exec mode for the remaining nodes. I think I would find the former behaviour less surprising (that is, only the last node can produce output).\n"
