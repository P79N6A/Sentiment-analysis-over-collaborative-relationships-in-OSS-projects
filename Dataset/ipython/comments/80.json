If the user gives the --cluster-dir option to specify a cluster_dir, it currrently looks in cwd, but only proceeds if the directory already exists.  That is fine for start/stop, but awkward for create as it requires the user to first create the directory using mkdir and then to ipcluster create.  Basically, create needs to handle finding the cluster dir differently than start/stop.  What is also awkward is that start can also auto create the cluster dir, but it should do so differently than create.  But what if ipcluster start is run with the --cluster-dir option?\n\nSplitting IPClusterApp into different sub apps will enable us to better utilize custom logic for each app.\n"
