    "body": "Yeah, it is a simple solution - the difference is that regular casting does not require the value to be preserved - e.g. there are some situations where CInt(0.5) should probably raise, as 0 may not be acceptable, nor was it actually specified.\n\nBut it also means that we should _never_ use non-casting traits (Int at least), since they suffer from this silly error.\n\nThe smallest possible change is to allow ints given as unnecessary longs, and not do any other casting.  This would protect us from forward-looking libraries thinking of python 3, where all ints are longs.  Real traits do raise on this, but I would honestly consider that a bug in traits, as I consider it a bug in traitlets.\n"
