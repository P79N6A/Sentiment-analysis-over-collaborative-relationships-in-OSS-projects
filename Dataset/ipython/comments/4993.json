So if we do that, it will not be in 2.0 we are too close to release. \n\nas for the test in the notebook they are done using [casper js here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/tree/master/IPython/html/tests/casperjs)\n\nThis make me thing that test should fail if message spec have unknown field, shoudln'd they ?\n"

Maybe this should be something more along the lines of a global mode for the notebook (and it could then apply to 'run all after' and 'run all before' too). Maybe @fperez (who originally suggested #1977) has some thoughts on this?\n\nThere's no rush on my side, but I just started working on this because I wanted to get a bit more familiar with the notebook code. \n"
