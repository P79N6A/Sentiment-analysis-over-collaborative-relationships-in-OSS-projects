In general, we don't override any Ctrl shortcuts, because it almost always conflicts with something in the browser. The only exception we make is Ctrl-S, because browser save is not very useful on a notebook.\n\nIf you want to customise the shortcuts for your own use, that should be possible. @Carreau probably recalls the details of how to do that better than I do.\n\nFor an advanced example of customising keyboard shortcuts, see [ipython-vimception](https://github.com/ivanov/ipython-vimception).\n"
