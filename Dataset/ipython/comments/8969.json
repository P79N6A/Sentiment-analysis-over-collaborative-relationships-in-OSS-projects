    "body": "I have the same issue: images get written directly in my `doc` directory, and the generated rst contains path like `build/html/_static/Cube1.png`. And Sphinx issues warnings because it cannot find the image files. I think the error come from https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/fd6e72da7a4dcf73083264d2596c78fa570ee38d cc @minrk \nIf get back to IPython 4.0 then it works. \nBefore the commit, `savefig_dir = os.path.join(confdir, savefig_dir)` gave the `doc/_static` path. Now it gives `doc/build/html/_static/`.\n\nOk, found the issue I think: if the output directory does not exists, which is the case for a clean build, `bookmark ipy_savedir` fails and maybe bookmark the current directory ?\n"
