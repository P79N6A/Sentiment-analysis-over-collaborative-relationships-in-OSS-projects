If taking the apt-get approach suggested here you also need to issue an apt-get update beforehand to ensure all the correct packages are available. \n\nThe script is much simpler now. The linked provisioning shell script also returns control back to the host shell from the VM. For some reason iptest dosen't install under these conditions:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/cameronneylon/5566750\n"
