But as Thomas said, in ipython proper\nthere's _zero_ C code, so we can't cause a segfault directly (well,\nand we're not doing funky ctypes stuff either).  But we can easily\n(inadvertently) set up the conditions for one  to be triggered.\n\nIn a sense, it's great that ipython makes this segfault more likely to\nhappen: you can help the rpy2 developers fix _their_ bug by having a\nsemi-reliable way of causing it.  They could perhaps force a core dump\nwith a debug build of rpy2 (that has symbols enabled) to pinpoint\nwhere it's coming from.\n\nWe're not trying to dismiss your concern, just to point you in the\ndirection where effort will be productive.  The bug needs to be fixed\nin rpy2, where it's actually coming from, so no amount of looking at\nipython is going to help you with that.\n\nRegards,\n\nf\n"
