    "body": "We can try some designs that colors the brackets as well. \r\n\r\nWe will definitely offer a \"do your own logo kit\" and those versions will likely not need any custom kerning - mostly pick the font/color and type it out.\r\n\r\nI agree the different colors are stronger, but it would be much more difficult to come up with a set of colors that different projects can use and maintain a strong sense of brand. Allowing people to pick any color is also really difficult for the same reason. One option would be to keep the blue for our official usage, and then find a small number of other colors that third party projects can use. How does that sound?\r\n\r\nIn terms of the font, I am more than willing to do a walkthrough of the different fonts we tried if there is interest.\r\n\r\nAny other feedback? "

This is where Sylvain's logo shine IMHO. There \"close enough\" to convey IPython. Far enough to raise confusion with Official. I would be happy to see exploration further from initial design.\r\n\r\nI'm also looking forward to see exploration on similar things for Jupyter."
