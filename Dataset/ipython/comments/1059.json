I'd say that `__IPYTHON__` is for b), and I guess we don't really have anything special for a), because `get_ipython` gets injected into enough places that even a plain `%run` (without `-i`) will see it.  Perhaps we should add another flag, say `__IPYTHON__interactive` for this, that would _only_ be written to the user_ns when we prepare it?  Kind of a mouthful, but if that sound like a good idea we can mull on the name.\n"
