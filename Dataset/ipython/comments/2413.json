You appear to have paused the video just before he types `inline`.\n\nI'm not sure why you don't see any plots - if you use pylab without inline mode, plots should just pop up as new windows. If you try with inline mode, do you see the graphs?\n\n(Sorry I didn't understand earlier - I didn't know your video had sound, and I was watching it quickly)\n"
