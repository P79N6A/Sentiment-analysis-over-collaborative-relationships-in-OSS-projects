I know there are various HTML to PDF tools out there; I don't know how well any of them will handle slides. In a pinch, you could use Selenium to auto-drive a real browser and print to PDF.\n2. Create a Latex template that uses Beamer to create slides.\n\nIf you're feeling adventurous, you could also go looking at ways to create PDFs directly, like reportlab.\n"
