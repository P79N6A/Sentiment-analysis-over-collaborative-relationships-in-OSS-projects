    "body": "I looked at this again, and here is what I found:\n1. Above mentioned cython snippet fails because of `erf` function. That function in available only on Posix systems, and is not part of ANSI C/C++ (revealed by Google). So it's not good idea this snippet to be included in example notebook.\n2. Next little snippet:\n\n``` python\n%%cython -lm\nfrom libc.math cimport sin\nprint 'sin(1)=', sin(1)\n```\n\nfails with this error:\n\n```\nLinkError: command '\"c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\VC\\BIN\\link.exe\"' failed with exit status 1181\n```\n\nwhich suggests according Google search that created module/library can't be found.\n\nI wonder how this lives for so long. Does any Windows IPython user run Cython magic, or care enought to report or is it just problem on my PC?\n"
