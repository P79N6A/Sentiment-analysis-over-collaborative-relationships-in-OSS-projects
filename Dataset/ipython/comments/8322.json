I guess we need a mechanism to switch back to regular save, but that's horrible because it leaves it up to the user to understand the issue and change the setting.

    "body": "IPython makes those as temporary files, but in normal situations they will be immediately renamed to replace the notebook file you're saving. Something Dropbox is doing is keeping copies of them around.\n\nI hate this situation because it's a feature we added to fix a horrible, albeit rare, user experience - losing a notebook because of a failed save. It turns out that the fix makes things worse in other important use cases, but we have no reliable way of telling when these use cases are happening.\n\nWe could use `/tmp` (or platform equivalent) for atomic save, and fall back to regular non-atomic save if that's not on the same filesystem as the directory we're saving too. That would improve things for Dropbox and similar sync tools, but it would still clobber the permissions in @LightServant's case. And it would be extra complexity, so it might cause extra problems.\n"
