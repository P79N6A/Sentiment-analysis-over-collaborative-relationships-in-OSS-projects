Given that it appears that the platform_python_implementation system hasn't been reliably implemented, it may be that we have to move this dependency down to 'terminal'. Obviously, we don't want it to be impossible to install IPython on pypy, but we also do want to enforce gnureadline as a hard dependency on CPython on OS X.\n"
