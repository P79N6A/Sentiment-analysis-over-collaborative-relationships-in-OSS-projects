    "body": "There is no particular process as far as I can tell. \r\n\r\nUsually if someone has been regularly involved in the project and the contributions are of quality, and we feel a dev _knows_ ipython,  one of the current core dev likely propose the contributor as a new core member. Usually Fernando PÃ©rez (the IPython creator) have the last word on this, and will send a personal mail to the said-dev asking if they want to have commit rights as way to show that you are part of the core. \r\n\r\nIn practice it does not change much, as contribution and input from a regular dev are taken into consideration long before you get commit right, I still remember having done quite a bit of work on the QtConsole and being trusted on decision and architectures well before having the right to push the green button.\r\n\r\nGetting commits right often means that you actually have to take harder decision, reviews more PRs, and learn to say \"no\" to many things. \r\n\r\nIn the above I purposely use \"contribution\" instead of commits, as commits is not the only metric we use. Responding to issues, and to users on the mailing list, twitter etc are also valued.\r\n\r\nHere is [my (and `@ivanov`)](https://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/ipython-dev/2012-April/009044.html) annonce on the mailing list of new core members. \r\n\r\nHope that give you some insights.

    "body": ":-) We're glad you're interested in being more involved, and thanks for your work so far removing old compatibility code.\r\n\r\nWhat else do we look for? Helping other people is always useful. There are questions to answer on [jupyter/help](https://github.com/jupyter/help), on the mailing list and on Stackoverflow. There are other contributors making pull requests which need to be reviewed. In both cases, we're not looking at comment counts, so find things where you think your input will be helpful.\r\n\r\nAnother route is to specialise in a particular area of the project, so that you become the person we call when something goes wrong in it. As Matthias mentioned, he was doing quite a bit with the Qt console early on. I got into the project doing Python 3 support back when that was niche. Carol has a particular interest in good documentation. If you include Jupyter, it's a big project with many pieces, but if you let us know your interests and experience, we can try to point you to parts you might like.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get more familiar with the existing team, watch some of our development meetings (Mondays, currently 1700 UTC, and posted on Youtube afterwards). If you're going to any SciPy or PyData conferences, see if any of us are going to be there to meet you.\r\n\r\nHowever you do it, be aware that it will likely take a fair bit of time and commitment before you get merge rights. The good news is that merge rights aren't all that important: we all work through pull requests anyway, so you can contribute very effectively without merge rights."
