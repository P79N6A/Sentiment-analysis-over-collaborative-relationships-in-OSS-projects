If you are also collapsing all the output widgets into the cell's output, you'll see a duplication of outputs.  Additionally, collapsing all the output widgets is non-trivial since children can be stored in any List traitlet (not just `children`).\n\nI think when we decide on a way to persist the widget state to the disk, we can revisit the idea of using output widgets with interact.  Until then, https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/7703 .\n"
