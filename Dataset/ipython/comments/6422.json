Based on that I am going to close this PR. If @fperez disagrees, he can override and re-open the PR.\n\n@cbuehler and @dsblank are you willing to take the lead on that conversation with John? If so, can you create an issue where we can outline the points we would bring to John?\n"

It looks very specific to our needs. Also, I'm not saying that the IPython team needs to implement this, but it looks like a larger project specific to the Jupyter notebook context.\n\nHope that helps move forward towards a solution!\n"

    "body": "Doug, thanks!\n\nLet's broaden the topic of this issue to include all Markdown extensions\nthat would might need (equations as well).\n\nOn Wed, Sep 10, 2014 at 10:46 AM, Doug Blank notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> I'd be glad to help discuss and explore options, but I am not an unbiased\n> observer :) I have come to believe:\n> - to support reproducible research, there should be a way to include\n>   the bibtex-like bibliography source data in the notebook (not that it would\n>   have to be included, but if one wanted to, it could)\n> - the bibliography support should be visualizable in running and\n>   static notebooks\n> - the format (MLA, APA, engineering) should be dynamically changeable:\n>   style should be reflected in author names/page numbers in citations in\n>   text, and in bibliography Sources Cited sections.\n> - there should be hyperlinks between citations in text and references\n>   in Bibliography (like wikipedia)\n> \n> Thus, I'm not sure that all of this can be solved outside of Jupyter. It\n> looks very specific to our needs. Also, I'm not saying that the IPython\n> team needs to implement this, but it looks like a larger project specific\n> to the Jupyter notebook context.\n> \n> Hope that helps move forward towards a solution!\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6422#issuecomment-55153697.\n\n## \n\nBrian E.
