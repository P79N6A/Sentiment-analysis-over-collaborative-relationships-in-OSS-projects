It notices when `NSApp:run` finishes without having triggered the callback on the inputhook FD, and then continues the lower-level eventloop instead of returning. This appears to be because closing the last Window triggers NSApp:stop, but doesn't (for some reason that I don't understand) finish processing the events necessary to actually close that Window.\n\nI also tried running CFRunLoop directly instead of invoking NSApp ever, but this doesn't seem to get the GUI events necessary to interact with the Windows.\n\nI'm pretty confident there's a better way to do it, but I don't know what it is and this works, so I'm okay with it.\n"

    "body": "This problem seemed solved to me sometime around when this issue closed in August, though I can't remember precisely. However, as for @nirum, it has reappeared recently, again I can't say if it corresponded to a particular update.\n\nThe scope seems to be a little smaller now. Figures close normally in the GUI interface when I press `⌘w` (`<CMD-W>`) or click the close window button `ⓧ`. The window disappears, and the figure is no longer listed in `plt.get_fignums()`.\n\nHowever, if I run `plt.close` (with any argument, as long as it ends up closing all figures), then all the figures remain open (i.e., visible in the GUI) but they're grey and frozen (trying to interact via the GUI gives the spinning beach ball). After this, `plt.get_fignums()` returns an empty list.\n\nCreating a new figure closes the frozen figure(s) and proceeds as normal.
