    "body": "I have been able to reproduce this. The culprit is the `certifi` package, which is a dependency of tornado, the webserver the IPython notebook uses. When I run the example, I get the following probably-relevant warnings from requests:\n\n```\n(debug) user@229b335c7df5:/# python -c \"import requests; requests.get('https://www.google.com')\"\n/debug/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/packages/urllib3/util/ssl_.py:315: SNIMissingWarning: An HTTPS request has been made, but the SNI (Subject Name Indication) extension to TLS is not available on this platform. This may cause the server to present an incorrect TLS certificate, which can cause validation failures. For more information, see https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html#snimissingwarning.\n  SNIMissingWarning\n/debug/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/requests/packages/urllib3/util/ssl_.py:120: InsecurePlatformWarning: A true SSLContext object is not available. This prevents urllib3 from configuring SSL appropriately and may cause certain SSL connections to fail. For more information, see https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html#insecureplatformwarning.\n  InsecurePlatformWarning\n```\n\nI'm guessing the \"may cause certain SSL connections to fail\" is relevant here. SSLContext was backported to Python 2.7.9 as a security fix, and may be what's needed here. There might be a question for either the certifi or requests folks for why there is an error.\n"
