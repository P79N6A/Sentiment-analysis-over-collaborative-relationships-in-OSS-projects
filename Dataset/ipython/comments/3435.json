    "body": "I don't think that can be an IPython bug - our code is pure Python, so it can't be directly responsible for segfaults.\n\nIf you can reproduce it in the plain Python interpreter, you may want to file a [bug with Python itself](bugs.python.org). But it may also be a problem in some extension module that it's trying to load; I don't know how to debug that.\n"
