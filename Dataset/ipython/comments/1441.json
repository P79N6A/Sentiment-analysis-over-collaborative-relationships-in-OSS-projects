    "body": "You have correctly identified a problem with our Javascript code, but\nI don't think this solution will work.  We need to make sure that\nevery call to execute is correctly hooked up with code that can handle\nthe output appropriately.  That requires a good bit of refactoring to\nKernel, Notebook and Cell.  We have already started to design the\nreplacement API for this but it is going to take a bit of work to pull\nit off.  Because these APIs are going to be public, we really need to\nget them right.  We are getting ready to release 0.13 and this work\nwill need to wait until after that.  With any work on the notebook, we\nhighly recommend contacting us on list first because of the fast pace\nthings are moving at.  We appreciate your contribution though and\n_definitely_ want to enable this type of thing.  We will let the list\nknow when we are ready to start on this work.\n\nOn Sun, Feb 26, 2012 at 9:49 PM, Jason Chin\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\n> (1) If \"IPython.notebook.kernel.execute\" is called without a cell attached, the \"display_javascript\" or \"display_html\" is currently ignored by Notebook.prototype.handle_shell_reply() since there is no cell associated with the python code execution request.  The patch allows the message type \"display_data\" to be accepted by Notebook.prototype.handle_shell_reply() even there is no \"cell\" attached with the initial IPython.notebook.kernel.execute() request.  (For a better design, we might consider to assign such call with special cell id, or make a new type of message.)\n> \n> (2) Removing html insertion for \"display_*\" calls. If we put \"display_javascript\" in a loop, the current noteboot will insert empty html elements and the output cell might become longer (and empty) than necessary. It looks cleaner not generating those empty element.\n> \n> The patches can allow to execute python through html element, e.g., a button created with javascript in an ipython html notebook. (one example: https://github.com/cschin/IPython-Notebook---d3.js-mashup/blob/master/GDP_CO2_Example.ipynb )\n> \n> You can merge this Pull Request by running:\n> \n>  git pull https://github.com/cschin/ipython 3a34d3b0c4d42bb1ef7b42660b12d429936cb287\n> \n> Or you can view, comment on it, or merge it online at:\n> \n>  https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/1441\n> \n> -- Commit Summary --\n> - Allowing to publish javascript within the code being passed through IPython.notebook.kernel.execute(code).
