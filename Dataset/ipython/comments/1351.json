    "body": "@minrk, thanks for the reply. I've modified my local version of this patch to handle ImportError for IPython.zmq.\nTo allow <code>embed_kernel</code> access to <code>user_ns</code>, I'm guessing something like <code>InteractiveShellEmbed.mainloop</code> would be required? I can't quite see how to achieve that with <code>IPKernelApp</code>.\n"
