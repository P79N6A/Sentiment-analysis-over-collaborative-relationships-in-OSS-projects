    "body": "I'm happy enough to use the `compress_user` function to abbreviate the home directory as `~`. That saves some space, and you can still copy and paste the path to open it, at least on Unix.\r\n\r\nI'm not convinced on `$STDLIB`, `$SITE-PACKAGES`, etc. I don't really like the separate delimited block at the top explaining variables. I don't like the $SUGGESTION that these are environment variables or shell variables. And both the standard library and `site-packages` can be in multiple locations (e.g. virtualenvs, Debian's `dist-packages` directories), so the simplifications won't work consistently.\r\n\r\n> @takluyver I feel like you will be opinionated on this one.\r\n\r\nIt's like you know me! :stuck_out_tongue: \r\n\r\n## Counterproposal\r\n\r\nWhat makes the line so long is having the path and the function signature in one line. From your example, `histogram(a, bins, range, normed, weights, density)` is already 51 characters, so with the ` in `, you only have 25 characters for the path before you hit 80 columns. What about putting them on separate lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\n~/anaconda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/numpy/lib/function_base.py\r\n  in histogram(a, bins, range, normed, weights, density)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere the first line is only 65 characters.\r\n\r\nWe could either do this on every frame (simple and consistent), or only where the single line would exceed some length (so `foo.py in bar()` would still be on one line)."

    "body": "Yeah, I though about a large refactoring of traceback, you can even omit the filename if two consecutive frames have the same file, and I don't want to go this route (for now), counting line length with current architecture would be a pain.\r\n\r\nI've push a simpler commit that just `compress_user`, and I'm fine delaying any other refactoring for later.
