    "body": "Bizarrely enough, the fact that it doesn't show the `config changed` means it _did_ load the config from your file, because the config changed message is logged at debug level after loading the file, which is suppressed by your configuration change.  For instance, if you set the level to 10 in the config file and _don't_ set `--debug`, you should see the `config changed` message after loading the file.  Note that command-line config has the highest priority, so if you set the log level on the command line _and_ the config file, the command-line option takes precedence. Because of how the precedence is implemented, however, the config file value will have effect for a short period of time between loading the file and prioritizing the CLI values.\n\nThe default log level is in fact INFO/20, so what level are you trying to change it to? Several of the messages you show in the example output are indeed info-level messages, so I'm not sure if anything's going wrong here.\n"

    "body": "Hi @minrk,\n\nIt seems to me that there is a distinction between the logging in the terminal where the notebook server is being run, and the logging in the notebook itself. In the former, we do see info messages, but in the latter we do not, even if we set the log level to info in the config files. I am only concerned with what is happening in the notebook. \n\nAlso, it is not true that the default level is info. From the IPython docs (http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/config/options/index.html), we have:\n\n```\nTerminalIPythonApp.log_level : 0|10|20|30|40|50|’DEBUG’|’INFO’|’WARN’|’ERROR’|’CRITICAL’\nDefault: 30\n```\n\n```\nIPKernelApp.log_level : 0|10|20|30|40|50|’DEBUG’|’INFO’|’WARN’|’ERROR’|’CRITICAL’\nDefault: 30\n```\n\n```\nNotebookApp.log_level : 0|10|20|30|40|50|’DEBUG’|’INFO’|’WARN’|’ERROR’|’CRITICAL’\nDefault: 30\n```\n\nI have set _all_ of these in the appropriate config files to 20/INFO, and I still get no info messages in the notebook. Additionally, we find, again in the notebook:\n\n``` python\nimport logging\nlogging.getLogger().getEffectiveLevel()\n```\n\ngives 30, e.g. WARNING. \n\nThis is also possibly relevant: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24259952/logging-module-does-not-print-in-ipython\n"
