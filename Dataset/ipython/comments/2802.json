    "body": "> I think the selection of the JSON handler should be explicit and not\n> guessed using a validator or otherwise.\n\nA note of caution: strongly coupling the Javascript front-end and the Python backend implies the potential for version skew between between Javascript and Python. Both languages are packaged and deployed differently and so strongly coupling this interface means subjugating the packaging framework in one or both, for your purposes.\n\nThe guarantee you are trying to provide is that an installed plugin's Javascript will always be compatible with the installed Python. While at first glance this guarantee seems easy to provide, it may break if a javascript developer tries to include an external dependency that is hosted online.\n\nBy making the coupling loose so that the Python and Javascript packaging mechanisms can vary independently, you avoid a number of packaging problems. A Python plugin is as simple a a normal python package that converts an object into some form of Json. A Javascript plugin can be installed by passing a URL to the notebook.\n\nJust my $0.02 :)\n"

I realize\nthe name \"output\" has some limiting connotations, but please look past\nthat.  The input area is where you tell, in code, how you want to interact\nwith the kernel.

I think there is a place for having convenient ways to input things with richer controls than text, but I feel pretty strongly that the input widgets should always be backed by straight text, and it should be easy to flip back and forth between the text and the richer representation of input. I can see a lot of value in quickly using an html table widget to enter in a nested list, for example, if only to make it trivial to get the columns and alignment right.  I think of the widgets as help for writing text that may be error-prone or fruitfully represented in some other way.\n\nThat said, right now everything I'm doing in this is in the exploratory, lets-see-how-it-feels phase.\n"

The correspondence between the graphical state and the text state can be emphasized by a quick toggle back and forth.\n\nIn a more complicated case, the widget could store its state as, say, a json message in the code.  In my prototype, I'm experimenting with having a widget store its state like this in the input: `⫷{\"widget\":\"table\",\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\"],[\"3\",\"4\"]]}⫸`.  When the code is executed, the delimiters are recognized by a preparser that then calls a handler, which transforms the json widget message into normal text code, as if it had been typed in.  If we were exporting, that text code could be substituted right in.  Or the exporter could directly parse the widget json message and provide a different representation.\n\nAgain, I'm still playing with these ideas.  Certainly the first idea above is lower impact, and would not affect exporting at all.\n\nWhy is an output-area widget not what I want?  I just want an easy way to type long tedious code _in_.\n"

    "body": "But there is a slippery slope. The example you give is pure input, but you don't have to think very far before you get ideas about things that don't have simple mapping to input code.  That is what I want to avoid - I don't want to get people getting used to the idea that input actually means \"all sorts of cool widgets.\"\n\nThere is another problems with having javascript plugins that are triggers on input alone.  For security reasons we are moving to a model where user triggered JS code is only run on cell output, never on notebook load or input related actions.  Allowing arbitrary widgets in the input area breaks that abstraction in a way that I don't think we can live with.  From this perspective, the output area is also a sort of JS sandbox (not literally though) where we tell users that aribtrary JS code can run.\n"

    "body": "I guess it's all a slope from where you stand :).  I have a requirement of mapping to input code or at the very least a json representation that can be transformed to input code, and I don't think it's hard to draw the line there.  I think that line is just as clear as \"each letter must be hand-typed\".\n\nAs for the javascript issue, I still think there is a place for a limited number of officially supported widgets that really are timesavers or really helpful.  Like using a table to represent a nested list, for example.  Or we could make input widgets not turned on by default, but a toggle would turn them on, individually or all at once.  Or you'd have to install some extension (i.e., take some overt action) in order to load the input widget code; otherwise, you'd by default see the text representation.  \n\nI'll be thinking about the security issues as I experiment.\n"

    "body": "I am also keenly interested in the way such a notebook will be converted to other formats, and I've already been a great beneficiary of the `nbconvert --format reveal` method.  To explore this a little bit, I took the notebook I linked to above, swapped the javascript in cell [7] for html with `<script>` tags, and converted with nbconvert-reveal.  The results were not expected, but perhaps something along the lines of what @ellisonbg wants after all:\n\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/51236/426919/2b20d88c-add6-11e2-8fc9-05e71d644816.png)\n\nIt even has some of the interactivity working (hover works, click has a reasonable reference error).\n\nI think you also asked why I want my output in a special div that doesn't scroll.  The answer is that I'm trying to make an interface for users with a range of expertise.  Some people (novice users) will want to point-and-click to interact with a tool, while others will want to do everything from the command line.  I hope that having these linked in the same tool will facilitate turning novice users into experts. Since the novice interface should always be available, I don't want it scrolling away as the notebook fills up with cells.  But since I want to turn novices into experts, I want them to see the python equivalent of a GUI click.  This also gives them a history of their session, suitable for converting to static html, pdf, printing-out-and-stapling-into-lab-book, etc.\n\nPerhaps I'm straying too far from the issue of topic, but this may be an appropriate place to collect JS plugin use cases.  My apologies if not.\n"
