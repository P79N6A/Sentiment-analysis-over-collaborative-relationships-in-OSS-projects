    "body": "I know you've spent a fair bit of time on this, but I think it's just far too big a change to make and review all in one go. Sorry! I think we need to break it down into a sequence of smaller steps:\n- Add pygments terminal-colouring machinery\n- One by one, convert the pieces that produce coloured output to the new machinery (oinspect, ultratb, debugger...)\n- When there's nothing left using it, remove the old colouring machinery (coloransi, PyColorize, etc.)\n\nWherever possible, we should always approach significant transitions like this. I'm doing something similar with prompt_toolkit: add the new code, switch over to it, remove the old. PRs like this are just too much to handle in one go.\n\nSo even though I feel mean saying this, I think we should close this PR and pull the changes apart into a set of smaller PRs. I'm happy to help with that process if you want.\n"
