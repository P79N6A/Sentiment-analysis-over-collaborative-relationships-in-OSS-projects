    "body": "Guys, I can see the fix in ipdb, but it tests against nose having been loaded and when I'm running ipython notebooks nose modules _are_ in fact loaded, so the output still redirects to the console in which the notebook is running rather than the notebook itself. I've commented out the fix locally (where the code runs the test 'if 'nose' in sys.modules.keys():' prior to defining io.stdout so that io.stdout is not redefined:\n\n``` python\nif 'nose' in sys.modules.keys():\n        def update_stdout():\n            # setup stdout to ensure output is available with nose\n            # io.stdout = sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__\n            pass\n```\n\nThis does work in my local installation, but likely causes issues with nose tests, which was the initial source of this particular bug. I could very well be doing something wrong with ipython on my end, it's a stock installation via brew on yosemite, using the latest ipython and ipdb code installed via pip.\n"
