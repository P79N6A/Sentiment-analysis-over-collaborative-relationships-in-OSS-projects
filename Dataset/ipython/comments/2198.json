But before we merge it, let's just do a bit more polish on `git-mpr` while we're at it:\n- In help string, I'd change\n\n```\nMerge (one|many) github pull request by their number. If pull request can't be\nmerge as is, cancel merge, and continue to the next if any.\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nMerge one or more github pull requests by their number. If any one pull request can't be\nmerged as is, its merge is ignored and the process continues with the next ones (if any).\n```\n- Why is `-m` needed at all?  It seems to me that should be the default behavior, there's no reason why a flag should be needed for the most common use case.\n"
