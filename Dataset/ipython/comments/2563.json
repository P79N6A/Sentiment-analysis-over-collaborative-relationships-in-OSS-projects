However, I think I'll implement the check with a try-except, because other functions (such as `check_security_dir()`) already use this approach. Theoretically, there could be a very bizarre case, where `src` exists but it is not readable.\n\nGood to know that the profile directory is a must, thanks.\n"

The profile directory often does.
