    "body": "The contents API should now be much more consistent. Questions that came up while I was doing this:\n- Parameter names for callbacks: I preserved the relatively verbose `success_callback`/`error_callback`, but moved them into options, so that verbosity is more annoying now. Alternatives include jQuery's success/error, or callback/errback as I've seen in some places.\n- What to do in callbacks: some of the callbacks just trigger a 'foo.Contents' event, which is then hooked up to do the real work. I can see possible benefits of this, but it mostly feels like an unnecessary layer of indirection. I'd be inclined to call continuation methods directly, and have them trigger appropriate events. In some cases, errors may be an exception to that, if the only thing that makes sense is notifying the user somehow. Also, should the events be under `.Contents`, or under the components that call them?\n"

    "body": "@Carreau The canonical way to use the Drive API, is to have user actions trigger changes in the data model, which then trigger changes in the view/controller.  For example, adding a new cell results in a call the the Google Drive API to create a new cell in the data model.  This the triggers an event, which the vew/controller listen for, and respond to by creating a new cell.\n\nThe advantage of this approach is it treats local and remote events consistently, and guarantees that the app is based on exactly the same model as Google Drive's (local) data model.\n\nThe only exception to this is text boxes.  There are a number of ways to handle an interactive text box, we can discuss in more detail when we start working on that part.\n"

    "body": "@takluyver I will take a closer look at the code, but my approach has been to use callbacks for functions that are requests for data, and events for everything else.\n\nE.g. I would use a callback for loading a file, or listing contents of a directory, but events for saving.  The rationale is that if you aren't doing anything specific with the results of a function, there's no reason for the caller to specify a callback.  E.g. failed saves could be directly listened for by some error displaying UI code.\n"

From my point of view, I consider this to be \"reviewed\".  I can go over it once more to make sure there aren't any more bugs.  There are some more changes I would like to make, (like returning objects instead of strings in checkpointing functions) but they don't have to be done in this PR if you are in a hurry.\n"
