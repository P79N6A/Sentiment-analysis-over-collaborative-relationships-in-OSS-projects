It goes from completely unusable to essentially unusable. I don't think this PR will actually allow users to start using the notebook regularly on phones.\n- It is very likely that after 3.0 we will be rethinking our entire approach to menus.\n- The real answer to to build an actual mobile focused app that uses mobile friendly UI elements.\n\nUnless there is a strong objection, I would like to close the PR.\n"

    "body": "No complaint with closing this: I just wanted to throw something out that solved #6759 with as little change as possible.\n\nI agree generally that submenus in the design are somewhat tenuous...  ionic doesn't support them officially, either. polymer/paper on the other hand, [still has submenus](http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/menus.html#menus-usage). what did you have in mind? a big side tray? The number of menus, and what they actually give you (say, View/Insert vs Edit/Cell), seems less than ideal... by the same token, we hardly want to end up with the eclipse wall-to-wall-tiny-buttons, which isn't going to be any better on mobile.\n\nIn the mobile and broader, responsive design: I really like what polymer is doing... heck, I even think material design would be a good fit for a lot of the notebook concepts: cells feel very like cards, and could have output slide out from underneath when executed. i would love an enhance cell bar, with metadata and [extra authoring tools](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/6834) to stick to the frame of the active cell (which edge, is another story), with a bigger, clearer \"run\" button out near the corner.\n\nAdditionally, I like the polymer [vulcanizing](https://github.com/Polymer/vulcanize) process, by which all of the assets for a piece of the UI is encapsulated in a single HTML file... html template, javascript, and css. Ractive has a [similar concept](https://github.com/ractivejs/component-spec).  Adopting something like that would reduce the number of `$('<tag/>')`.\n\nI trust there is a better place for this kind of discussion... is this kind of dialogue happening somewhere?\n"

The Galileo vignette is fantastic inspiration, from hypothesis to instrumentation to publication to reproducibility... but obviously we have new challenges, as well. How do we capture hypotheses? What are our instruments? What is publication?\n\n> and we try as much as possible to push this the other way around by having no style at all in js or js config.\n\nI guess i liked the self-contained modularity, thinking from the point of view of an extension writer (this is still not easy), but can see how from a core perspective this would be less desirable.\n\nI agree with the sentiment of separating the logic and presentation... but in practice there is a great deal of DOM and CSS manipulation occurring in the notebook app js, as per my previous point about `$(\"<tag/>\")` injection.\n\nWhile some of this is unavoidable (have to tell CodeMirror, after all, to which node to attach) it seems like this work can be shifted elsewhere:\n- adopting _something_ which has an evented data model for the core notebook app concepts (Cell, Notebook, etc)\n  - backbone (already invested), react (beautiful model, crazy jsx source), etc.\n    - this cleans up the giant pile of undocumentation that is `ipython.events`\n      - at this point one _could_ start just using templates, which would drastically reduce the amount of dom/css manipulation, but...\n- adopting _something_ that can turn that model _efficiently_ into DOM\n  - react, but also ractive\n- much heavier use of the CSS preprocessor, enabling a richer design language [without being \"stuck\"](https://coderwall.com/p/wixovg/bootstrap-without-all-the-debt) with the stock language\n"

    "body": "> I'm interested in how you think the notebook format would have to change for react... my understanding is that it does very little to structure your data, just demand that it is immutable, while state (which is mutable) handles what the UI actually shows.\n\nI was speaking of the implementation. In the current one each object get serialized to json at save, so there is no notion of 'state' beyond the object themselves. Moreover some object carried their own state in weird way. I probably seeing a bit further that pure react, like live colaboration. But currently the current ly shown celltoolbar is store in the notebook. Does that mean that 2 persons cannot show 2 different toolbars ?\n\n> I was talking, specifically, for mobile interaction design where a redesign was mentioned earlier.\n> ... \n\nI still don't  think we want to couple appearance with JS. I understand what Google does with Paper. \nANd I think that the view on mobile jour just remove most of possibility to edit code. On mobile you mostly will read and interact with widgets. bUt we are not there yet anyway.\n\nFor the last part I agree that we should have a full js implementation that works without DOM and only reflect the state of the document. Unfortunately that was not possible when we started coding the notebook, and this not seem to be an idea that other people seem to share.\n"
