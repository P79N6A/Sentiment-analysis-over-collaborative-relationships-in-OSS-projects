    "body": "Thanks, good catch. I had to clean up the javascript a bit, because some of it was inappropriate.\n\nYou should never actually call the prototype functions, and never pass an object to its own methods, and (almost) never need to pass any of its attributes to its own methods.\n\nThat's like calling a method of a class rather than the method of an instance:\n\n```\nCell.prototype.method(that)\n```\n\nshould just be:\n\n```\nthat.method()\n```\n\nIt's like doing:\n\n```\ncell = Cell()\nClass.method(cell)\n```\n\ninstead of just:\n\n```\ncell.method()\n```\n\nSee fbed9d115628f42fad34beb0a5256975f76f20fd for the relevant changes.\n"
