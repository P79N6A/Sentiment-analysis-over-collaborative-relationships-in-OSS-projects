    "body": "Hard to tell exactly what's happening, but here's one thought:\n\nWith IPython 1.x, if an HTML representation fails, it fails silently (which causes figures to just not show up).  If you're using mpld3 0.1, you may have hit one of the many corner cases that is not yet supported, which could lead to an exception which IPython silently suppresses, and result in a plot just not showing up.\n\nI believe that this silent suppression of html-rep exceptions has been fixed in IPython 2.0\n"

Inline figures in the notebook use:\n\n```\nimport io\nbuf = io.BytesIO()\nfig.canvas.print_figure(buf, format='png')\ndata = buf.getvalue()\n```\n\nThe vast majority of figures that fail to display are the result of that `print_figure` call failing with some exception. `savefig` is often the easiest way to exercise the same code, once you have a figure that is failing to display.\n\nIPython 2.0 will be out next week. But you can install the release candidate with:\n\n```\npip install --pre --find-links http://archive.ipython.org/testing/2.0.0 ipython\n```\n"
