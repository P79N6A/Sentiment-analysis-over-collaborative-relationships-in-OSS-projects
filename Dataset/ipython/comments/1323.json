    "body": "I played around with this a bit, and it looks like the problem is that my expectations are too high for Python 2. In a cmd console, the code page is 850, and I cannot type Korean text. The following script raises a unicode error when I try to run it from within a cmd console, for example\n\n```\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nprint u\"안녕하세요!\"\n```\n\nThe qtconsole does handle the unicode literal case well, however:\n\n```\nIn [5]: print u\"안녕하세요!\"\n안녕하세요!\n```\n\nSo, what would be ideal is if unicode characters in a non-unicode string had thrown an exception when I tried to run it. This is outside the scope of IPython, though, so I'll just close the issue.\n"

    "body": "> So, what would be ideal is if unicode characters in a non-unicode string had thrown an exception when I tried to run it\n\nPrecisely the behaviour in Python 3 ;-):\n\n```\nIn [1]: print b\"안녕하세요!\"\n  File \"<ipython-input-1-f786c14fbc8f>\", line 1\n    print b\"안녕하세요!\"\n\n^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n```\n\nI think we should be able to handle this correctly. What you see is the result of encoding text in UTF-8 and decoding it as \ncp1252. It's a pain to get right in the terminal, but the Qt console should be fully unicode aware. We spent a while trying to resolve this sort of issue, but apparently we missed something (most of the core developers use Linux or Mac, so the testing on Windows machines is less rigorous).\n\nI'll reopen this, but set it to low priority, because it's quite complicated, and you can use unicode strings to get the correct output. @jstenar is our regular unicode-on-Windows tester, so he might want to investigate.\n"
