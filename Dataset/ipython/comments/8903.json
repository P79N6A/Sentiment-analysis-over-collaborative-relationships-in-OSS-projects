    "body": "The trouble is that `func` there is _not_ in the local namespace. `new_func` is a closure over `func`, and closures work in a bit of an odd way. `exec()` gets the global interactive namespace (where `wraps`, `logger` and `add` go in your example), and the local namespace of the function that called timeit (containing `args` and `kwargs`), but it doesn't get the namespace from `logger`, where `func` and `new_func` live.\n\nThis issue comes up periodically in some form or another, and we haven't really found a solution. It seems to be a limitation of Python. You'll need to adapt your code so `%timeit` doesn't see any closed-over variables. This might be as simple as doing:\n\n``` python\nfunc2 = func\nresult = %timeit -q -o func2(*args, **kwargs)\n```\n\n(Also, note that `result` will be the result of timeit, not the result of your function)\n"
