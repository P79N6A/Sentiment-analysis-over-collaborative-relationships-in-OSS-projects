If required, I can rebase/stash/split the commits in this PR while it's just an experimental branch (perhaps to have a separate PR for the MappingProxyType update, or to join the `.travis.yml` updates into a single commit).\n\nFor older PyPy (Python 2.7) versions (e.g. v4.0.1), this PR has more failures, including some in `test_pretty.py`. I'm using PyPy v5.3.1 (the last stable release) but Travis CI still has the v2.5.0 version, which isn't even the last v2.x version, so I've add a PyPy installation to `.travis.yml` to ensure the results in Travis CI are the same I get here, or at least as similar as possible.\n\nAs of today, the last stable PyPy versions are v2.6.1, v4.0.1 and v5.3.1. The last PyPy3 versions are v2.4.0 (a Python 3.2 that allows u-prefixed unicode strings) and v5.2.0-alpha1 (Python 3.3), but this PR is only about PyPy, not PyPy3.\n"

I was trying to fix these, where to test in a specific PyPy version here I was using a prepared docker image: https://hub.docker.com/r/library/pypy/\n\nOne of such failures is easy to fix (the `collections.defaultdict.__module__` is `\"_collections\"`, so the deferred printers list just need to include a printer to `(\"_collections\", \"defaultdict\")`. But the other failure would require some deeper changes, as `super()` objects didn't have the `__thisclass__` attribute in older PyPy versions: https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy/issues/2251\n"
