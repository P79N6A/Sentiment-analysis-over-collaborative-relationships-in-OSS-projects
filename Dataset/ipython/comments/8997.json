    "body": "The better solution is to fix the permissions so that Jupyter can run in your regular user account. It's hard to give precise instructions for this, because there are different things that can go wrong and cause similar errors. But in general, you will want to do something like this:\r\n\r\n1. Look at the 'Permission denied' error message you're getting, and see what file it refers to. If this is under your home directory (`/home/username` on Linux, or `/Users/username` on Mac), these instructions apply. If it's somewhere else, the problem might be different.\r\n2. Open a terminal, and `cd` to the folder containing that file.\r\n3. Run `ls -l` to see all the files there. If the file is there, you'll probably see that its owner is `root`, instead of your own username. This is the most common problem. If the file is not there, it probably can't create it - go up a level and try the same thing on the directory.\r\n4. Run `sudo chown username:username filename` to change the owner (and group) of the file to your own user. If you're doing this on a directory, use the `-R` flag to also change all the files inside it.\r\n\r\nYou can also probably do this from a file manager, but there are loads of different ones, so we won't give instructions."
