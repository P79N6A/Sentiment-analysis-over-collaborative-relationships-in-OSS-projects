His panel is _today_ and I caught wind of it a few days ago by accident, so over twitter I helped him write both a %%cython and a _parallel_ %%cython version of a Gibbs sampler so he could demonstrate it at the R conference.  I think the panel is more or less happening right now, I'm very curious to hear how it all goes aftewards :)\n\nTiming the parallel cython runs was also what led to #1923, so we can now very easily time parallel magic cells.  Async results already have all the tools for it, but with this, it looks _extremely_ simple, which is great for demos and examples.\n"
