    "body": "Another data point:\n\nThe scenario I described above, and the test transcript I included, were on a Snake Charmer VM with 16 vCPUs. That is, I did this\n\n```\nexport CHARMER_CPUS=16\n```\n\nbefore spinning it up. (Also `CHARMER_RAM=8000`.) I didn't think to include this info in the OP as it didn't seem relevant.\n\nI recently retried on a fresh VM with only 12 vCPUs, and **all of the tests passed** -- not as much as a warning anywhere.\n\nFrom my point of view I'm happy to consider this closed, as my top priority is getting tests passing in Snake Charmer, which this has achieved :-) ... But if you would rather leave it open, since it suggests something a bit wrong in IPython.parallel, no complaints from me.\n"
