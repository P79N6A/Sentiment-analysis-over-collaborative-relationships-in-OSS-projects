    "body": "Yup - we just need to figure out the best balance of brokenness - it may well be that the consensus is that we shouldn't move to pyrepl (yet, at least), but having closed #2895 I wanted to propose an alternate approach.  I imagine adding INPUTRC support to pyrepl shouldn't be too hard, and is on pyrepl's todo list.  At the very least, it supports default emacs and vim modes, and you _can_ customize it fully, it just doesn't parse readline's inputrc yet.  It might be that exposing pyrepl config via IPython is the best option right now.\n\nat this point:\n- Pro pyrepl: works without shenanigans on OS X, SIGINT during reverse-i search isn't broken\n- Pro readline: parses INPUTRC\n\nIt could be that pyrepl isn't especially well behaved, and is just not in a usable state right now, but I haven't used it enough to know.\n"

Here's a simple test: type a line that is so long it needs to continue to the next line. Already here it's pretty broken! It continues onto the next line but indented totally wrong. Now hit backspace to go back to the previous line. Now it prints the prompt in the wrong place. Typing until you gets to the third line is even weirder and more broken still :( (I tested this also with the branch this PR references and it's the same there as in the tests I made on pyrepl itself before.)\n\nDon't you guys get this behavior?\n"
