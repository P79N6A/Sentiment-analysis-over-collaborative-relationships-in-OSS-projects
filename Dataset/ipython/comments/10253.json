The GeoJSON class isn't an\nupdate to the display protocol. It is just a new class that a bunch of us\nare needing/using across different frontends. We already have common\ndisplay classes for JSON, HTML, Image, etc. - this is yet another one of\nthose. We are putting the more specialized ones (Vega, Plotly) in their\nrespective libraries (altair, plotly, etc.).\n\nThen you can \"just\" update/publish an ipython-geosjon, ipython-vegalite,\n> ipython-mp3 , ipython-pdf , ipython-midi ... and have IPython auto discover\n> these.\n>\nAhh, OK I think I am understanding. This would allow third party developers\nto put things under the IPython.display namespace, while shipping things\nseparately. Is this entry point already in place?\n\nFor things like Vega/Plotly that (the entry point) makes sense, but for the\nGeoJSON case 1) it is a very common standard and 2) there isn't a python\npackage for us to put it in - it is literally just that class. Grant, Kyle\nand I thought that putting it directly into IPython made the most sense.\n\nThen in case of updates needed, a new release of IPython is not necessary.\n>\nGot it!\n\n\n\n> â€”\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/10253#issuecomment-278140533>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AABr0HZaGawmAkRZBDSJlAy6O4dAxAgmks5raN11gaJpZM4L51yg>\n> .\n>\n\n\n\n-- \nBrian E.
