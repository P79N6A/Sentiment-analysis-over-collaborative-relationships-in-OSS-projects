The reason is that we would like to be able to do tab _substitution_, not just replacement, e.g. replace `\\alpha<tab>` with `α` (see JuliaLang/julia#6340).\n\nI'm not a big fan of magic undocumented metadata (e.g. the `matches_extra` field) in the message spec.  If you need a magic undocumented back channel, can't the kernel just stuff extra JSON fields into the message which can be ignored by the front-end?\n"

The reason is that we would like to be able to do tab substitution, not just replacement, e.g. replace \\alpha<tab> with α (see JuliaLang/julia#6340).\n\nMakes sense. Currently, the reply contains `matched_text` and matches, from which you can infer the replacements, but perhaps it makes more sense to include the cursor position(s) explicitly in the reply, rather than the text. How about this for the reply:\n\ngiven:\n\n```\nx = \\alpha<tab>\n012345678901234\n```\n\nrequest:\n\n`````` python\n{\n  \"code\" : \"x = \\\\alpha\",\n  \"col\" : 10,\n  \"lineno\" : 0,\n}\n\nreply:\n\n```python\n{\n  \"matches\" : [ \"α\" ],\n  \"start_col\" : 4,\n  \"end_col\" : 10,\n  \"start_lineno\" : 0,\n  \"end_lineno\" : 0,\n}\n``````\n\nconveying the cursor range to select. If we don't want to allow multi-line replacements, we could have just `lineno`, `col`, and `length`.\n\n> I'm not a big fan of magic undocumented metadata\n\nThe proposal has been for simple categorical matches, such as files, attributes, arguments. Originally, this was proposed as allowing `matches` to be a dict. IHaskell does some things to add further hints, for which a simple dict wouldn't help. We could back off from this change if we don't come up with a decent use case.\n\n> payloads\n\narg, yes. payloads are mostly undocumented, and mostly horrible, as well. I will draft some documentation on how they work now. I really don't like how they work, but I haven't figured out a better alternative, yet.\n\n> I think Min has implemented the latter at present, but we didn't have a strong opinion.\n\nI implemented both - absolute offset first, then switched to line & col. I mainly did this because it's marginally easier to convert line & col to offset (CodeMirror wants line & col, kernel probably wants offset) than it is to convert the other direction. Plus, I would have to implement the other conversion in javascript, which I always like to avoid.  It's not a strong preference, but that's where it is right now.\n"

There are multiple ways to terminate \"lines\", and \"columns\" could mean bytes, characters, or glyphs.)\n\nRaw offsets will also shorten and simplify the messages, since you replace two fields with one.\n\nI see the difficulty with CodeMirror, although it is a bit annoying to complicate the message spec over this.  I don't suppose CodeMirror can be patched to accept raw offsets?   Or does CodeMirror use an array of lines internally?    Why does the conversion need to be done in Javascript?\n\nWe can certainly do whatever conversion is necessary in the end, of course, as long as things are sufficiently well documented to resolve the ambiguities above.\n"

    "body": "Thanks for pinging me for feedback; sorry it's taken me a while to take a look, but I really love all these changes. Pretty much all of them seem like good ideas from IHaskell's point of view. I especially like the addition of a `priority` list for the `display_data` messages and using the `display_data`-style API elsewhere.\n\nI had a few questions/concerns, which I've tallied here. My questions about `object_info_reply` aren't as well thought out as I'd like, so maybe you all have some ideas about how I should be using it and such.\n\n### `matched_extra`:\n- `matched_extra` is fairly ambiguous about how it's used and how it'll be displayed. Here's what I want to be able to do. I want each autocompletion reply to have in it a few fields:\n  - Type signatures for autocompleted items\n  - The package name for each item\n  - The module name for each item\n\nI also want for each of these to be styled in my own way, so I'd really like to just return HTML associated with each match. Or something like that - basically, I'd like a bit more control over how these things are displayed, and be able to style them (color, font, etc). This could also be accomplished via `custom.js` or `custom.css` somehow. For instance, I could provide keys for each of these corresponding to CSS class names, so for each autocomplete response I'd have a dict that has some attributes; e.g. `matched_extra` would be a list of dicts, where the keys were the CSS classes to apply. So if it were `matched_extra = [{\"module\": \"Data.Hello\"}]`, then I would want the text \"Data.Hello\" to show up in the autocomplete styled with some class along the lines of `autocomplete-module` which I could stick in `custom.css`. (This is just an idea for how to implement what I want; I have no idea how this might fit into the overall architecture.)\n\n### `object_info_reply`:\n- I definitely agree about removing the existing structure and leaving it more up to the kernel and using the `display_data` style interface. I have no real concerns or problems with the new spec, so what follows next is just some questions/thoughts about `object_info_request` as a whole; it's something I've had some questions and issues dealing with even in the previous version of the spec.\n- Where is `object_info_request` used other than when you type things like `a?` or `a??`?\n- How do you decide when `object_info_request` is used? Can that be modified via `custom.js` somehow? In particular, Haskell allows the following code:\n\n``` haskell\n-- Declare ? and ?? as operators that are just + and *\n(?) :: Int -> Int -> Int\na ? b = a + b\n\n(??) :: Int -> Int -> Int\na ?? b = a * b\n\n-- I want a type error or a syntax error, probably?\na ?\nb ??\n```\n\nBasically, I'm not sure how `object_info_request` can work in a language-agnostic way, and it might be nice to have some clarification about how this info is requested. I think it's also called after a '(' in IPython, which IHaskell changes to a space.\n- Also, what is the \"name\" field of the object? e.g. can I request info about the result of an operation, such as:\n\n``` haskell\na + b? -- using IPython ? syntax, which is a bit strange\n```\n\nShould \"name\" then be \"a + b\"?\n\nAll of these may be a bit redundant for IHaskell, as I have things like `:doc` and `:hoogle` and `:info` for requesting special types of information about expressions and identifiers. \n\nThanks for all the hard work, by the way! I'm really happy to see so much focus on including other language kernels and providing a clean API. I'm very glad you guys seem to be willing to tackle and pay off technical debt incurred from previous versions.\n"

IPython isn't going to handle this at all, so it will be up to custom js to interpret the extra info (e.g. IHaskell html completion display). I don't think it's feasible to make something generic that IHaskell can use without any custom js.\n- remove `name`from object_info_reply, since it may not be meaningful.\n- rename object_info to inspect, since it's not necessarily inspecting a single object.\n"

Any such logic will be handled by custom js that would override a method on the Completer (I'm not sure which, and the API may need to be changed a little to allow this).  The idea behind metadata is that you would write your own information there (e.g. in metadata.ihaskell_extra_data), and it is entirely up to you to write the js that interprets that.
