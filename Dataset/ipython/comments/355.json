    "body": "There's threading code in there, but honestly it doesn't bother me at all.  As we discussed on IRC, this is precisely the kind of scenario where threads make sense (hiding latencies introduced by i/o from the user experience), and that _every_ modern program with a non-trivial UI must use.\n\nYour implementation looks great, it's very clean, and thanks to Python now offering locks as context managers, it's actually very readable and easy to inspect.  Part of the nastiness of lock handling was even seeing that you were doing the right thing in the code, and context managers really help a lot with that.\n\nI ran all tests and inspected the code, it looks very good to me.  Some more discussion on irc...\n"
