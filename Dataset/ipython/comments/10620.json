    "body": "The idea of dozens of people unfamiliar with the project each getting a random issue emailed to them every day with an invitation to try and fix it does not exactly fill me with joy, as I sit here trying to go through my inbox with ~40 issues updated overnight.\r\n\r\nIf this service has value to us, I think it would be as a kind of new contributor stress test - forcing us to change the ways we work so that new contributors can get started more easily. \r\n\r\nI'd be concerned about dredging up old issues, if it really is selecting them at random. I think it's not unusual for 'would be nice' issues to linger because there isn't much demand for a feature, and it may be tricky to implement without either breaking something else or making deeper changes to the architecture. If new users try to tackle these, I could see it requiring lots of communication for relatively little tangible benefit."
