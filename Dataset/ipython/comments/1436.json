    "body": "I dug deeper into the badness, here is some more insight based on the sample output below.\n- Behavior of ipython-qtconsole.exe and \"pythonw ipython-qtconsole-script.pyw\" is very unhelpful. It assumes users will see the message printed to the console. They will not, and just assume ipython has poor quality standards. ;) If IPython detected it was run with pythonw, it could pop up a message box instead of printing to the console in this case. This is also important for the case where dependencies like pyside/pyqt are not installed.\n- Why does the ipython-qtconsole not support the --gui option? This is an option for the kernel, not the qtconsole itself, and works fine once \n  you're in.\n\n```\nC:\\>python \"C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\ipython-qtconsole-script.pyw\" --gui qt\nIPython: an enhanced interactive Python shell.\n\nOptions\n-------\n<SNIP>\nTo see all available configurables, use `--help-all`\n\n[IPKernelApp] Bad config encountered during initialization:\n[IPKernelApp] Unrecognized flag: '--gui'\n<HANG>\n```\n"

    "body": "See #1426 for the `--gui` issue. I think this issue is originally just that, so I'll close it as a duplicate - you might want to open a new issue for the behaviour with pythonw.\n\nAside: hurrah, another Windows tester ;-). The core developers mostly use Linux or Macs, so Windows support sometimes doesn't get as much attention.\n"
