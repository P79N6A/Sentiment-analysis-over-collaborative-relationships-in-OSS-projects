Then it makes sens to have a icon that indicates to you that the file is 'cloud related'. \n\nThat make me think, I don't now what the plan are for the notebook, but we might considere having a small separate package from IPython, that just take notebook credential (store it in keychain etc) and when double clicking upload the file to a remote notebook, and open the notebook in the browser.

Increasingly, I can upload any file to the cloud and work on it. Should .odt files have a cloud symbol because I can use them in Google Docs? And it's also common to use a notebook file purely on your local machine, which makes the cloud symbol somewhat confusing.\n\nIcon themes: Sorry, I just meant do we want to have different icons for the major platforms? They'd have the same elements but with subtle differences so they blend in. Anyway, we can worry about that once we've got a good design.\n\nInvolvement of 'code' in the icon: Plenty of files can include images/plots, though. .doc can do that. What makes ipynb special is that it combines that with code that you can run.\n\nIP[y]/Nb - not bad! Could we try it with the two parts more equal in size? How about the Nb in blue&yellow?

    "body": "> Not quite sure I understand when translating (is this how is called the small folded corner ?), It is common metaphor to distinguish document files from other types of files.\n\nAn important part of the text in the notebook logo is that the tail of the 'y' aligns with the baseline of the text, and does not dip (significantly) below.  The text in these icons, on the other hand, has a curvy y, which dips well below the baseline.\n\nCompare your icon:\n\n![icon](http://i.imgur.com/WmJOg.png)\n\nwith the relevant section in the notebook:\n\n![notebook](http://imgur.com/TIGEt.png)\n\nI will concede that the Droid Sans Mono font we use for the current notebook logo is a pretty ugly one, but it at least has this one nice feature for our purposes.\n"
