I cant seem to get any of the logging I see in the terminal to be redirected to a file in the default profile directory: .ipython\\profile_default\\log\n\nI'm trying a variety of combinations of logging settings in: ipython_notebook_config.py\n\n``` python\n# Start logging to the default log file.\nc.ZMQInteractiveShell.logstart = True\n\n# The name of the logfile to use.\nc.ZMQInteractiveShell.logfile = r'IPythonLog.txt\n\n# Start logging to the given file in append mode.\nc.ZMQInteractiveShell.logappend = 'Path\\To\\Log.txt'\n```\n"
