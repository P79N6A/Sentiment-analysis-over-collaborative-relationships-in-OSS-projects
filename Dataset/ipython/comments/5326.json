    "body": "OK, this got a little more complicated. Instead of `dump_failure()`, there is now `print_extra_info()`. If we're running with a `-j` or `--fast` option, this is called on failure before we dump the output. Otherwise, it's called before starting the test run.\n\nHowever, that method may need info such as the locations of temporary directories. In fact, that's the motivation for adding it in the first place. Those can't be defined in launch(), because when we're not running in parallel, it's called before launch(). And they shouldn't be defined in `__init__()`, because that's called even for test groups that don't get run. So there's a new `setup()` method, called before the tests are run, but only when we know we will try to run them, in which temporary directories etc. should be created. The JS tests also use this to start the notebook server.\n"
