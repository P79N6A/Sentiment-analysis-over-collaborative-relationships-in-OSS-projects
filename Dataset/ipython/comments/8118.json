The combination of the in-browser text editor, Terminado, and the notebooks themselves has led to Jupyter/IPython working about 80% as a pure-browser interface to an analytic environment, which is awesome.  In a corporate environment with a heavy cloud focus, this is a huge boon, and file download would really fill in the gaps.  The multiple-file zip download sounds great as well.\n"

    "body": "@takluyver @minrk we're looking at something like this as well.  I'm wondering if a good first step toward this would be making the file size available to the frontend as another field in the contents spec.  That way you at least have some advanced warning if you're about to crash your browser by reading 100MB into the DOM. See also https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter_notebook/issues/24.\n"
