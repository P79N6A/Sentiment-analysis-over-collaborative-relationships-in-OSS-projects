    "body": "I think I was the last person to touch that machinery, so I'll have a look.\n\nThe issue is the brackets - we'd envisaged that you'd do `zip?`, not `zip()?` to examine the zip function. Doing `min(); zip?` works as expected. It's a valid expectation, but it might be a little tricky to do reliably with regexes - consider `foo(param=bar()?` and `foo(param=bar())?`: in the first case, we are inspecting bar, and in the second case foo, but handling nestable brackets with a regex is tricky.\n"
