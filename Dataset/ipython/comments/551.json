    "body": "As indicated, the basic idea is fine (in fact we used to have this feature in the prior config setup), but it doesn't warrant a standalone flag.\n\nFinally, it needs a test.  The test should be marked to run only if matplotlib is importable, but if so, it should create IPython instances passing them a config, both with the value set to true and false, and checking in both cases that the `user_ns` namespace in the instance either contains or doesn't contain the matplotlib `plot()` function.  We're really trying to ensure that new code improves our test coverage as we go.\n\nIt's too tight for this to make it into 0.11, but since now we hope to make quicker releases with the feedback we'll start collecting, merging this in the next few days after you have a chance to implement these changes should be fine for 0.12.\n\nThanks!\n"

    "body": "OK. Good point about the test. I will implement that and remove the flags. Maybe the alias should also be removed? \nI don't think many users want to customize this every time they start ipython with pylab.\n\nMaybe 6c423a1bfde41bf119d6 should be merged into 0.11. The import_all argument to pylab_activate doesn't do anything right now as far as I can see. It is however not a big impact as it is only relevant if a user implements code that calls pylab_activate directly since ipython otherwise always calls pylab_activate without import_all.\n"

You should probably then rebase off master and do the new part from there, in a separate PR, since the later commits don't really apply much anymore.\n\nThanks for the code!  At least the first part will now be in 0.11.\n"
