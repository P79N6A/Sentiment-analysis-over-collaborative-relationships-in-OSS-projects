    "body": "Thanks for the speedy response @takluyver. The user has cleared some space from his home directory. It also appears that it was affected by a compiler failure issue. When the python program failed to compile, the system kept all the failure logs and did not delete the temporary files generated during the compilation in the root directory (~/.theano). After deleting this folder, the issue was resolved. Thanks again!\n"
