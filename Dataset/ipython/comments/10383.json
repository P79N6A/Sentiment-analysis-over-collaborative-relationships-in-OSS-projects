    "body": "Please remove this behavior of overriding the settings in matplotlibrc. I understand that the (ugly) matplotlib defaults cause problems out of the box. However, I think the current behavior is extremely confusing for new users trying to change these defaults. For users who do not understand that `%matplotlib inline` is actually using an element of IPython (not matplotlib, not Jupyter), the path to solving this problem can be long. It took me quite a while the first time. \r\n\r\nThese default settings also seem to produce figures that are too small for modern monitors. A dpi of 72 times a 4.0\" height produces a figure less than 300 pixels high, which is a quarter the height of a 1920 x 1200 monitor, but figures rendered with these defaults always seem significantly smaller than this.\r\n\r\nI remember that in past years a line like\r\n`c.InlineBackend.rc` = {'dpi': 72, etc.}`\r\nappeared by default in one of the IPython config files. However, the current files created by `ipython profile create` make no mention of the inline backend. Searching the IPython help for \"InlineBackend\" (no space) returns no results. The top results of googling \"c.InlineBackend.rc\" are threads of people discussing this issue, e.g. [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35939989/matplotlib-configuration-for-inline-backend-in-jupyter-notebook).\r\n\r\nPossible compromise: overwrite rc settings only if the current matplotlibrc file is not in the config directory, using `mpl.matplotlib_fname().startswith(mpl.get_configdir())` or similar. This would avoid problems for totally new users but would allow people to use matplotlibrc without having to learn about IPython config and insert a mysterious line into a file that does not exist in a fresh install.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time."
