    "body": "Hi,\r\nI suspect this is the right place for this question. If not, please redirect.\r\nI understand the need to autocomplete `f_b_k` into `foo_bar_kittens` to win time for those who `import *` in the shell,\r\nbut on the other hand, the behavior I now observe is that the case sensitivity is mostly ignored on autocomplete - which is IMHO a regression which makes many people loose time.\r\ne.g.:\r\n\r\n`EXCLAM = None`\r\n\r\n`eXCLAM = None`\r\n\r\n`EX<tab>` yields `Exception, EXCLAM, eXCLAM`\r\n\r\nand `eX<tab>` yields `Exception, EXCLAM, eXCLAM, exec, exit`\r\n\r\nwhen the old and simple autocomplete would actually autocomplete to `EXCLAM` and `eXCLAM` respectively.\r\n\r\nIs that a expected behavior? If yes, how to deactivate the snake-case autocomplete?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
