    "body": "> I also realized that the API in /core/completer.py has some TODOs.\r\n\r\nNo-one in particular it would be great to get some of that done, but let's focus on unicode so far. \r\n\r\nFrom your code I see where some of the misunderstanding and issue are. \r\n\r\nCurrently in IPython, you can do `Unicode name` -> `unicode symbol`, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGREEK SMALL LETTER ETA -> η\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is done through `unicodedata.lookup`, as you discovered. \r\n\r\nIf you look carefully you will see that this is already done in `unicode_name_matches` around line 1664. \r\n\r\nOne thing we do not have though is if someone type only `GREEK SM<tab>`, we have no way to suggest `ALL LETTER ETA`, and there is no (AFAICT) simple way built-in in Python to achieve this. \r\n\r\nWe need to build this possibility ahead of time.\r\nTo do so we need to first build a list of all unicode names. First let's try to do it only for ASCII for A to Z ([65 to 90](http://ee.hawaii.edu/~tep/EE160/Book/chap4/subsection2.1.1.1.html)):\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [4]: import unicodedata\r\n   ...: names = []\r\n   ...: for c in range(65, 90):\r\n   ...:     try:\r\n   ...:         names.append(unicodedata.name(chr(c)))\r\n   ...:     except ValueError:\r\n   ...:         pass\r\n   ...: names\r\nOut[4]:\r\n['LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER B',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER F',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER G',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER H',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER J',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER K',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER L',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER M',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER N',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER O',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER P',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Q',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER R',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER S',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER U',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER V',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER W',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER X',\r\n 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y']\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo now let's try to slightly modify you function fwd_unicode_matches:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [28]: def fwd_unicode_match(self, text:str):\r\n    ...:     # initial code based on latex_matches() method\r\n    ...:         slashpos = text.rfind('\\\\')\r\n    ...:         # if text starts with slash\r\n    ...:         print(slashpos) # debug\r\n    ...:         if slashpos > -1:\r\n    ...:             s = text[slashpos+1:]  # note the +1\r\n    ...:\r\n    ...:             print(s) # debug\r\n    ...:             # instead of looking wether it is unicode, return all the things from\r\n    ...:             #`names` that stars with `s`\r\n    ...:\r\n    ...:             return s, [x for x in names if x.startswith(s)]\r\n    ...:\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's try it:\r\n```\r\nIn [27]: fwd_unicode_match(None, '\\GRE')\r\n0\r\nGRE\r\nOut[27]: ('GRE', [])  \r\n```\r\n\r\nGood, nothing, we did not attempt to find greek letters so far. Let's try latin:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [28]: fwd_unicode_match(None, '\\LAT')\r\n0\r\nLAT\r\nOut[28]:\r\n('LAT',\r\n ['LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A',\r\n  'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER B',\r\n  'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C',\r\n  'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D',\r\n....\r\n```\r\n\r\nOk, sounds good. Let's try to add that [into completer.py](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/compare/master...Carreau:try-unicode-4).\r\n\r\n![xx](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335567/52014375-3b4a5e00-2494-11e9-9663-a87fbf928fce.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nOk, good ! It seem to work. \r\n\r\nNow we need to be a tiny bit fancier, and allow upper and lower case to match, and instead of allowing only 65 to 90 we want to try from 0 to `0`, `0x10FFFF + 1`.\r\n\r\nlet me know if that is helpful, I'm going to stop here on the explanation and let you play along with it.
