Just this Console (leaving the Kernel running), or the kernel and all connected Consoles?\n\n< Cancel | Just Console | Close Everything >\n\nIt really corresponds directly to the Close (cmd-W) vs Quit (cmd-Q) model of general applications. i.e. Close this Window (and leave everything else) vs. Quit this Application (and close/shutdown everything).  It's certainly less clear with the whole kernel/interprocess model.\n\nOn OSX, this model is actually quite standard, and might not need any dialog - it's not normal at all for hitting the close button on a window to terminate an application (in fact, it's sufficiently uncommon for an application to do this, it should be considered a bad native UI). However, that's not the case on other platforms, and a general issue when building cross-platform apps, not at all specific to us.\n"

    "body": "Ahh, that is quite different, missed that.  But then the current message is even more confusing.  Does this really automatically close all frontends connected to that kernel?  Do other frontends have any say so in the matter?  In the future it is entirely possible that the qtconsole app could connect to multiple kernels (in tabs maybe).  In that case, it really doesn't make sense to actually quit the other frontends. I guess I am thinking that it really should be:\n\nCancel | Console Only | Kernel and This Console\n\nIf ipkernel is started with the --parent flag, it starts a thread that watches for the parent pid.  When it goes away, the thread kills the process. This is used to make sure the ipkernel dies if the parent goes away.  Obviously, the \"Close Console Only\" option won't work when --parent is used.\n\nIt is much less clear, especially when other windows could be on other hosts.\n"

    "body": "Kernel and This Console isn't useful because other Consoles can't do anything once the Kernel goes away.\n\n'Close All' does close everything.  With the current setup, if you close the Kernel, all the other frontends are useless anyway, so they should be closed.  As it was before, if you closed the kernel (from anywhere), you would have a bunch of dangling frontends that can't do anything, unless the main parent decided to restart it.  If you closed the master frontend, then you left possibly several Windows without the ability to ever do anything, and no information on what happened.  If we change the frontend so that it's useful after the Kernel goes away, then the handling of a shutdown signal should be different, and that's easy to change.  For now, though, I don't see any reason to keep Consoles open that have no ability to do anything.\n\nThe shutdown notice is handled by the qtconsole object, so changing that logic when new functionality comes in will be easy (it's in FrontendWidget._handle_shutdown_reply())\nhttp://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/frontend/qt/console/frontend_widget.py#L365\n\nWhat you said about --parent is not true - it absolutely does work. The parent process is still alive, it's just not drawing a Console.  That was the whole point of adding this - closing the initial console without losing the kernel.\n"

For instance, if they wanted to save (or print!) what they have.  I don't think this is really necessary, at least on localhost - since there's no chance there that they don't know it's going down.  Perhaps only display the message when the other Consoles are not connected via localhost?\n\nPreviously, there was no mechanism for other Consoles to even know that the Kernel was shutdown (only that the heartbeat failed). But now we can handle the shutdown however we want.\n\nIf I open 3 Consoles on one kernel locally, do you really think I should get at least 2 'OK' buttons, just to let me shut it down?\n\nI think of it this way: If a user has multiple windows connected to a Kernel, there should be an easy way to close them all, and it should _not_ involve more than one dialog, and certainly not one dialog per window.\n\nBut if you are sharing a Kernel remotely, I can definitely imagine a disappearing window being quite distressing.\n"

    "body": "I just noticed another possible issue:  Remote kernels have the ability to shutdown the kernel, and local consoles will be shutdown automatically without warning. This is because it's the connection to the _kernel_ that gets checked for the warning, not the relationship with the sender (which is unknown).\n\nThe obvious solutions:\n1) have the shutdown message identify the sender's location. This can actually be inferred if we use uuid.uuid1() for session IDs, because that includes a MAC address in uuid.node (last 12 bytes).\n2) Prevent remote (non-localhost) Consoles from shutting down the Kernel - I'm not sure this is a bad idea, but it does restrict use cases. It is certainly the easiest answer.\n"
