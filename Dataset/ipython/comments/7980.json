Probably the easiest way to set the bit-ness of Python is with the environment variable:\n\n```\nexport VERSIONER_PYTHON_PREFER_32_BIT=yes\n```\n\nwith that set, any Python process in the same environment will run in 32 bit mode.  \n\nHowever, you cannot use 64b Anaconda in 32b mode, because it's 64b-only.\n\nWhy do you need 32b Python?\n"
