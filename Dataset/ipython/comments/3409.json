    "body": "Thanks a lot for tackling this one, it's been bugging me for some time.\n\nThis is a very good start but with the current `buffer_size` default (500 lines), there are still some usability issues (at least on my Linux machine):\n1. A `Ctrl+C` interruption takes a long time to be processed (like 2-3 secs), making believe the user that the frontend didn't really process it.\n2. The frontend takes a lot of time to show the `Kernel` menu, which makes very hard to trigger an interruption from there.\n3.  There is no visual feedback suggesting that the frontend is printing an ongoing output.\n\nFrom the user perspective, all these things would suggest that the console froze (although now it's not the case). \n\nRight now I'm trying to come up with a solution to improve this situation.\n"

I had actually written a very elaborate timer based mechanism to display output, but ended up with this as it very well for me with much simpler code too.\nI can try the timer based approach again if you can describe what platform/machine you are experiencing the slowness. I suspect it may be a graphics card issue because i also noticed the slowness a few times, when my nvidia graphics card slows down after wake from sleep (on linux), slowing down all applications with it.\n"
