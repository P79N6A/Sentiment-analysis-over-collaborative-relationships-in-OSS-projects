    "body": "It works fine under python 2.7, but I see in your traceback that you're installing with python 3.  What we need to do is unconditionally skip the mathjax `docs/` directory, and in most cases mathjax altogether.  I say in most cases, because I think in the long run it may actually be useful to provide alternate installers with mathjax bundled in: if people are going to download it later anyway, might as well give it to them right away and save them the hassles.  Obviously it should be optional, as it makes the download ~ 100mb larger, but could be very convenient for certain users.\n"
