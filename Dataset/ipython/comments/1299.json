Could you please rebase it on top of master and push again (you'll need to use `git push --force`)?  You'll have to fix some conflicts, but I think they should be pretty minimal.\n\nPlease let us know if you need a hand...\n\nWe'll do our best to review it quickly after the rebase so that this doesn't happen again.\n"
