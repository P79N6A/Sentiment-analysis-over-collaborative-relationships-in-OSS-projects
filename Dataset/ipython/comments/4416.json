    "body": "I would love that.\n\n@lgautier has done some _major_ work on improving pandas / numpy mechanisms in rpy2. So, I've copied the code, and set it up so `%load_ext rpy2.ipython` works, but then it gets screwed up because ri2py no longer works. This is a strong argument for moving this code into rpy2 (@lgautier could have done a global search for the functions he was changing in the rpy2 repo).\n\nIn any case, the relevant code is in: https://bitbucket.org/lgautier/rpy2/src/1f4a54c17cf2f387edfafa18aaebc6a6b9e49e87/rpy/ipython?at=rmagic\n\nThe only code that matters is in `rpy/ipython`. In particular, `__init__.py` enables `%load_ext rpy2.ipython`, and `rmagic.py` is mostly lifted from ipython with small mods. Tests are also lifted with slight modifications (and now in the tests subfolder).\n\nNote that I'm using the rmagic branch for now, but if @lgautier would rather, we can just work in the 2.4.x branch (which rmagic is based on).\n\nSorry I haven't been more responsive on this, but I'll try to help speed things along, and quickly respond to pull requests. You can also ask Laurent if you'd like commit rights.\n\nI'm emailing Laurent to see if he can quickly address the problems.\n"

    "body": "OK - so the root culprit turned out to be that numpy2ri no longer registers an ri2py function (which ipython rmagic expected).\n\nI've edited this file and things should be better now. If you run those tests in isolation (i.e. `python -m unittest rpy2.ipython`), all but one passes (and it looks like a problem with the test). If you run them in the full test suite (i.e. `pythyon -m rpy2.tests`) all of the ipython tests fail. I suspect there is a side effect somewhere that we're missing (note that the tests currently call pandas2ri or numpy2ri.deactivate at the top of the script).\n\nAlso note that I've moved development to the version_2.4.x branch. Please don't use the rmagic branch.\n\nIn general, while tests are not working, the code appears to work (for me).\n"
