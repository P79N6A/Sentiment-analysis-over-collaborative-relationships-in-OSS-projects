    "body": "Min pointed out that we should think about what we call our configurable classes, because those names become part of the config.\n\nBefore this PR, the relevant class was called Kernel. I've split it into `KernelBase` and `Kernel`, and as it happens, all the config values belonged on KernelBase. Existing config will still work, because you can apply config to subclasses of where the configurable traitlets are defined, but if people want their config to apply to non-IPython kernels written on top of this, they would need to change `Kernel` -> `KernelBase` in their config files.\n\nThe alternative would be to call the base class `Kernel`, and the subclass something like `IPythonKernel`.\n\nMin expressed a slight preference against classes named `*Base` (or `Base*` - we think there are both in the codebase), but we agreed that it might be appropriate here, because `KernelBase` cannot be used directly - it is only useful for subclassing.\n"
