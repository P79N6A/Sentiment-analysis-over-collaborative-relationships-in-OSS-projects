    "body": "@ivanov - I understood what you meant, but even so, I don't think the `profile doesn't exist` error shouldn't raise if you request a bundled profile for the first time, even for an app where `auto_create=False`.  But `auto_create` should certainly be True in the NotebookApp as you have done.  This need not be addressed in this PR, as I suppose it's a separate issue.\n\n@takluyver - That would also be addressed by making ShellApp set `auto_create=True`, and the NotebookApp should be a subclass of ShellApp, just like everything else that starts IPython shells, and this is what third-party apps should inherit from anyway.  It was a mistake to write it as we did, by copying/pasting a bunch of code, which has allowed it to fall out of sync as the original code was updated an improved.\n\nThe case for leaving the default as False is that apps for which False is the right default are ones that do less.\n\nSome background:\n\nOriginally, profiles _had_ to be created with `ipython profile create`, but we realized that when you start an IPython shell, you should be able to simply ask for a profile, and it will be created without staging any config files (or only those that are bundled).  This is _not_ the case in general, and in particular is not the case for things that must load some config  (ipengine, iplogger, ipcluster subcommands other than start), where no pre-existing config does mean there's definitely an error.  Since it has turned out that these are a minority of entry points, it may make sense to switch the default to True, which would require adding overrides to all apps that currently inherit the default, just as shell-starting apps and ipcontroller have overrides in the opposite direction now.\n"
