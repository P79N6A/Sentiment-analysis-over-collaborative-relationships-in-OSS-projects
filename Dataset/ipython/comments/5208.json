    "body": "This is deliberate, because if you call something in a for loop that returns a value:\n\n```\nfor line in lines:\n    f.write(line)  # Returns number of bytes written\n```\n\nYou probably don't want to see all those numbers in the output.\n\nThe rule in IPython is: if the last statement in your code is an expression, we display its value. `1;2` is a pair of statements, whereas `1,2` is one statement, so both values will display.\n\nI hope that explains things a bit. We're happy to revisit decisions like this, but it's been this way for years, and I don't think anyone has taken issue with it.\n"
