    "body": "There could be a bug in IPython (or tornado or pyzmq or libzmq) preventing the closing of file descriptors, but that is the limit being hit, so raising it will help.  If it's a bug, raising the limit will only increase the longevity of the process before it dies again.  If it's not a bug, and it really is concurrent actions going on (running kernels plus web frontends), then it will increase the amount of concurrent action you can have before it balks.\n"
