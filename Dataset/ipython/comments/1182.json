    "body": "I'd be inclined not to rebind Ctrl-R and Ctrl-D, because they have very different meanings in the terminal (search readline history and exit, respectively), so it may be annoying for people used to terminal IPython if they try a shortcut and something completely different happens. We might at some point want to implement Ctrl-R searching in the Qt console, as it's quite a popular feature.\n\nAlso, attach and detach are potentially confusing terms, because they could refer to the frontend attaching to the kernel.\n\nFor moving tabs around, can Qt emulate what Firefox and Chrome now do, where you can click and drag a tab away from the tab bar to separate it (and drag it back in to reattach it). I think this is called 'tear out tabs'.\n"
