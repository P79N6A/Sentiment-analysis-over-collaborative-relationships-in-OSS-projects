    "body": "I think you better specify what python-mode you are using.  (I suppose you are using python-mode.el + ipython.el, but still...)  And also Emacs version and IPython version.\n\nIf you are using the old python.el (one shipped with Emacs < 24), then I guess there is no hope getting it fixed.\n\nIf you are using the new python.el, https://github.com/fgallina/python.el (or Emacs mailing list) is better place to ask.\n\nIf you are using python-mode.el, https://launchpad.net/python-mode is better place to ask.\n\nI don't know much about ipython.el, but what is the point of using it?  Both python.el and python-mode.el support IPython now.\n"
