    "body": "It strikes me that that's a fair chunk of code which is only really used by IPython.parallel. Bringing it into core just to customise the display of an exception seems like the wrong way to go about this.\n\nI propose that we check for the existence of a particular method, like `render_traceback` (maybe the name should be more specific, to avoid collisions). If it exists, we use that to produce a traceback, rather than the usual structured_traceback helper. That way, other packages that need to do something similar can do it easily and Pythonically.\n"
