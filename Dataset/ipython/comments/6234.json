    "body": "I've done some investigation. When user copy text, it processed by inputsplitter, which adds a newline at the end of text:\n\n```\n# IPython/qt/console/frontend_widget.py\ntext = self._control.textCursor().selection().toPlainText()\nif text:\n    text = self._prompt_transformer.transform_cell(text)\n    QtGui.QApplication.clipboard().setText(text)\n```\n\nLooks like inputsplitter should work like this (note rstrip()):\n\n```\n# IPython/core/tests/test_inputsplitter.py\nfor raw, expected in [\n    (\"a=5\", \"a=5#\"),\n    # ...\n]:\n    out = isp.transform_cell(raw)\n    self.assertEqual(out.rstrip(), expected.rstrip())\n```\n\nSo, we probably can run rstrip() on text returned by transform_cell(). But what if user wants to copy newline or spaces? We need to check last character before passing text to transform_cell(). Text must be stripped by one character only if it's not newline.\n"
