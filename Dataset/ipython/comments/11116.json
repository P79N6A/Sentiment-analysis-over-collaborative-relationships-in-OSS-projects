    "body": "> This doesn't come up often\r\n\r\nIt does on our issue trackers!\r\n\r\nI'm trying to make headway on a new system of managing kernels, which will hopefully make identifying kernel types more consistent. In particular, the kernel type ID `pyimport/kernel` in the new system will always refer to a kernel running on the same Python interpreter as the parent process.\r\n\r\nBut it's a big set of changes, it's hard to find any time to work on it when I'm not already tired, and I've had next to no design feedback on it (though @mpacer is starting to look at it - thanks M!), so I'm worried that what I build may not be that useful."
