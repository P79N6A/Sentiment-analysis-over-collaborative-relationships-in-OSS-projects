    "body": "That does make sense, but it would mean that people who install IPython before Qt would have a different environment from people who install Qt before IPython.  I think that might cause more confusion rather than less.\n\nI believe it is standard practice to _not_ change install behavior based on runtime dependencies (as opposed to build dependencies), since install order is not relevant.\n\nI think better error messages (console messages don't count since ipython-qtconsole is a gui-script, and not connected to any terminal) should be an adequate solution.\n"

    "body": "I agree with @minrk.  It would also mean that if they install IPython, then learn about the Qt console and add Qt, they'd have to re-run the installer in order to get working shortcuts.  We can definitely improve our docs and error messages to point users in the right direction, but won't change the install-time behavior based on dependencies.\n\nWe make it pretty clear that we have a number of optional capabilities that require more than the stdlib, so I think this will stay as-is.  Thanks for the feedback, though!\n"
