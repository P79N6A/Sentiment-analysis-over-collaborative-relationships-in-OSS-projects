Perhaps the QtConsole could do the same?\n"

    "body": "It's not so much that the ordering is enforced by CPython as it is that sending data to the actual FDs happens promptly, and `stream.flush()` is rarely necessary.\n\nIn the kernel, things only get written to the pipe by `stream.flush`, which is called by `write` if it's \"been a while\" since the last flush (50ms).\n\nWe could easily be more aggressive about flushing (e.g on every write, or on every write containing `\\n`), but since each flush produces a message with associated overhead, flushing too frequently can be a significant performance degradation.\n"
