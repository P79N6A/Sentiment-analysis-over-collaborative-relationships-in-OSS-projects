The completion_display_matches_hook function could hold a reference to the completer which would provide the last autocompleted object.\n\nExample of problem:\n\nIn [30]: portal.<tab>\nDisplay all 919 possibilities? (y or n)\n\nHow to override the completion_display_matches_hook in Pythons earlier than Python 2.6:\n\nfrom ctypes import *\n\nrl = cdll.LoadLibrary('libreadline.so')\n\ndef completion_display_func(matches, num_matches, max_length):\n    print \"made you look\"\n\nCOMPLETION_DISPLAY_FUNC = CFUNCTYPE(None, POINTER(c_char_p), c_int, c_int)\nhook = COMPLETION_DISPLAY_FUNC(completion_display_func)\nptr = c_void_p.in_dll(rl, 'rl_completion_display_matches_hook')\nptr.value = cast(hook, c_void_p).value\n"
