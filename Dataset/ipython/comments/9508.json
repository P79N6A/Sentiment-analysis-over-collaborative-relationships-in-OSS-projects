    "body": "- Ptpython is a different project, see [here](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/ptpython/). However, IPython is now using the same library, prompt_toolkit, so they're quite similar.\n- You could embed either of these into your application using a Qt terminal widget. I think there are some out there, but I haven't used any, so I won't recommend one.\n- Alternatively, you could embed the [Jupyter Qtconsole](https://github.com/jupyter/qtconsole). This works in a very different way, but it still lets the user type in Python code and see the output. This is what [Spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder) uses, for instance.\n"
