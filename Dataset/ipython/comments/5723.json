    "body": "Yes, partially fixed. Wiki docs also updated. Double imports are fairly nasty bugs, though. I've really only seen one once before in my Python development over the past 10 years. Personally, I would  like to see the text changed to something like Test code location or output an extra line of debug with text like that. I don't think that line is redundant because it will make it very clear - to any of the 300 and growing IPython contributors - what code they are testing. This isn't for me - I've already read quite a bit of the code related to this so I won't be bit by this again - it's for new IPython developers that come after me. \n"
