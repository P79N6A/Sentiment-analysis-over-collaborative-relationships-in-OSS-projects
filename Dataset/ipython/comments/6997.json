    "body": "The doubling up of the notebook name sounds like an issue with JS being cached in your browser. Try hitting Ctrl-F5 a few times to clear the cache, or opening it in a private browsing window.\n\nAs for the original issue: I know there are things with Windows+Unicode+Python 2 that we've decided are not worth trying to resolve. I can't say for sure that this is one of them, but it certainly sounds like it could be. If you need full unicode support on Windows, you may have to use Python 3. As @Carreau says, with master it's possible to have the notebook server running in Python 3 and the kernel in Python 2. To do this:\n1. Set up Python 2 and IPython master\n2. Run `ipython2 kernelspec install-self`\n3. Set up Python 3 and IPython master (again)\n4. Run `ipython3 notebook`\n"

Last night I've installed most of the packages I need. Python2 is very painful for a long time when dealing with the Chinese characters. I chose py2 at the first place just because I hated the `print(a)` style of python3, then it became more difficulty when the env got more and more packages installed.  I even did some research trying to use the autocall magic of ipython to simulate the python2 style of `print a` in python3.\n\nBut even now I really miss the `print a` style in python2. I've got too used to it especilly when doing some simple calculate in terminal.\n"

    "body": "Thank you everyone @takluyver @minrk . I'm getting used to `print(a)` now. Actually I used `print` less and less as time going. Most of the time just `sr`, or `dr` will do the job.\n\nIpython notebook did very well handling unicode I think, even with a Chinese language Windows system . In the notebook, just by putting an “u\" before every string will dodge most of the unicode problems.\n\nAnyway, congratulatting myself finally decided to switch to python3. I'm still trying to make my pelican work.\n\nAgain, thank you all for your wonderful work, and patient answer.\n"
