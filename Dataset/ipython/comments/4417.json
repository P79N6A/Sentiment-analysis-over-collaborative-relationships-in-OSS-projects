    "body": "Hi, \n\nUnfortunately this is not top priority on our list, both for lack of manpower, \nand because we have few user that would give us feedback. \n\nStill the UI of notebook is quite customisable. If you heard of cell toolbar, you \nwill see that with the following snippet in your custom.js you can have a small workaround:\n\n```\n$([IPython.events]).on('app_initialized.NotebookApp', function(){\n    // add here logic that shoudl be run once per **page load**    \n\n    var edit =  function(div, cell) {\n        var button_container = $(div)\n        var button = $('<div/>').addClass('btn btn-mini').text('edit')\n        button.click(function(){ \n             cell.edit() \n        })\n        button_container.append(button);\n    }\n\n    IPython.CellToolbar.register_callback('android.edit', edit);\n    IPython.CellToolbar.register_preset('android', ['android.edit'])\n});\n```\n\n(i've selected \"android\" celltoolbar) \n![capture decran 2013-10-22 a 14 14 40](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/335567/1380859/1cdd6db0-3b13-11e3-8d92-4b26625a5f3d.png)\n\nI'll let you extend to add buttons like run-cell, cut/copy/past .. etc.\nAsk if you need help.\n\nMarking as wishlist.\n\nThanks.\n"

    "body": "Hi Matthias, thanks for your reply.\n\nI can understand if this is low priority, and I can't complain as it's not as if I'm paying or contributing anything towards the project...!\n\nI am having trouble getting your workaround to work however. I can't seem to find the place I need to put this code. Googling has shown a number of potential places for the custom.js file (which does not exist in my install), including profile_name/static/js/, profile_name/static/custom, and in profile_name/ itself.\n\nAlso, many of the webpages refer to the profiles being found in ~/.ipython, whereas mine is found in .config/ipython.\n\nMaybe it's the case that I'm not running the developer version of iPython Notebook? I don't want to install this unless this is a requirement however.\n\nAny help greatly appreciated.\n"

    "body": "This now works! Thanks very much for your help. Seems most of the problems were due to the old version of iPython on the Mint repositories. \n\nFor those who have the same problem, here are the steps I went through to upgrade to the new version on Mint 15 and get the <code>custom.js</code> code from @Carreau working. \n\nFirst I uninstalled the old version of iPython:\n\n<code>sudo apt-get remove ipython-notebook python-matplotlib python-scipy python-pandas python-sympy python-nose</code>\n\n(Not sure if I needed to uninstall everything, but I just did the reverse of what I did to install it to make sure everything was back to 'mint' condition...).\n\nThen I downloaded <code>ipython-1.1.0.tar.gz</code> and ran:\n\n<code>tar -xzf ipython-1.1.0.tar.gz</code>\n\n...the <code>cd ipython-1.1.0</code>, and <code>sudo python setup.py install<code>, which appeared to run without errors.\n\nI then went back to my pre-existing notebooks, ran <code>ipython notebook --profile=nbserver</code>, which failed saying a module called <code>jinja2</code> was missing.\n\nTo install this, you need <code>easy_install</code>, which is part of <code>python-setuptools</code>:\n\n<code>sudo apt-get install python-setuptools</code>\n\n...followed by:\n\n<code>sudo easy_install Jinja2</code>\n\nAfter this, my notebook would start as normal. I like the newer interface! The old version would explain my initial confusion about the \"cell toolbar\", which I had initially assumed was some kind of background process, as it is not on the interface in the old 0.13 version.\n\nTo get @Carreau 's <code>custom.js</code> working, I created the file: <code>~/.config/ipython/profile_nbserver/static/custom/custom.js</code>, and placed the code above into it before restarting my notebook server.\n\n(NB: as mentioned above, this may be <code>~/.ipython/profile_nbserver/static/custom/custom.js</code> for some people....)\n\nAnd hey presto, there was an option to select \"android\" under \"Cell Toolbar\". When pressed, this opens the cell for editing. I haven't found that using shift-Return in the soft keyboard on Android works, but pressing the \"Play\" button on the toolbar performs the same function.\n\nMany thanks again for your time working this out @Carreau !\n"
