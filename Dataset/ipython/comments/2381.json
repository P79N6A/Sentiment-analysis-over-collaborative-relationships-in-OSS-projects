It's doable, but it hasn't been done.\n\nI vote for closing this and opening an enhancement PR about line\ncontinuations in general for all input flitering, which we can then resolve\nas part of the big refactoring that @takluyver is undertaking on that front.\n\nNote: I don't mean that Thomas has to fix this as well, simply that we can\nhandle it there, even if handling it means deferring it to a later cycle of\nrefinement of that refactoring.  That decision will be up to Thomas, who's\ntackling the brunt of that effort.\n"
