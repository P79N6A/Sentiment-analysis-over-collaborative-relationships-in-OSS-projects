So what I'd like to have, before committing this, is a set of tests in a file named test_unicode.py, that encapsulates all of the recent unicode work.\n\nUnfortunately a lot of these unicode fixes have been made in a completely ad-hoc manner, as people report problems, but we don't have a centralized list of cases to check against.  His may be a reasonable fix, for all I know, but I'm afraid that if we apply it we'll get back 10 old bugs again.  I don't know, maybe not, but there's simply no way to be sure.\n\nI'm one of the most ignorant of our bunch in unicode issues, blissfully living in the stupidity of the ascii world.  It would be great if one of us who knows more about this stuff could at least write a set of simple unicode tests that catch many of the recently reported encoding problems.  Jorgen, Ville, any chance you guys could take this up at some point?  You know about it a lot more than I do...\n"

At least the file\ncan be run by the test suite automatically and not crashing is a good\nstart.  Core developers can then re-run it by hand (we can put an \"if\n**name**\" main section at the bottom for this) to check visually.\nThis is basically what we are doing now with snippets all over the\nmailing list, I'm just suggesting that unless all those checks are:\n- collected in one file\n- auto-executed\n\nwe'll never get anywhere reliable on these unicode problems.  We can\nthen have a note to manually do\n\n%run test_unicode\n\nourselves for the full visual verification.\n\nCheers,\n\nf\n"

I guess IPython developers possess a bit more knowledge of the immense innards of the package than reporters of the bug do, so users could expect at least some guidelines for writing tests, could they?\n\nMaybe we should allow to tune bug-related behaviour in user settings until the bug is finally fixed?
