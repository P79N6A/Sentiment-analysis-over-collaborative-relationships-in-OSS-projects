    "body": "We have seen cases were the line breaking was pretty bad in Sage, so we turned it off in the Sage cell server by default.  This may just be from the way Sage formats the latex for expressions---I don't know if you'll see problems with sympy.  IIRC, we were seeing things like breaking on coefficients multiplied by variables, stemming from Sage's habit of inserting a space between a numeric coefficient and the variable in a polynomial (e.g., $3\\ x + 5\\ x^2$).\n"
