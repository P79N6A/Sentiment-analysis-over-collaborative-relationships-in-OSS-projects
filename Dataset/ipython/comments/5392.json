    "body": "I've been thinking about this: it would be a fairly straightforward hack to create a widget which displays matplotlib pngs, and uses javascript to recognize mouse drags and send this info to MPL to re-render the plot. I seem to remember @ellisonbg mentioning potential for this type of thing, but I don't know of any progress on it yet.\n\nAlso, there's the WebGL backend for matplotlib which should do this natively. I'm not sure how mature that is right now, though.\n"
