    "body": "Following the discussion with @Carreau in a related nbconvert PR: https://github.com/ipython/nbconvert/pull/180, I have updated this PR:\nNow we have a new preset called Reveal, which enhanced the Slideshow preset with alignment options. \nBecause the live slideshow and reveal-based slideshow are different in nature, they need different properties or features so seem reasonable to get two different presets.\nThe Reveal preset is derived from the Slideshow preset... the idea behind this structure is that if the user select the Slideshow preset, he can still get a working reveal-based slideshow (the simpler default form but, obviously, with less features to use and possibilities to change things).\n"
