    "body": "1. Maybe it installed a newer version?\n2. IPython may be used in situations where it's the only interface you have to that machine - e.g. if a teacher runs notebooks on a server for their students using Jupyterhub. For that reason, you can now edit text files in the web interface as well. Why was this a nasty surprise? Directories and notebooks should be sorted at the top of the list, so we didn't expect it to be a problem.\n3. Could be a caching issue - press Ctrl-F5 a few times to refresh, or try in a different browser.\n4. There are people working on it. See takluyver/IRkernel#54.\n"

    "body": "Getting images inline: I see what you mean now. No, `--matplotlib` no longer works with the notebook (you should get a warning message about it in the terminal). Use `%matplotlib inline` within the notebook instead. We changed this because it was too easy to create notebooks assuming that the server was started with `--matplotlib` or `--pylab`, which didn't work as expected when other people ran them. Also, as you note, it's meaningless for non-IPython kernels.\n\nUTF-8 BOM: It's not common practice to put a BOM before UTF-8 encoded text. Again, any decent editor should handle files without it correctly, but notepad won't. I don't think we'd consider changing what we do there.\n\nExe files: We show all files. There's no reliable way to tell what's text and what isn't without reading every single file, so we don't try to guess, we just show them all.\n\nLost the end of a notebook: Not sure how that could happen. If you find a way to reproduce it, definitely file a bug.\n\nWarning about widgets: There's nothing to change at the moment, it's just a note of caution because we're still thinking about the design of widgets, so the API may well change a lot in the next couple of releases.\n"
