    "body": "This one is tied to #993, which it should help a lot with.  It's definitely one of our remaining key issues before we can put 0.12 out, so any help will be greatly appreciated.  Pinging @prabhuramachandran who recently contributed some improvements to the Qt code, in case you have some insights.  As explained in #993, it's really easy right now to 'wedge' the qt console when taking raw input from the user, such as is the case during `%debug` sessions.\n\nThis PR already massively improves things, so if nothing else we'll merge it as-is.  But it would be great if folks with better understanding of the Qt code spot ways to improve the situation.\n\n@Carreau, you might also have some ideas, given your recent work on the console.\n\nIn any case, I'm just trying to ping anyone who can help us out :)\n"

Have a great time at Scipy.In!  \n\nBTW, if you or your team later on have some bandwidth, you can filter the issues list to view only the [Qt console issues](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues?labels=qtconsole&sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1).  If you spot anything there that you can take a crack at, we'd greatly appreciate it.  We don't have too much Qt expertise in the core team, so all of this rests mostly on @epatters' shoulders; it would be great to have some extra hands on those bugs.\n"
