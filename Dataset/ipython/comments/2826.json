    "body": "Well, there's already a versioning mechanism in the current master, where the protocol version is transmitted.\n\nHere's what I'd do:\n\nIf the frontend sends a kernel_info and gets no answer, assume \"pyin\"/\"pyout\".\nIf the frontend sends a kernel_info and the protocol version is too low, use \"pyin\"/\"pyout\".\nIf the frontend sends a kernel_info and the protocol version is high enough, use whatever's new.\n\nSeems simple enough to me. There's still time to fix this before it gets really hard, even though it's just a minor annoyance.\n"

    "body": "At this point in development, I would discourage any project from trying to maintain compatibility with multiple versions of the notebook, it's just too new.  A simple message-type rename is not actually a huge deal, especially since there are probably _zero_ places in any code in the world that actually pay any attention to `pyin` messages (outside IPython.parallel).  So it's really just pyout here.\n\nWhat I currently think is the best solution so far is to eliminate pyout entirely, and add a key to the `display_data` message to indicate that it is the prompt / cell result.  Then there isn't even a new message to handle, it's just how we deal with the relationship of outputs and prompts.\n"
