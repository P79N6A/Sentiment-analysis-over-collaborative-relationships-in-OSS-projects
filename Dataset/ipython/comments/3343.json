    "body": "I've had a bit more of a look into this. It's scraping several pages, so we should get a nice speedup in installation by doing this. It's also good for security: as [PEP-438](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0438/) points out, anyone who can do an HTTP man in the middle attack could currently deliver malicious code to a user trying to install IPython.\n\nUsers would no longer be able to `pip install ipython==` dev (which doesn't work anyway), 0.9.1, 0.9 or 0.8.4. Of course you could still manually download and install them if you had a particular need, so I'm not too worried that the automated installer tools won't find those old versions.\n\nThat seems like a no-brainer, so I've gone ahead and flipped the switch. We can flip it back if we find problems.\n"
