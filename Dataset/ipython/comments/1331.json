A few comments:\n- plaintext: probably a good idea, so there's a way for people to more easily implement other transformations onto their notebooks.\n- I think we can leave for now both markdown and rst.  Honestly for lots of stuff markdown is just easier to type...\n- UI element: My vote would be for a dropdown menu in the (yet to be written) toolbar, that both shows the current style and lets you select it. Most word processors and lyx work this way, and I think it's a good solution.  It gives immediate visual feedback and makes changing styles easily, so it's efficient use of the screen space used.\n- keybindings: I'd make C-m-<1>..<6> for heading-1..6.\n\nAwesome job!  I haven't reviewed the code yet, just playing with the functionality for now.\n"

It's fine if for now there's not\nmuch UI  feedback on the style, I think the fact that they render\nvisibly differently is OK for the time being.\n\n> - Keybindings: these are already in place, let me know if they are not working.\n\nAh, I didn't realize because they weren't listed in the keybindings\nhelp screen.  Which btw, is starting to get long in the vertical\ndirection.  I wonder if we should make it two-columns, like the gmail\none (type ? while in the message list view to see theirs).\n\nBut they seem to work fine, which is awesome!\n"

It also seems to work fine, the only changes I see still pending are:\n- Change the RST label, and have a keybinding for this cell type.\n- List the cell type keybindings in the help popup.\n- Add the new cell types to the dropdown menu in the toolbar.  That would be IMO sufficient UI feedback for this. I imagine later on we could for example add something in the editing mode where a small area atop the cell itself shows its type, so that even without the toolbar one could directly see the type of a cell when editing it.  But this is just thinking out loud for the future; as far as I'm concerned once the dropdown menu lists all cell types, we're good for now.\n\nDid I miss anything?\n"

This very nearly bit me yesterday, as I was writing (using master) a [set of notebooks](https://github.com/ivanov/AY250) for a lecture at Berkeley, that were meant to be used by a bunch of students using EPD.

If you do not want this to happen, reopen it with the older version of IPython used to create it.\"\n\nor similar.  We don't want to say that on save, b/c by that point the user may have already done a bunch of work, so I think that warning on open is the right approach.\n\nI'm at the airport about to board a flight, so I'll be offline at least until tomorrow; but I think pinging the lists (both -dev and -user) soon explaining this would  be a good idea.\n"

    "body": "- We have always been handling notebook conversions in this manner -\n  the only difference is that not many people ever had v1 notebooks\n  (mostly a few core devs) and we converted our notebooks long ago and\n  never released the v1 code.\n\nRight, and this is why this is the first _real_ notebook increment.  The notebook format was v2 before it was even in master, I think, and certainly well before anybody other than you and Fernando were using it for real.\n- We can add a dialog/notification when a notebook is converted to a new version...\n\nYes, I think we must do this.  It is _terrible_ practice to silently upgrade in a destructive way, which we are doing in master now.  Information is preserved, but compatibility is destroyed.\n- But, we can't give the user the option to not convert.  The reason\n  is that by the time the notebook has gotten to the client/JS it has\n  already been converted.  The client/JS code only knows how to handle\n  the current version of the nbformat and _all_ conversions are done\n  server side before passing the notebook to the client.\n\nI think that's fair. We just want to avoid destroying their ability to collaborate with 0.12 users without giving them a chance to take some precautions.  Probably just offering to: save / cancel / duplicate old version before save should do it.  If we want a 'compatibility mode', we would need to define a v3->v2 conversion on the server side, which would of course not be lossless as we are adding new metadata and cell types, but would still probably be useful.\n- I will add the dialog and some other code to handle these issues in a separate PR.\n- I will also notify the list about these changes.\n\nGreat, thanks!\n"
