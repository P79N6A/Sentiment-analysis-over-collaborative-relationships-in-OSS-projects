As far as I understand it would make sense update the readme to point to the jupyter notebook readme and project page for now.\n\n_I can make pull requests for the above if that would help._\n\n## Nice to have\n\nIt would be helpful to have some more documentation on what the plan is for the split and the roadmap going forward. Without this information it's time consuming to decide if something is a bug or just unfinished and needing more work. \n\n## Context\n\nMy initial goal was to see if I could use HTML5's getusermedia to capture mic audio and camera video in the notebook to make it really easy to play with signal processing. I thought this would be a 1/2 day task but immediately found what looked like a bug in `IPython.display.Javascript`. While trying to setup a dev environment to investigate I came across this issue of the current documentation being out of date and other bugs when running Jupyter on windows.\n\nI would like to help improve Jupyter. The R&D team I used to lead made extensive use of IPython Notebook, we had a sophisticated analysis and client report generation framework built on top of the notebook which was awesome. Currently I find myself with a lot of free time so I'd like to give back.\n\nI will get round to ask on the googlegroup if there is anything I can help but at the moment I'm reading though all the documentation I can find.\n"
