    "body": "Previously, execute in place _deleted_ the old input to make it easier\nto type new input.  This is similar to how the terminal based IPython\nworks.  But, it was decided that deleting the old input was a bit too\ndrastic so we decided to just highlight the old input so that _if_ a\nuser wants to delete it and start fresh, it was a single key stroke.\nBecause the execute in place mode is designed to emulate a terminal\nexperience, I think this behavior does make sense.\n\nOn Tue, Nov 29, 2011 at 11:58 AM, thomas\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Executing a cell in place with Ctrl-x in the ipython notebook selects/highlights the whole text in the cell during the execution and stays selected afterwards. Is this intended ? Â I would prefer an unselected cell after an in-place-execution. Furthermore, the insertion-point (the \"|\" text-cursor) should be on the same position as before the in-place-execution, to \"alleviate\" further edits in the active cell.\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/1066\n\n## \n\nBrian E.
