    "body": "To clarify from #9603: this is not a regression, the bug was already there, but it was masked by the `autoedit_syntax` flag not working at all in previous versions.\n\nIt's supposed to trigger when there's a syntax error in a separate file, and there's code that tries to bypass it when the error comes from a prompt (see [here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/c963f6b4435fb150ebe995460649923b3ffc5e71/IPython/terminal/interactiveshell.py#L749)). But that code is out of date and doesn't pick up the filenames we now use for code typed at the prompt.\n\nPlaying devil's advocate a bit: `autoedit_syntax` has probably been broken for years, and we don't have lots of people complaining about it. We only discovered this because of something @asmeurer forgot in his config file. Maybe we should just ditch the feature.\n"
