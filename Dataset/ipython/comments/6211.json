Another way to fix it is to add a third callback, an unchanged callback, and then guarantee that the added and unchanged callbacks are called in order to reconstruct the list.  The problem with an index argument is that it then becomes a bit more complicated because the index reference may keep changing.  For example, what would you propose happen to the index argument in your case?  What if the new list was `wxabyzcmn`?\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the time to sort this out is better spent on the eventful list/model collection pr.
