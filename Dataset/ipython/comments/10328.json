    "body": "OMG it's a mess. \r\n\r\nI'm really unsure how to do it without changing tons of API to pass results around without changing the bowels of IPython behaves. Unless we accept that IPython shows extra stacktraces for run that show the inside of IPython, in which case it's just a matter of changing tests. \r\n\r\n@takluyver is there a way to re-raise omitting some stacks ?  We could do that (or generally add an option to IPython's showtraceback that skip traceback internal frames?)"

    "body": "Yeah, I think I suspected that this one was going to be tricky, and that's why I hadn't tried to fix it.\r\n\r\nWe have `UsageError` which magics can raise to fail with a one-line message rather than a full traceback. Maybe we should add an exception type like `SilentError` which they can use to indicate failure when they have already taken care of displaying the error details."
