Not sure about Linux. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.metaKey\n\nI still don't get why `ctrl-s` should be disabled on OS X? If other shortcuts work the same, this can break user expectation. So unless there is a conflict with some systems keys, I'd move all OS X specific stuff to a separate section, and yes, if there _is_ a conflict, it should be documented in comments IMO.\n\nIt is awesome that shortcut usage is counted. Now that all information is here I understand what is the difference between action and function. Because we need multiple shortcuts for the same action, I see it like top level JSON with `action name -> function` mapping, separate `shortcut -> action name` mapping, and a reverse `action name -> shortcut` map for help lookups. The reverse map is 1:1, and it is taking the last shortcut for the same action by design, as it is more specific (if the order of shortcut initialization is `default -> OS specific -> user specific`.\n"
