See : https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel\r\n\r\nCan you give an example (or a screenshot of the whole window?), are the prompt saying `In[*]`, or `In[1]` ? In the console you used to start the notebook, do you see any error messages ? \r\n"

Now it is like that:\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28626390/46748309-f4a1df80-ccbb-11e8-84c5-8fa1c4bf95e0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut before it was giving output of first line as 4 but for the second and the other lines nothing was appeared as output. What do you recommend for me?"
