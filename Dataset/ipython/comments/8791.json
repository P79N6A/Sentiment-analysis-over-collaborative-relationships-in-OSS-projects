    "body": "> Could classic_prompt() yield transformed line, only if all the lines after the initial_re match prompt_re ?\n\nNot really. We have this complex system of transformers handling things line by line so that in a console environment, it can decide after each line whether input is complete, and it should execute, or incomplete, and it should prompt for another line.\n\nWe could alleviate this particular case by saying that if the first line begins with `%` or `!`, it must be IPython syntax, so `classic_prompt()` should ignore the rest of the cell. But you'd still have the same problem using writefile if the next line started with `In [1]:`.\n\nTrying to guess what the user means is hard!\n"
