    "body": "Yes, the -keyout option specifies the name of the output file for the private key. The -out options specifies the file for the certificate. They can not have the same name as this will result in the key-file to be overwritten by the certificate file. I think that the .key extension is commonly used for private keys but I've also seen the use of .pem. If .pem is to be used for the key file then key file name would have to change, e.g.:\nopenssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout **mykey**.pem -out mycert.pem\n\nBut the naming of the files is a matter of taste as long as their names are not identical.\n"
