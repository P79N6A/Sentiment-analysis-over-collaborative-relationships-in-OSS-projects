    "body": "The comms and widgets are very much tied to the kernel.  If you have multiple kernels, you need to have multiple managers, one for each kernel.\n\nI use the kernel.js in the cell server, but not the main.js file.  We do use comms and widgets outside of the notebook right now.  I suppose I could manually start a manager for each kernel we start up, but I'd say let's wait for a usecase before splitting out the comm manager and widget manager from the kernel.  In my mind, the kernel encompasses the communication with the server, and as such, it's a natural place for these things to start up and live.\n"

If you have multiple kernels, you need to have multiple managers, one for each kernel.\n\nI know it's not as convenient but we could do it in such a way that the function which called the kernel constructor was responsible for initializing the comm and widget managers.
