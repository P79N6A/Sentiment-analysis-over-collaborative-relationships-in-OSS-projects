Tests should be in `IPython.lib.tests.test_display`, which it looks like you'll need to create. An addition to the docs would probably be a good idea, but I don't know where off the top of my head. A bullet point could go in What's New, at least.\n\nDoes `LocalFile` make sense as the name? From the perspective of a user editing a notebook with a kernel in the cloud, the files are remote. Perhaps something like `FileLink`? But let's get another opinion on this.\n"

Alphabetically is fine for now, in future revisions a richer API for sorting could be added but let's not over-engineer for now.\n- For `FileLinks`, when a directory contains subdirs, I think the recursive walking is great but there should be a visual cue that there's a subdir.  Otherwise it's hard to make out visually what comes from where.  Something like\n\n```\nfoo.txt\nbar.txt\n[ Subdir name ]\nfoo2.txt\n[ subdir/subdir]\nfoo3.txt\n```\n\nAt least that would make the output in more complex cases far more usable than the current one.\n\nThese should be easy fixes to apply, and otherwise I think this is a great contribution.

The FileLinks output is now formatted nicer, indicated the subdirectory names in a way similar to your example above, and output is now sorted alphabetically. The formatting of the display is parameterized, so it should be relatively straightforward to customize. You can see a (silly) example of how to do that in `IPython/lib/tests/test_display.py` - see `test_existing_path_FileLinks_repr_alt_formatter` and `test_existing_path_FileLinks_alt_formatter`. \n"

    "body": "I think this is ready for a merge when you guys are ready for it. We have a QIIME release on Dec 18th, so the sooner the better for us as we want this to be accessible in the AWS VM that we put out with the release, and we need time for testing.\n\nThe motivation for providing the display formatters as a function is that it's easier for users to customize how the output is formatted (e.g., @fperez suggested that we might want to support richer sorting functionality for the directory listings). This way users can format differently without subclassing `FileLink` or `FileLinks` (which I think would get ugly if we had a bunch of different options for formatting). We also need different formatting for the notebook and the terminal (i.e., HTML versus plain text), but most of the functionality is the same for both. Previously there was no `_get_display_formatter` method, and there was a lot of overlap between `_get_notebook_display_formatter` and `_get_terminal_display_formatter`. \n\nDoes this answer your question?\n"

    "body": "I like to avoid adding complexity until it is actually needed, not just because it might someday be needed.  The most likely usage case is that someone adds _one_ option that controls how things are formatted.  We definitely have lots of other display classes that have a handful of options.  My problem with the design is that I can't look at the class and see that is does something super simple = take a file or directory and provide an HTML or text repr.\n\nIf the display formatters we lightweight functions, then I could imagine it would be nice to pass them into the class.  But they are somewhat complex and it is very likely - almost  for sure - that they would want to access helper methods of the class.  In such cases subclassing is a _perfect_ solution.\n\nEven if you want to keep the current design, you have an extra layer of indirection that makes it difficult to find the actual formatting logic.  You define a `_get_display_formatter` method, that returns an inner-defined function that does the actual formatting.  Then you grab that function using code like this:\n\n``` python\nself.notebook_display_formatter = \\ \n    notebook_display_formatter or self._get_notebook_display_formatter()\n```\n\nWhy not put the default formatting logic in a method called `_default_notebook_display_formatter` and then simply set `self.notebook_display_formatter` to that method?\n\nAlso, I would prefer to use `HTML` rather than `notebook` formatter and `text` rather than `terminal` formatter.  The reason is that all formats are actually sent to all cients, so it is entirely possible that the notebook could display the text version.  Also, the QtConsole will also display the HTML format.  I was very confused to see language about the frontends appear in the display code and it took me a while to realize what was meant.\n\nBUT, I realize that you want to get this merged quickly and non of this affects the public API of these classes.  I will leave it up to you to decide if you want to make any changes or merge as is.  If you do want to merge as is, please let me know and I will do that right away.\n"
