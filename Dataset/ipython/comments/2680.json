I can't think\nof any, but there may be and we want to get this right.\n\nAs far as using section or slide:  in all of the major presentation\nsoftware I have ever seen \"slide\" means something very precise: the\nfundamental unit of content that is shown on the slide at one time.  How\nslides are organized into the overall structure of the talk (using\nsections, etc.) is a completely different question.  Ahh, but this\nclarifies some of what you were maybe thinking about:  Here is what i\npropose:\n- new_slide = use on a cell that begins a new units of content that will\n  appear on the screen at one time (ignoring transitions within the slide).\n- new_second = begins a new group of cells that belong together logically.\n  This can only be applied to a cell that also has \"new_slide\" (sections\n  have to begin at the same point as new slides).  In reveal.js sections will\n  be vertically oriented groups of slides.\n- new_fragment = this one is completely separate right?\n\nOn Fri, Dec 14, 2012 at 11:55 AM, Bussonnier Matthias <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> I see that you have the new section/subsection/fragment as separate\n> boolean options.
