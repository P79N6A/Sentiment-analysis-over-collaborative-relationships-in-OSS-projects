    "body": "Hi, I'm the developer behind \"ipython-desktop\" https://github.com/mangecoeur/ipython-desktop, a proof-of-concept a desktop-integrated ipython notebooking using node-webkit. From my perspective (and as a design point in general) having customizable keyboard shortcuts is really important, since once of the great advantages of the desktop integration is you have no collision with broswer shortcuts.\n\nIt would also be very useful if IPython exported an api for 3rd party JS scripts to hook into. In my case it's the JS I inject into the notebook page on load, but you could imagine people wanting to write greasemonkey scripts or notebook JS plugins that want to hook into the shortcuts  and menu\n\nI haven't dived into the IPython code yet so not sure what the status is now. Ideal would be to have an events-based system where you can broadcast events into IPython and attach callbacks for ipython events (personally I would use this to hook into some AngularJS event shenaigans). It would also help to be able to get the menu structure as a json.\n"
