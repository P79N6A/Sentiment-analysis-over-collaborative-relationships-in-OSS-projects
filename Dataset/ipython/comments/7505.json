However, I think it should display if atleast one of the items selected are a notebook that is running.  That way, when we add a way for the user to select all X (i.e. notebooks), the shutdown button will work- it will shutdown all of the notebooks it can. \n\n> On delete, I get TypeError: undefined is not a function.\n\nWhoops, last minute change I did not check before committing, will fix.\n"

Obviously, the\nright way to do this is to have the content areas of each tab scroll (page\nnever scrolls), but I was a little worried about that being a rabbit hole.\nWhat about this:\n- Let's merge this with the existing rough set of functionality (but proper\n  review and testing) soon so more people can try it out.\n- Let's gather feedback and see what other changes we want to make before\n  we release, and in the meantime explore how we can implement the scrolling\n  in a clean way.\n- One example of an additional change would be to have a dropdown at the\n  top that quickly let's a user select different sets of things like {all\n  notebooks, all running notebooks, all files, all directories}.
