    "body": "> i thought it might be helpful, also, it would keep the script from crashing on a failed import\r\n> View changes\r\n\r\nWell, if there is a failed import then the script will not work. Preventing the error message at import is just asking for trouble later. Plus all of these are from standard library modules that can't be missing. \r\nIf they are missing then something is deeply wrong with your Python install. \r\n\r\nA better way of having optional modules is to import them in the function using them:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef foo():\r\n     import mod\r\n     mod.dostuff()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen `mod` will be imported only if `foo()` if used, so `mod` can be an optional dependency.\r\nI can see this maybe of use for `functools` case for this file, but it's part of the standard lib as well on Py3 so no need to protect or delay it. \r\n\r\nNote that you can do the following to see what modules are already loaded at Python startup:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python3\r\nPython 3.6.0 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, Dec 23 2016, 13:19:00)\r\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> import sys\r\n>>> sys.modules['functools']\r\n<module 'functools' from '/Users/bussonniermatthias/anaconda/lib/python3.6/functools.py'>\r\n>>> sys.modules['warnings']\r\n<module 'warnings' from '/Users/bussonniermatthias/anaconda/lib/python3.6/warnings.py'>\r\n>>>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see that warning, and functools are already available are are thus required for Python to work. \r\nYou can also use `sys.modules.keys()` to see the full list. \r\n\r\nFor these catching import error will never trigger at is is a no-op (except binding the name)\r\nIf we were to go this route (which we probably won't unless special case), you might want to separate the \"ImportError\" from \"ModuleNotFound\" (like package not installed). And a good practice is to reraise, or at least print the current stack (even if you don't reraise) as the stack get the __reason__ for the error. \r\n"
