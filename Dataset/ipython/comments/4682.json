I was playing with the idea of a `Hightlight2Html.css_class_template` parameter.\n\n**Example**\n\n``` bash\nnbconvert --Highlight2Html.css_class_template=\"prettyprint lang-{lang}\"\n```\n\nwhere `{lang}` is replaced by the language for the block. It would result in (for python code) something like: `<pre class=\"prettyprint lang-python\">...</pre>` \n\nThis way the user can \"easily\" customize the classes.

In this PR there is `--HTMLExporter.javascript_highlight`, which restrains to HTML.\n\nSo I'll rephrase to see if I've got things straight this time : your proposal is to remove this flag and replace it with a `--Highlight2(Html|Latex).highlight_enabled` that would be inherited from a `HighlightBase` class. If true use pygment, else use `<pre class=\"...\">` in HTML and ... what in TeX? (I don't know enough TeX to have a clue here).  I'm 90% OK with this (the remaining is the TeX bit). Is this what you meant?\n\nThen I could add `--Highlight2*Html*.css_class_template (Unicode, default=\"{lang}\")` flag to further customize what `Highlight2*Html*` puts in the `pre class=\"...\"` as exposed above.\n\nNow, I realize I haven't identified what you were referring to in your first comment when you mentioned `--no-highlight`...\n"

I'll factorize these two module's code into one base class.\n\n@minrk I think that the basic mechanism of toggling preprocessed highlight on/off should be supported by both tracks (because the selection of the renderer is somewhat opaque to the user). It already is in this branch and the implementation should become more maintainable with some factorization. I also think (or see in my crystal ball) that the marked track will naturally supersede the pandoc track (mainly because it is consistent with how it is done in the live notebooks). So if future killer features are too much of a headache to port to the pandoc track, well... too bad?\n"
