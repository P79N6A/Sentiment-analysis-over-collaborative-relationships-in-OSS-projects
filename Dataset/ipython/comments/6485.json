    "body": "Apparently the comm object has become more sophisticated since I originally wrote this code.  You're right, @jdfreder, that the open things don't make much sense.\n\nLooking at the code now, and especially after #6540, it looks like it would be best to have a very simple mock session object instead of a mock comm object.  The session object is really the lower level pipeline, so messages should be caught there.  At least, the comm object should be tested by having a mock session object.\n"
