The `.addBack` doesn't seem controversial, but I can imagine some pushback on the `:top` css-like syntax for the top-level `this.$el` element (regardless of what `this.$el_to_style` is).  Having access to the CSS for the top-level container is important, but currently there is no way to get a selector for it.\n"

I'm optimistic that by having a more generic selector to get $el, like you suggest here, we'd be able to get rid of the custom logic in PopupView.\n\nOn the one hand, I like your extension better than mine because it supports adding stuff after the custom selector (by finding on the stuff after the special selector).  On the other hand, it wouldn't work well if you did something like `modal.myclass`, would it?  That should select only a modal element that has class .myclass, but your result would be any element beneath modal having class `myclass`.\n"
