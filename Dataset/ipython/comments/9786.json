    "body": "Hi. This is not in prompt-toolkit yet. It would require `FloatContainer.preferred_height` [1] to look at height of both the content and the floating objects (the menu, in our case).\nMaybe, I'll implement several expansion strategies, because I'm not sure whether everyone prefers exactly the same. (Currently, it has the advantage that the prompt is pushed up only once. If you go on, and press \"Tab\" for a second completion, it should stay in place.)\n\n[1] https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/master/prompt_toolkit/layout/containers.py#L389\n"
