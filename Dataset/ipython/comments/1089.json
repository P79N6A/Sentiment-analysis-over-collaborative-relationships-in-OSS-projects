    "body": "Thanks for this! A few comments:\n1. Rather than changing the main regex and processing loop, just add '\\r' and '\\b' to `SPECIAL_PATTERN = re.compile('([\\f])')`, then add a few lines here: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/frontend/qt/console/ansi_code_processor.py#L235.\n2. Please unit test this functionality (see https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/frontend/qt/console/tests/test_ansi_code_processor.py). This is one of the few components of the Qt console that's easy to test, so let's not miss the low-hanging fruit.\n\nThanks again. I'm sure others will appreciate this.\n"

    "body": "1. I don't think this creates the correct semantics.  SPECIAL_PATTERN is not used for splitting the string, only finding characters in it.  But we need to insert the `carriage-return` action at exactly the point in the string where it appears.  I would expect:\n\n```\nIn [1]: print 'foo\\rbar'\nbar\n```\n\n  but by putting everything in SPECIAL_PATTERN, one gets:\n\n```\nIn [1]: print 'foo\\rbar'\nfoobar\n```\n\n  Admittedly, for the `\\b` character, I don't think it's as crucial.\n1. Very good point.  I've added some tests that work against the current commits (using the '\\r' and '\\b' characters as split points).\n"
