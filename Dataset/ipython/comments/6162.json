    "body": "> it seems like it would be very easy to mark a Raw Cell in such a way that it would appear the same in nbviewer as it does in the live notebook\n\nRaw cells are, by definition, cells whose raw content passes through nbconvert unmodified. This is their only reason for existing. nbviewer is `nbconvert --to html` as a service, so it passes raw cells through to the HTML document [1].  _No processing should ever be done on the content of a raw cell._ If you want a block of unformatted text in nbconvert output, that is what a `pre` tag or code block is for, either in a markdown cell, raw (HTML) cell, or HTML output.\n\nRaw cells are a case where there is a clear differentiation between the live notebook as an authoring environment, and nbconvert as a rendered output. Raw cells are rendered the way they are in the live notebook because they are principally for authoring content that the live notebook cannot render (most logically latex or rst).\n\n> This would be very handy for documenting how to make notebooks\n\nProbably better would be to use code blocks in markdown, which can have highlighting, etc.\n\nFor example:\n\n``````\n```python\ndef foo():\n    \"\"\"this is some Python\"\"\"\n```\n``````\n\nproduces\n\n``` python\ndef foo():\n    \"\"\"this is some Python\"\"\"\n```\n\n[1]: if the raw cell is marked with a mime-type other than HTML, it will be omitted from HTML output.\n"

We were documenting the markdown, showing what you type, and then what you get. For that, `<pre>` and fenced blocks don't work so well because they don't wrap very nicely.\n\nBut we have found a workaround: if we use `<tt></tt>` then we get very close to what you see in the Raw cell in live notebook in both the live view and in nbviewer: it wraps nicely, and doesn't format the code in any other way.\n\nThanks for the information!\n"
