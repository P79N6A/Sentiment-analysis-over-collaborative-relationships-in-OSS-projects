The user should get a message that says something like:\n\n> You have attempted to connect to an IPython Cluster but no Controller could be found.  Please double-check the configuration of your profile and ensure that a cluster is running.  See http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/parallel/parallel_process.html for more information (repeat error)\n\nAlso, those docs should start with the very simple example (use cluster tab, use ipcluster) and then dive into more details later.\n"
