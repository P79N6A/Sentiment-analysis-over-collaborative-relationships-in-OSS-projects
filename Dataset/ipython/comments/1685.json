And it would be good, but not essential, to be able to test an unmergeable branch (i.e. check it out, rather than merging it). It could probably also use some cleanup, the code's a bit rough and ready at the moment. I won't be able to do any more until tomorrow evening UK time, so you're welcome to carry on with it in the meantime.\n\nI should have mentioned in the last comment - it now requires requests and keyring to be installed.\n"
