I meant to close the old pull request and in fact clicked the button to do so but was apparently the victim of a network hiccup.

    "body": "OK, looking at the code I think I understand better.  But I'm not convinced we should add more input handling logic of this kind.  Basically, I think if someone types `foo()`, then they mean a python call, not a magic.  Granted, it may take a little bit to realize that ipython offers two overlapping systems, one for \"commands\" (magics) and one for pure python code, but anyone using a tool like ipython should figure that out pretty quickly.\n\nNow, as for #342, I think we can address that one slightly differently, but I need to play with some ideas.\n\nBut I'm reluctant to add even more text input special-casing, as much of our code on that front is already fairly brittle.  What do you think?\n"
