I may be going a little crazy, but now I'm getting this:\n\n```\n>>> a = 1\n>>> a\n1\n>>> a\n>>> 1\n```\n\ni.e. the 2nd time I type `a` to get it to print out, it prints its value after a prompt. Hitting ESC clears it, and then it prints properly for the next try or two, before it prints incorrectly again. Seems somewhat random how often it occurs.\n"
