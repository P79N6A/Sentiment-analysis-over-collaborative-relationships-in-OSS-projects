    "body": "> no syntax change in the hackpad from the last dev meeting mean remove the tagged comment stuff :smile:? \n\nYes, it was decided it was too much of a specific syntax to be added. We don't want to add \"just one small thing\" or otherwise they will pile-up. We will come to a mechanism to deal with citation or things like that, but we need something more generic than thoses tags comment. Brian has some ideas about that, which should also bind nicely with the literate computing and beeing able to reference variable values in markdown cell.\n"

Better communicate the \"new\" [marked](/chjj/marked)  markdown syntax (docs and example notebooks) - includes tables!\n\nOptional workaround (not to prefered):\n- Similar it is currently done with js, extract_math | md2html | html2latex | insert_math\n\nNote: Many html attributes will not be handled correctly (whatever approach we will finally use) including width, height as these are not captured by pandoc.\n"
