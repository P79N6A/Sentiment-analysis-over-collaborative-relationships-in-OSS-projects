    "body": "I talked over with @minrk a bit what the interface should look like, and we reckoned that it should have a Python class that you can subclass and extend with your own tests. Then we might also want a declarative format for filling in values for the standard tests - like the JSON specifications you wrote - but we're less sure about that. It might be simpler just to always have people write Python files with a few lines of boilerplate.\n\nBased on what I've added so far, you use it like this (testing the R kernel here):\n\n``` python\nimport unittest\nimport kerneltest\n\nclass IRkernelTests(kerneltest.KernelTests):\n    kernel_name = \"ir\"\n\n    language_name = \"R\"\n\n    code_hello_world = \"print('hello, world')\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\nYou can just run that file with Python, or use something like nose or py.test if you want to include it in a larger Python test suite. I've already discovered one [bug](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel/commit/ab3893b71f8065222aca816acd182a75e4034ecd) in IRkernel by doing this. :-)\n"

    "body": "Here's an example from the JSON-LD project: this [format](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/pyld/blob/master/tests/runtests.py#L346), is used to generate something like [this report](http://json-ld.org/test-suite/reports/). Of course, we can't reuse tests like they do, as every kernel's inputs and outputs will be different, but having a shared vocabulary for \"it does the thing\" is good.\n\nAs I mention over on that proposal, I think it's important that when a kernel author cuts a new release, it is a matter of submitting a PR to the registry with a single changed value (version, url, sha, tag, script, whatever) from which we can reproduce the tests, etc. and present which features are tested (and therefore implemented). There's really no way to know that now other than reading [each kernel home page](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython-kernels-for-other-languages).\n\nThis is akin to the way the current base IPython Dockerfile tests itself as the last step before running: this is great for categorically knowing _the tests pass_, but doesn't give any information as to _what features were tested_, which is the important thing to manage across kernels.\n"
