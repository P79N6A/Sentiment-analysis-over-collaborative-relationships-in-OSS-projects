    "body": "To expand a bit: we actually did use `~/.config/ipython` for a while, but we decided to switch back to `~/.ipython` because:\n1. Consistency across platforms is more important to us than following the XDG spec. We refer to this location a lot in our docs, and answering questions people ask, and it's nice to be able to just say 'it's in ~/.ipython/blah'.\n2. We were never properly following the XDG spec anyway - we stuffed everything into config, including files that belonged in data, cache and runtime. We're not interested in refactoring our code to split these things out into separate directories.\n3. This is not a battle that it looks like the XDG is winning ([screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/327925/3446381/1e95e9da-0141-11e4-95d7-7127ac61b3a8.png)).\n\nYou can achieve the same effect as what we used to by setting $IPYTHONDIR to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ipython`.\n"
