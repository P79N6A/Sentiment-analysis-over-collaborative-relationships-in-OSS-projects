    "body": "Hi, Thanks for the proposition, \nA few comment though. \n\n> Notebook title.\n\nWell, right now notebook don't have \"title\". We are considering it, but there are other difficulties linked with doing that.\n\nIn particular this might lead to changing the notebook format which leads to incompatibility so need to be done with care.\n\n> Notebook file path.\n\nI (personally) would try to avoid adding more assumption that things are on a filesystem, there are backend that are DB based. \n\n> A fixed-height side pane consisting of two tabs:\n\nWe are thinking on bringing back a side panel.\n\n> MiniMap tab: similar to Sublime Text minimap, showing the structure of the document using Heading cells.\n> That would be great, but not easy to add, unless you know how to do that :-)\n> \n> Notebooks tab: a tree-view of the notebooks in the current directory (including subdirectories). Clicking on each notebook either opens it in a new tab or goes to its tab if it is already open.\n\nNo way to list the all tree that would be too much expensive server side as the tree could be potentially infinitively deep. Also the with won't be sufficient to see the full filenames of a tree.\n\n> MiniMap area - working as a TOC. Clicking on any part of the MiniMap will navigate notebook to that section.\n> Green horizontal line showing the location of the last executed cell.\n> Current view. The light gray box shows the location of the current view in the notebook.\n> General info, like last edit and memory usage by this notebook.\n> \n> \"No nbconvert\" checkbox prevents nbconvert to include this cell in the latex files. Useful when converting to latex to prevent the inclusion of large pure-code sections.\n\nTo much of a \"Niche\" use-case, we already have celltoolbar hightly customisable, with custom checkbox.\nThey are in the same place though, so we are converging on this one.\n\n> Collapse this cell and the corresponding output.\n\nDue to different and complicated issues, sadly,  we cannot add that into the live notebook. \n\nLots of good ideas, I think there are some things that are a little too specific for your use case, which is always difficult to judge. A few things would be hard to implement for technical reasons. \n\nI suppose most of what you ask would be doable as extension, if it is not we would gladely add the hook necessary for it to work. Prototype would be nice at least to find the relevant javascript library that would help. \nI think one of the limiting factor is that we are closing in on what we can get out of javascript. So unless we can have bandwidth to start optimising our current architecture, such an UI would rapidly become difficult to use.\n\nIf you are interested, I suppose you can have a look at [lens](http://lens.elifesciences.org/00778/#figures/paragraph_51/figure_1) that provide your minimap + color see how difficult it would be to integrate into notebook.\n"

    "body": "Thanks for your comments! My suggestions were purely from a user perspective and your comments helped me better understand what is technically feasible.\n\nIn particular:\n- I'm glad that you liked the minimap idea! The elife lens that you mentioned is very close to what I had in mind. \n- About Notebook view, I was thinking to use it mostly to navigate to the already opened notebooks. \n  -  For parsing deep-folders contents, I was thinking to have the tree view to show the content of each directory on request. e.g. don't parse the folder's contents unless the user clicked on that folder, and therefore avoid visiting potentially-infinite subdirectories. However this still might not be straightforward to implement.\n- I didn't know that collapsible input cells are not possible in the live notebook. I was really hoping the opposite :), maybe because I typically experiment with long scripts in IPython, which make the notebook very long.\n- I'm curious about the side-panel comeback and what it might include.\n\nI agree that most of the suggested features that have a chance to be technically possible (minimap in particular) best fit to a plugin (maybe in custom.js). I see if I can give the minimap idea a shot as a plugin.\n\nThanks again!\n"

    "body": "- 'No nbconvert' checkbox - we discussed at the dev meeting having a system to add arbitrary tags to cells, and one set of tags we considered was e.g. `exclude-latex`, `only-html`, etc., for getting nbconvert to drop certain parts. It's not quite as easy as a checkbox, but it opens a lot more possibilities with one piece of UI.\n- Sidebar: we're planning to add an outline view somewhere in the UI, to make working with long notebooks easier. A sidebar is one option for that. It probably wouldn't be the 'minimap' graphical view, just a simple list of headings.\n"

    "body": "These things are still under discussion, but here is my sense of the broad sense of things:\n- We are not considering adding notebook listing capabilities to the Notebook page.\n- We are _thinking_ about adding a sidebar, but only very weakly. In fact I would describe the current thinking more along the lines of \"let's avoid adding a sidebar at all possible costs, but we might have to give in eventually.\"\n- Our current direction for \"additional content\" is more in the direction of modal popups. That is how @minrk has implemented his TOC and all of the new widgets support that.\n\nOur resistance to some of these things has to do with a general design sensibility that we have. Namely, that when a user is working with the Notebook, it should basically be just their content. We want the few UI element that we add to the page to be extremely subtle, minimal, out of the way. _Almost_ a zen mode. This is why we are so strongly resisting a sidebar.\n\nPart of the issue is that with the new widget stuff that is about to be merged, we are going to enable users to put many more UI elements on the page. It will be very easy to create notebooks that start to look very busy in the UI. This requires us to keep the rest of the page as minimal as possible.\n\nNote, that doesn't in any way mean that someone can't develop a notebook extension that adds a sidebar for docking widgets, TOC, notebook list, etc. I just don't think we will ship it with IPython anytime soon.\n"
