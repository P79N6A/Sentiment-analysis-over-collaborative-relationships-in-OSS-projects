    "body": "The odds are slim that IPython is actually the cause, since IPython itself has no compiled code.\n\nSome more questions:\n- are you just doing `--pylab` or specifying a backend with `--pylab qt` or `--pylab tk` or `--pylab gtk`? If you are doing auto, please try with explicit backends, and see which one fails.\n- also try with the `%pylab qt` magic after starting IPython, to ensure the behavior is the same.\n- can you run it in a debugger and show what C call is segfaulting?\n"

These are the two outputs:\n- [valgrind](http://pastebin.com/8gPuQbnq)\n- strace, quite big, separated into four parts: [part I](http://pastebin.com/afQ3w171), [part II](http://pastebin.com/QYpsr6n7), [part III](http://pastebin.com/1dMiRDW6), [part IV](http://pastebin.com/1urWV9NL)\n\nThis stuff is all alien language to me, but I guess only the last strace file (out of the four) will maybe contain relevant information.\n"
