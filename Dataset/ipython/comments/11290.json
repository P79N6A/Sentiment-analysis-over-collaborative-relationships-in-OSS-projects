Conf.py [already detect stable/dev](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blame/master/docs/source/conf.py#L82-L93), we used to remove the develpement entry by hand but now it [_should_ be automatic] (https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blame/master/docs/source/whatsnew/index.rst#L18-L37) (I see you saw the code).\r\n\r\nI see I missed something [in build_release](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/commit/2a62b70caecaac834be8b02149f6dd985b73d76c) but you found it, I guess we can remove this check now.\r\n\r\nThanks for going through the release process. Is beta 1 out now ? "
