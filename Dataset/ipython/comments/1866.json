This means that when any single SVG modifies styles, those changes are propagated to the rest.  One solution is to encode SVGs the same way PNGs and JPEGs are, as base64 encoded data chunks, and add them to an `<img>` tag.\n\nI've followed this approach here, and it now renders correctly:\n\nhttps://github.com/stefanv/ipython/tree/svg_as_image_blob\n\nThe above changes made me realize that there's special casing and duplicate code for png/jpeg, so we may want to look at cleaning that up as well eventually.\n"

Unfortunately as I pointed out to @stefanv, I'm not sure encoding is a good idea: it seems to kill the scriptability support of SVG, and that would immediately rule out things like interactive d3.js figures.  That sounds like throwing away the baby with the bathwater.\n\nWe should try to find a solution to this that doesn't preclude things like interactive d3.js svg objects.  @minrk, you know a lot about graphics stuff, any thoughts on this front?\n"

    "body": "This annoys me so I have looked a bit into this issue. \nYet I'm not sure this is a priority right now given http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/ipython-dev/2012-June/009754.html\n\nA simple test reproducing the problem is \n\n``` html\n<html>\n<head>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n    <!-- First inline SVG with inline style block -->\n    <svg width=\"10cm\" height=\"5cm\" viewBox=\"0 0 1000 500\">\n    <defs>\n    <style><![CDATA[\n\n        rect {\n            fill: red;\n            stroke: blue;\n            stroke-width: 3\n        }\n        ]]></style>\n    </defs>\n    <rect x=\"200\" y=\"100\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\"/>\n    </svg>\n\n    <!-- Second SVG -->\n    <svg width=\"10cm\" height=\"5cm\" viewBox=\"0 0 1000 500\">\n    <rect x=\"200\" y=\"100\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\"/>\n    </svg>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nBoth rectangles are red because the style of the first svg leaks into the second svg.\nThis is correct according to the w3c specification at http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/styling.html#Scope\nwhich reads:\n\n> Stand-alone SVG content textually included in an XML document\n> There is a single parse tree, using multiple namespaces; one or more subtrees are in the SVG namespace. Style sheets defined anywhere within the XML document (in style elements or style attributes, or in external style sheets linked with the style sheet processing instruction) apply across the entire document, including those parts of it in the SVG namespace. To get different styling for the SVG part, use the ‘style’ attribute, or put an ‘id’ on the ‘svg’ element and use contextual CSS selectors, or use XSL selectors.\n\nSo what can we do about it ? I have explored the following solutions:\n\n1) Wrap the svg into an `img` or `object` tag. The inconvenient, as mentioned by @fperez, is that we loose the nice xml representation of the svg. \n\n2) Wrap the svg in an `iframe` as mentioned by @Carreau. The inconvenient is that we have to serve the svg data from another url.\n\n3) One could imagine injecting the style using javascript after the css is computed for the other elements.\n     Yet from what I've looked, it seems it's not possible to change the inline style attribute using javascript.\n\n4) One could follow the w3c recommendation and add an unique id selector per svg figure in front of every inline style rule. This would provide a unique namespace for each svg figure. The problem is that this requires parsing the css inline block which seems hard and error prone.\n\n5) Resetting the css adding a set of default css rules before each style block is very hard because of css inheritance rules.\n\n6) The ideal solution would be to use the `<style scoped >` html 5 extension. (http://www.w3.org/TR/html-  markup/style.html#style.attrs.scoped). The scoped  attribute  restricts the css scope to be local.\n\nI think approach 6 is probably the more elegant one. The problem is that scoped is planned but not yet included into SVG2 specification (http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/styling.html#Scope). Also html scoped is\nstill very experimental and not supported in major browsers.\n\nI have successfully experimented the following approach:\n- extract the inline style attribute from the svg and wrap it into an enclosing div using <style scoped>\n- use this Jquery plugin (https://github.com/thingsinjars/jQuery-Scoped-CSS-plugin) which adds support\n  for style scoped to current browsers\n\nUsing this the above code would become:\n\n``` html\n<html>\n    <head>\n        <script src=\"http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js\"></script>\n        <script src=\"jquery.scoped.js\"></script>\n    </head>\n\n    <body>\n\n    <div>\n        <style scoped >\n            rect {\n                fill: red;\n                stroke: blue;\n                stroke-width: 3\n            }\n        </style>\n\n        <svg width=\"10cm\" height=\"5cm\" viewBox=\"0 0 1000 500\">\n        <defs>\n        </defs>\n        <rect x=\"200\" y=\"100\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\"/>\n        </svg>\n    </div>\n\n        <svg width=\"10cm\" height=\"5cm\" viewBox=\"0 0 1000 500\">\n        <rect x=\"200\" y=\"100\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\"/>\n        </svg>\n\n    <script>\n        $.scoped();\n    </script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nwhich renders correctly.\n\nAnother maybe more pragmatical solution would be to embed svg into an iframe or object for now, and use inline svg when browsers are ready.\n\nWhat do you think ?\nIs there any interest in fixing this issue now or should we wait for the svg support to mature ?\n\nThanks,\n\nPablo\n"

    "body": "Actually, I realized #4236 does not fix the initial issue (rendering https://github.com/jonathan-taylor/ipython/tree/Rdevice). My reduced test case is too simple and possibly exhibits a different problem. Something else is going on with the original example, but I have no clue for the moment. \n\nEDIT:\n\nIt seems the initial issue  in https://github.com/jonathan-taylor/ipython/tree/Rdevice is not due to style leaks, but to `xlink:href` reused identifiers.\n\nThe SVG spec allows to reuse elements defined inside a `<defs>` section by inserting a `<use>` element (http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#UseElement).\n\nThe `use` element references the origin element  thanks to a `xlink:href` attribute.\nFor example: \n\n``` html\n <defs>\n    <rect id=\"MyRect\" width=\"60\" height=\"10\"/>\n  </defs>\n  ...\n  <use x=\"20\" y=\"10\" xlink:href=\"#MyRect\" />\n```\n\nThe problem in the `rmagic_extension.ipynb` notebook is that different SVG figures are redefining the same `ids`.\nTherefore the `xlink:href` has multiple targets. \n\nMaking the `ids` and `xlink:href` unique (for example prepending a unique hash) solves the issue.\n\nNevertheless this is getting hairy, maybe wrapping the svg in an img/iframe/object is the best option for now ?\n"

    "body": "@stefanv:\n\n> Another option could be to parse the SVGs and replace IDs with some image specific identifier + the old ID.\n\nAt first I though this was the way to go (see ~11 comments above :) ), but now I think it's a bad idea because:\n\n1)  It has the same downside that the iframe, it breaks interaction from other elements in the page such as global CSS or Javascript. That is because the CSS ID rules do not match anymore, and the Javascript cannot\naccess the elements anymore, because the IDs have been dynamically rewritten. \nAt least with the iframe solution we can embed d3.js code or CSS rules in the\niframe and they still work on the SVG.\n\n2) The implementation is much more error prone and costly than the iframe: it requires parsing the SVG and there are many tricky cases for IDs.\n"
