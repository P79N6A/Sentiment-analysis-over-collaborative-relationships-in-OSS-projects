    "body": "The hack was originally introduced when IPython.nbconvert was an standalone app... \nSurprisingly, I have tested your branch I do not  see the problem anymore. The problem was essentially a bad rendering of the math symbols, and it had a random nature (a kind of heisenbug), only fixed by the hack of loading mathjax at the very end...\nAnyway a lot of things changes, not only in IPython.nbconvert, but also in reveal.js, and the bug seems to be gone.\nTo conclude +1 to merge this one... because I can not replicate the problem anymore (which is a great notice, btw).\nThanks for start the discussion and \"force\" me to check this again :wink: \n"
