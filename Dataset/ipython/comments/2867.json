    "body": "It looks like this is still a problem. After you restart the server, a dialog pops up asking if you want to reconnect the WebSockets. Clicking yes appears to work, but the same dialog shows up again a bit later. The problem is that the kernel isn't running. One solution would be to automatically start a kernel if a WebSocket conection attempt is made and the kernel is not running. But that would be a very, very bad security risk, so we are not going to do that.\n\nThe best solution at this point is to trigger a page reload if the WebSocket reconnection logic detects that the kernel is not running. Shouldn't be too difficult.\n"
