Key quote:\n\n> The WebSocket Protocol [RFC6455] requires a new transport connection for every WebSocket connection.  This presents a scalability problem when many clients connect to the same server, and is made worse by having multiple clients running in different tabs of the same user agent.  This extension provides a way for separate logical WebSocket connections to share an underlying transport connection.\n"
