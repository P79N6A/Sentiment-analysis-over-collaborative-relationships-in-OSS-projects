In contrast, the plotting functions in the grid system return objects. This object-oriented nature is what makes ggplot2 work so well---complicated graphics can be built in an intuitive fashion because each function is returning objects that can be combined via overloaded addition operators. grid graphics aren't painted to the output device until the `print()` method is called on the object.\n\nThe source of confusion is that the native R REPL (i.e. the thing that people play with when using the R GUI or the R command line interface) implicitly calls `print()` on the result of every computation. When running R programs outside of the official REPL, such as through RScript or in this case rpy2, the calls to `print()` must be explicitly added by the programmer in order to get code that works the same way.\n\nThis is true for several R objects, but is especially noticeable with grid graphics.\n\n-Charlie\n"

    "body": "> Ah. It'd be nice if there was an option in R to behave like the REPL,\n\nWell... you could load up the [evaluate](https://github.com/hadley/evaluate) package and use its `evaluate` function to execute R code instead of the standard `eval`. But it seems to me that this is a bit like throwing a rug over a landmine to hide it instead of posting a big warning sign that lets everyone know it is there. Also, the system wouldn't work \"out of the box\" with a vanilla R installation---the evaluate package would need to be installed.\n\nHowever, several high-profile and well-written packages, such as [knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr), use this strategy to make things behave like the R REPL so there is some value to striving for consistency.\n"
