A reason to keep it in would be if we wanted to have a preference for a specific kind of font, and use monospace as a fall back, but as is, the font-monospace we have for `code` and `pre` that comes from style.css now is still redundant (i.e. removing it from there still keeps the resulting styling the same as it is now).\n"

It only touches a few redundant places that should never have had their own specification.\n\nThe cases removed here never had any effect in IPython, but they do have an effect (the wrong one) when embedding notebooks in a surrounding context, which may specify a different font-family for code.\n\n> A reason to keep it in would be if we wanted to have a preference for a specific kind of font, and use monospace as a fall back\n\nThis is already how CSS works, just add:\n\n``` css\npre, code {\n    font-family: \"My favorite mono font\", \"My second favorite\", monospace;\n}\n```\n"
