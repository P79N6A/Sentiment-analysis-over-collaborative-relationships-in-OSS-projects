There's no good reason to use either of these as cell magics without a body.\n\nIf we decide to go with the warning message, I think it could be a bit clearer. 'Empty cell' isn't very clear: even if the user knows our terminology of 'cells', the cell as a whole isn't empty, just the cell part of the cell magic, which they shouldn't have to know about.

Say someone does `%%sx ls` - now they expect `%%sx` to run the line. However, as soon as they run \n\n```\n%%sx ls\necho foo\n```\n\n`ls` does nothing. Granted, it's probably not a case that would come up very often, so I'll defer to your decision on this on. I'm adding a commit for the previously mentioned changes -- do with it as you will ;-)\n"
