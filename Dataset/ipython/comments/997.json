    "body": "I think the code is fine as-is, and since we're drowning in pull requests and this is really critical, I'm merging.  We can fine-tune the behavior regarding SystemExit later on if we really find it necessary, but I honestly think we're fine as-is.  It will catch a SystemExit and disable the registered function, which sounds pretty reasonable.\n\nThe important fix is handling sigint correctly, which I failed to take into account when I first wrote that code.  Thanks!\n\nI'll rebase to avoid the recursive merge and will push in a sec.\n"
