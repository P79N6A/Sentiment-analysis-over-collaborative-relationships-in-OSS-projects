We can show this in other locations.\n\nThis can be done via kernel_info in the about screen. And anyway with custom.js and PR in progress project will be able to fill the help menu with all the link they want to the current kernel.\n"

I guess I shouldn't do visual design work at that hour. \n\nThanks a million for trying out these different things! Now I really owe you a beer. As we do UI work, I think it is super important for us to try and keep open minds and simply try different things out. Often, after looking at different options, my feelings and thoughts change.\n\nBased on your experiments here are my current thoughts:\n- I don't like the green.\n- I do like having a border around the \"Python 3 o\" as in your first attempt as it uses a clear visual heirarchy to indicate that those things are related.\n- Overall, I think the pencil icon for showing edit mode is almost useless. I would prefer a persistent \"tag\" style button with a capital \"E\" or \"C\".\n- I like the idea of having all UI elements in the notification area have consistent sytyling as well - having some in \"tag/button\" styles and others not doesn't make much sense.\n- I like the `o` on the right of \"Python 3\" and the `|` separator.\n\nCan you create one last example with these suggestions?\n"
