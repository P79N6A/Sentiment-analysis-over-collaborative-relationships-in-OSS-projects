    "body": "Yes, it would make a dependency on knitr which is installable with \"install.packages('knitr')\". I modified the code to check for knitr and use the original R magic if the package is not available. By default, it will use knitr, and emits a warning if it is not found.\n\nI thought that mimicking knitr's output would be attractive to R users in that knitr has replaced Sweave as a tool\nto generate \"rich\" documents with R.\n\nAs far as performance goes, I haven't tested it heavily so I don't have a good answer. In principle, I can't see a big loss, it would depend on how long knitr takes to evaluate a code chunk versus the regular R interpreter. If the code chunk is short and not producing huge numbers of outputs, I can't see how there would be a big hit. \n\nDoes anyone have an example of something knitr is very slow at?\n"

Generally speaking, installing R packages is very smooth.\n- I suppose it also wouldn't hurt to just have an additional magic %%knitR that has this functionality but I thought that might be adding too many magics.\n- It's not really functionality that will be lost, it is \"feel\". With something like the knitr version of the magic, it feels more like interacting with an R console.\n\nJonathan \n\nP.S.

    "body": "Playing with this PR a little, my first impression is that the error reporting from knitr is much better than that with the current IPython code.\n\nWith the old code, when you have a large block of R code with a syntax error, it's very hard to find your error. With this PR though, the messages are much better:\n\n```\nRRuntimeError: Error in parse(text = x, srcfile = src) : <text>:3:21: unexpected symbol\n2: p = ggplot(data.frame(x=x, y=x^2), aes(x,y))\n3: p = p + geom_line() syntax_error\n                      ^\n```\n\nFor me (an R novice that makes lots of bugs), this alone is a huge win.\n\n---\n\nThe PR mentions using `?` to get help, but I had a little trouble with that.

    "body": "Just testing this out:\n\nA few quibbles about the warning message about knitr - it's not clear to users who don't know what knitr is, the solution offered doesn't work in IPython, and the warning system produces ugly formatting. I suggest:\n\n```\nprint(\"To get the best output from R, we recommend installing knitr. You can do this in IPython with %Rinstall knitr\")\n```\n\nWithout knitr, simple things seem to work, but attempting a plot displays a big ugly traceback: https://gist.github.com/4478972 . The same plot works with the current implementation of rmagic.\n\nWith knitr, the plot works, and... %%R echoes the R code, then precedes each output line with `##`. I assume I'm missing something here? R exceptions still seem to come underneath a big Python traceback, and the `?` help has the same error that @rmcgibbo pointed out. I've uploaded the notebook so you can see what I tried: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/gist.github.com/raw/4479164/b432b905512a3407b71d9c6f12464ab641947533/knitr.ipynb\n\nAlso, don't forget that this needs rebasing on master. I've just checked, there are a couple of small conflicts that should be easy to resolve.\n"
