To see it on Mavericks, with either Homebrew or Anaconda python 3.4.1 and PyQt4, just start a console as above, then go away and do something elsewhere for a few minutes.  When you come back, chances are the session will be unusable because of delayed response to attempts to type or scroll through history.  It's somewhat erratic, but qualitatively repeatable.  In my case, testing is with a plain Apple terminal window (with focus follows mouse), not with ITerm2.\n"
