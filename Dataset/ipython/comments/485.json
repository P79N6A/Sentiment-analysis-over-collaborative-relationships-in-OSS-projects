    "body": "Hey Min,\n\nDoes IPython/config/profile/default/ipython_config.py in this pull request represent the official way that the terminal app will be configured in ipython-0.11? I'm thinking specifically of \"app.extensions\" vs the previous c.Global.extensions, I'm documenting how to enable a custom completer for h5py-1.4, which will be released soon. Will \"app.extensions\" also apply to ipython-qtconsole?\n"

    "body": "It should be, though it might change a bit after review.\nThe 'app.extensions' refers to 'c.IPythonApp.extensions', which is set at the top of the config file, so you can't rely on it being there in a custom config. \nSince the QtConsole doesn't have an App yet, I'm not certain.  If it's a subclass of IPythonApp, then it will inherit the config, but if it's not then it will need to be set by the qt app's name to affect it.  I'm looking at the qt code now, to see what the Apps should look like, and I'm not sure yet. It's a bit peculiar, because there will be two Apps - one for the Kernel and one for the frontend.\n"
