I was strongly opposed to not treating our users like consenting adults who can make that decision on their own, with the default being the safer disabling problematic output. The signing idea wasn't even verbalized at that time.\n\nWith that said - I think we'd be doing a great disservice to current users of the notebook if in 2.0 we did not ~~ship or~~ (oops, missed `ipython trust`) document for them a simple way to sign their pre-2.0 notebooks.\n\nIts a significant change that we should document for users.\n"
