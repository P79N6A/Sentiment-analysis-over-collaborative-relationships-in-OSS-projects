    "body": "The rst, markdown and latex converters all extract the images to separate files and put references to them in the file, as this is the normal way of including images in these documents. Only for HTML do we generate a single file with the images included inline, because it's much more common to view HTML in a web browser than to look at the raw code.\n\nIf you want rst/markdown with images embedded in base64 image tags, it should be possible to write your own exporter to do that. I don't think we're going to support it.\n"
