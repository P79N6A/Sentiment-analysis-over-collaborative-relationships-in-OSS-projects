    "body": "Just kidding - I wasn't diligent with my browser-refresh when switching branches.  Bad notebooks (written by 0.12) loaded in this branch will see the HTML markup as plaintext, because the content will be double-escaped on load.  Good notebooks (written by this branch) will be loaded unescaped (`[0;31m` in tact, output uncolored) in 0.12.\n\nOf course, everything should be safe, so the only thing needed when moving from one to the other is to re-run the notebook to generate the outputs with/without the bug so it matches the running frontend.\n\nI don't know if this is fixable, because the escaped HTML output is always perfectly valid as plaintext, so it's impossible to be certain about whether an extra escape should be made.\n\nNote that this is not related to the notebook format, but a bug in the notebook _frontend_, which puts the wrong information in plaintext fields.  However, one way to 'fix' the problem is to define this bug into the current notebook format, and increment the format with no changes. We then edit v2, and patch it to perform the escape/unescape around the files themselves.  I do not think this is worth it, but it is an option.\n\nPinging @ellisonbg as notebook format coder-in-chief.\n"

Obviously we'd also apply it to master.\n- keep going but try to stabilize very quickly so we can release 0.13 soon.\n\nI actually think I'd prefer the latter.  The notebook is so much nicer with the menus and the codemirror fixes we just merged, that I think it more than warrants being called 0.13.  We could consider making a release in a 2-3 week timeframe, which would also be ideal for PyCon.  Thoughts?\n"

    "body": "Great idea.  I also think that the new notebook is much nicer (polished) than the 0.12 one, and that releasing it soon and as 0.13 would be warranted.\n\nBTW: In case someone thinks that the polished appearance would be diminished by doubly-escaped HTML, how about detecting this and adding a notification (similar to modern browser’s \"do you want to save this password?\" bars at the top) suggesting to the user to re-evaluate all cells?  Again, I am not suggesting that it’s worth it, but just wanted to throw in the thought.\n"
