    "body": "@Carreau What can be done about this? I would very much like to get this fixed by IPython 3, because this is a pretty sucky UI for non-IPython kernels right now. \n\nSpecifically, I'd like to be able to use down for navigating through the autocomplete selection list, and ` `to trigger an info popup. However, right now, the two are linked, so either a) info popups never happen (because Haskell rarely uses`(` in that position) or b) you have to use Space to navigate the autocomplete selection list. How can we decouple these two behaviours? I am far from a Javascript guru, but if this is a simple fix I can make a PR to IPython; sadly I expect it would require more than anything too trivial :(, but I'm willing to give it a shot...\n"
