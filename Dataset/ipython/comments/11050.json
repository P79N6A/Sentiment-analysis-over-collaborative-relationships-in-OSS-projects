See https://bugs.python.org/issue27921.\r\n\r\nMy intention is to some day relax this condition, so as to at least allow `\\r`, `\\t`, `\\n`, etc. But it's not a straightforward problem, and depends on how people do (or don't) want to modify the lexer and parser to understand f-strings.\r\n\r\nI think this bug can be closed, as it's not an issue with ipython."
