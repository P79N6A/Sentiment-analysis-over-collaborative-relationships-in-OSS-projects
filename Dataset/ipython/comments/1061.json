    "body": "I think I have a solution, but it involves changing the pypy readline.raw_input(), not anything in ipython.  This raw_input() invokes the startup_hook before its reader.buffer is reset.  When the buffer is reset (in reader.readline() ), any readline.insert_text() action is lost.\n\nMy solution is to clear the buffer in readline.raw_input, and then hang onto the buffer contents when readline does its reset (self.prepare() ).  But I have make a new reader.readline method so I don't interfere with main pypy shell loop (which uses readline.multiline_input).\n\nIt was much easier to identify the problem by running the PyMOTW readline_hooks.py sample code than to wade through multiple levels of redirection and hook definitions in ipython.  :) \n"
