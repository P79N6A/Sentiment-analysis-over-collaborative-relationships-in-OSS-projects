    "body": "Hi @palob,\n\nThanks for the feedback.  In the context of IPython 2.0rc:\n\n> There is no 'Find/Replace' method for code editing.\n\nSee\n#3270\n\n> For there are no universal Comment/Uncomment , Indent/Unindent keyboard shortcuts: what about toolbar buttons for this functions?\n\nThese shortcuts already exist:\n`ctrl-/` toggles comments.\n`tab` and `shift-tab` indents and unindents blocks of text.\n\nHowever, we do not have toolbar buttons for them yet.\n\n> A 'toggle line numbers' applying to all cells keyboard shortcut/button would be helpful. By the same token a way to show the current column number would be helpful.\n\nThis doesn't exist yet, but I hope you are aware of `l` in command mode, which toggles line numbers in the selected cell.\n\n> When doing extensive inline plotting and using multiple cells in one document things can get confusing. What about a folding feature for code cells as well as for cell output?\n\nSee:\n#2284\n#4211\n\n> I propose adding basic shortcuts (e.g. Undo/Redo --> Ctrl+Z/Y) to the shortcut help.\n\n`x`, `c`, and `v` are already in the keyboard shortcut help for command mode.   They do not exist in the help for edit mode because of the same reason `insert`, `page-up`, etc are not included.\n\nCheers,\nJon\n"
