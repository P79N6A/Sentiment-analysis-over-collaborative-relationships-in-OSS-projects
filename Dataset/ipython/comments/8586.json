    "body": "Hi, \n\nDuplicate of many issues, we are aware, it is possible to change shortcut, though we are cornerd by some technicality web browser implementation that do not allow to distinguish keyboard layout, and even distinguish keys on keyboard layout. \n\nExample of remap :\n\n```\nIPython.keyboard_manager.command_shortcuts.remove_shortcut('Shift-k')\nIPython.keyboard_manager.command_shortcuts.add_shortcut('Cmd-minus','ipython.move-selected-cell-up')\n```\n\nProblem is on some layout in browser you will get the same event for `minus` and `star`, so there is sometime nothing we can do. \n"

Are these options documented somewhere?\n\nNot well, we haven't (yet) found a nice way to get docs. I'm trying on my own to write some [narrative docs](http://carreau.gitbooks.io/jupyter-book/content/keyboardshortcut.html) on how to do theses things, but right now it's still mostly [read the source](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/notebook/static/base/js/keyboard.js#L343-L364). \n\nWe are looking for people that would like to help with that, and will hopefully will find someone. \n\nWe will be also [giving a tutorial, with online material](https://github.com/jupyter/scipy-advanced-tutorial) at scipy in a couple of weeks, which deals, in part, with that. \n\nYou can also have a look at https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions that provide some custom keybindings for german keyboard. \n"
