When I use a fenced code block in a markdown block for C or C++ (i.e. three backticks, then `c++` on the same line then the code then three backticks again), this is rendered in the slides html as a `<pre>` block, thus showing the literal syntax highlighting HTML as reported above.\n\nIt would be great of `nbconvert` which probably normally translates three backticks to `<pre>`, would NOT do this if the three backticks are succeeded by a language identifier on the same line, i.e. a fenced code block.\n\nOutput of `sys_info()` is:\n\n```\n{'commit_hash': 'd87a8cd',\n 'commit_source': 'installation',\n 'default_encoding': 'UTF-8',\n 'ipython_path': '/home/cpbotha/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython',\n 'ipython_version': '2.2.0',\n 'os_name': 'posix',\n 'platform': 'Linux-3.13.0-35-generic-x86_64-with-debian-jessie-sid',\n 'sys_executable': '/home/cpbotha/anaconda/bin/python',\n 'sys_platform': 'linux2',\n 'sys_version': '2.7.8 |Anaconda 2.1.0 (64-bit)| (default, Aug 21 2014, 18:22:21) \\n[GCC 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-1)]'}\n```\n"
