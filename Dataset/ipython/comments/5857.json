    "body": "The relevant issues:\n- The kernel relies on the context of an execute_request to forward raw_input to the requesting frontend.\n- Arguments like `-m` are just forwarded to the kernel, and ignored by the qtconsole.\n- Therefore, the kernel executes the script without the usual parent_header, forwarded input context, so it doesn't send raw_input to the frontend.\n\nI think the fix for this would be for frontends to intercept and interpret `-m` and `script.py` arguments, and send them to the kernel as execute requests, rather than letting the kernels run them at startup.\n"
