    "body": "Ok, I am almost done with the first draft of this. The only thing I haven't done is the mimetype stuff, which I am a little unsure about. Here are some questions that I have so far:\n1. Does `prompt_number` need to be included in `execute` output? It seems a little redundant, since the output is already a child property of the cell, which has a `prompt_number` property. I agree with preserving the distinction between \"result\" and \"side effect\" (as discussed in IPEP 13), but this can still be maintained just by the output type (either `execute_output` or `display_data`).\n2. What should go in `kernel_info`?\n3. What is the `format` property in raw cells supposed to be for?\n4. Currently, the schema for `execute_output` is too specific -- e.g., it has specific properties for `text`, `html`, `javascript`, and `png`. Is the idea supposed to be that this outputs can have any number of \"extra\" keys that correspond to different data mimetypes (html/javascript/png/etc.)? An easier way to handle this in the JSON schema would be to have a property for `mimetype` and then a property for `data` or something like that, rather than a key which is the mimetype itself. But, maybe this would cause other issues?\n5. Should the output types (except `error`) always have a `text` property?\n6. I created schemas for execute, stream, and error outputs. Execute includes both actual execute (formely pyout) and `display_data`. Did I miss any others?\n"

    "body": "Ok, just updated the spec so it correctly handles mimetype keys now. The way I ended up doing this is with `patternProperties`, which lets you specify a regex that property names have to match. The only thing that isn't really fully covered by this is that it doesn't enforce that raw outputs like pngs should just be a string, and stuff like text should be a list of strings -- it just says it has to be an array or a string. I'm not sure if enforcing that is very important in the long run.\n\nBut, as per the dev meeting today, we should think about this some more (especially with regards to where the output metadata goes).\n\nI will push some changes for the IPEP 20 stuff shortly.\n"

So, I can't just have a type that says \"string\" or \"array of strings\".\n\nI think I would be able to do this in the JSON schema v4 using the new [oneOf](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-validation.html#anchor88) keyword. Maybe we should switch to using the new v4 schema when we update nbformat as well, since we want to do that eventually anyway?\n"
