    "body": "Are you getting these tests run by a simple `iptest`?  I think `IPython.zmq` is still in our exclusions list... If I run it manually via `iptest IPython.zmq`, I get dropped into an interactive editor a couple of times... It seems that the `zmq` subpackage has a couple of nasty tests in it and maybe initially we just punted and disabled the lot.  As part of this PR, we should fix that so that `iptest` picks up all of `IPython.zmq` for testing as well...\n"

But let's merge this as-is, you did a terrific job and I'm thrilled to have zmq and messaging test coverage; we can fine-tune things later as needed.\n"
