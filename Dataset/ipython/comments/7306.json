However the screenshots do look good. Have you considered placing the loading icon to the left of the cell? My first idea was that you could just replace `In[*]` with a spinner such as the one you placed below, but I don't know how that would end up. Thanks for working on this, I can't wait to see what this ends up with :)\n"

It indicates that you are waiting for something in the prompt area, while here it indicates clearly that you are waiting for a result. \n\nI'll play with it though. \n"
