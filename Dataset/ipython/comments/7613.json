    "body": "This has been addressed since merging of #7505 (new UI). \n\n![New UI](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3292874/5843785/ce28d610-a163-11e4-92bf-395469ac5fcf.png)\n\nThe only difficulty that remains is to see exactly which notebooks are running. There were some nice ideas (which I believe were somehow postponed in favor of more important discussions) like:\n\n> One idea, which I hesitate to try, is to color the notebooks if they are running - maybe green.\n> Another, use a different icon, like an open notebook or the logo of the kernel.\n> Another, display a second icon, either or the left or right side of the row, which indicates the notebook is running. This icon could be the kernel logo, to additionally indicate what type of kernel is running.\n\nTo me having the kernel logo (or an open notebook icon in absence of a logo) would be a great indicator of a notebook \"running\".\n"
