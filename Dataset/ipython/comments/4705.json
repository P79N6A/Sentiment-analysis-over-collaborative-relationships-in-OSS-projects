    "body": "I don't think there is any reason not to allow a wider tooltip. \nMaybe with a min-width instead of a width (not sure what is used now). IIRC there might have been issues because of scrollbar, but we could re-test. The scrollbar might also explain  the 72 char behavior has most of us code on Macs+Chrome  where the scrollbar is invisible so we have a few more pixel to prevent wrap. \n\nWould like like to give it a shot in a PR ?\n"

    "body": "I think @Carreau is right - it's calculating the div width based on the width of the content, then adding a scrollbar, which subtracts from the actual available width. If only browsers were good at math :(.  I think fixing that calculation to add enough horizontal space for the scrollbar should solve the issue. I expect that's stupidly complicated compared to how it should be, so maybe setting min-width to 80 chars + scrollbar width is the way to go.\n"
