    "body": "I'm pretty sure I did it via **conda**. I'm a little confused, though, because while conda lists, for example, ipython-qtconsole & spyder-app as being outdated, when I run `pip list -o` neither of those are listed.\n\nAnother thing has been confusing me:\n- When I try to use conda to update ipython-qtconsole, it lists \"ipython-2.0.0\" as one of the packages to be unlinked while \"ipython-1.1.0\" is among those that will be linked (thus, I haven't actually run the command since the result doesn't much sound like an \"update\").\n\nThe point is that it is entirely possible that I (somehow) only partially downloaded the new ipython update. There is (clearly) a lot about, well, _computers_, that I don't know about (for instance,  why pip and conda tell me different packages are outdated (something about having two different paths, I imagine)...).\n\nAnyway, thanks for your response--I wasn't sure if this was the right outlet for my issue (especially considering that I didn't exactly know what my issue was about in the first place...).\n\nHave any suggestions??\n"

Both conda and pip should have IPython 2 available now.\n"
