    "body": "Right now, there are no easy way to change the behavior. \nDepending on how much you want to dive in the code, the possibility are : \n- Having visible tabs (to distinguish tab/space)\n- indenting with tab instead of space\n- filter the cell to convert tab <-> space before sending to kernel.\n\nThe first 2 are just one line codemirror options that have to be added in the right place.\n\nJust to be sure, when using the notebook, you get tabs in the codecell, right ? \nHow does that happend ? When you press tab ? Or copy and past ? Because IIRC tabkey  should never insert tab characters in notebook, but should add/remove space until the next multiple of 4.\n\nOr indent/dedent is something is selected, or trigger tooltip or completion, but this is a detail.\n"

    "body": "Python either allows tabs or spaces for indentation.  I prefer to use tabs.  When I cut and paste tab-indented code into iPython, how can I get the tab key on the keyboard to insert a tab character into a cell?   It appears by default with iPython that pressing tab on your keyboard inserts spaces into the cell.   Then when you execute the cell this causes Python to complain about indentation.  In the example below print statement was added in iPython and has space indentation while the other lines were copied from a pyCharm project with tab indentation.\n\n```\ngpstime_sec = gpstimesec_from_gpstimesow(gpsweek, gpssecofweek, verbose=verbose)\nprint 'gpstime_sec: {}'.format(gpstime_sec)\nreturn\n```\n\nFile \"<ipython-input-14-2ae6f2e9c274>\", line 10\n    print 'gpstime_sec: {}'.format(gpstime_sec)\n                                               ^\nIndentationError: unindent does not match any outer indentation level\n\nI think this is what vgoklani was trying to ask here.  \n"

    "body": "to each their own, but it is def a PITA that different editors, e.g., vi vs. jupyter, handle this differently (at least with my settings; it's not their fault) and then it later cause my Python code to barf.  if I were the king of Python I'd do something a little more intelligent there, like figuring out that when someone TABed they meant the same as when someone (invariably with carpal thumbal syndrome) typed 4 spaces.  i.e., whitespace.  that's what a human would do, right?  well, maybe not you high school language teacher, but reasonable humans would see that and say, oh, i get it.\r\n\r\npersonally, I don't understand why anyone would prefer to type exactly 4 spaces when they really mean 1 unit of indention, aka TAB.  esp. with a language like Python what will barf if you accidentally type 3 or 5.  that just seems unnecessarily complicated to me.  hit the damn TAB key and get on with it.\r\n\r\nall that said, as a sw eng with 40 years experience in zillions of languages, notably C/C++, it is really jarring to back to a non-Python (or Scala) language where I have to add semicolons and curly braces.  how quaint.\r\n\r\n(personally, I think Smalltalk had the best readability, but it is an acquired taste, like Lisp.)"
