Another example in LibreOffice similar to what we have (using tab and changing the font size):\n\n![output2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/599274/6858669/7a9d2230-d3d6-11e4-8556-51847779db86.gif)\n\nI don't think this is a bug. If you scroll down and leave your focus behind and then perform an action, the page will jump to show you the place in which the change took place. Otherwise, it would be confusing. The alternative would be to change focus as you scroll down, but that is not the standard behavior at all and would require a lot of events to keep track of the `innerWidth` and `innerHeight` of the `window` object. \n\nI think the only way to achieve this is replacing the cursor and use a `div` instead. That way, you have full control of the focus behavior. This is what Google Docs did when they rewrote the application from scratch. Keep in mind that they are using a `span` for each line in the document. However, Google Docs also jumps when you change something. It doesn't jump when a state changes (such as font-size), though.\n"

    "body": "From a quick test:\n- Simply entering command mode from edit mode still can trigger focus jump.\n- Clicking on the buttons in the toolbar doesn't cause a jump - it does fix that issue.\n\nBut...I think buttons should be buttons, not divs. Being forced on relying on button=div to fix this type of bug is not sustainable in the long run (just the accesibility issues alone, but also for writing semantic HTML). Plus, this doesn't really fix the underlying issues of focus that we have (some of the bugs remain and are unrelated to the buttons).\n"
