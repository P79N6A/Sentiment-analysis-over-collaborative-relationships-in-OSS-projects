The regex applies to the text in the buffer, which should be frontend agnostic.\n\nNot all frontend work the same way, a regex would probably be hard in a readline base one (or, readline has no tooltip). The point is that regex might not be sufficient, you might want more complex or more maintainable logic. \n\nThe fact that you have a tooltip is already frontend dependant. Spyder for example does open does not open a tooltip but have a side bar that show more info, with a behavior that can depend on context. \n\nI can clearly see the notebook tooltip+ completer evolving  to be a unified widget for which regex or keypress is not sufficient.\n\nThe kernelspec **folder** allow for more file, the notebook will already use a custom.js and a custom.css each frontend can accommodate a configuration file in it, emacs a .el file, atom a atom.js ... etc. I don't see any reason not to use it. \n"
