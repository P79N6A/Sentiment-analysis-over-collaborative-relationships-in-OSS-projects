    "body": "Yes, this is still true, but it isn't true that this is an IPython bug, or even an IPython issue at all.  Making these changes in IPython would mean that IPython would behave in a _different manner_ to other readline applications on the platform (e.g. bash).  A better answer for people who want readline on OSX to behave like readline on Linux is to add the corresponding lines to `~/.inputrc`.  This would change the behavior for _all readline applications_, including IPython.\n\nThe main remaining point is that history search could be bound to PageUp/Down instead of arrow Up/Down, which would be more standard (though not matching defaults on any system I have used, to my knowledge), and is purely a matter of preference. For me (and especially my PageUp-less laptop keyboard), history search is far too useful to be relegated to the incredibly inconvenient PageUp/Down by default, and if users want it that way, it's easy to change it.\n\nMarking this an an enhancement, since it's a style choice not a bug, but I'd actually recommend just closing this issue, as it really isn't for IPython, but readline on OSX in general.\n"
