It does seem like you addressed this issue already.\n\nHowever,\n1.  The current fix doesn't work if the IPython notebook server is\nrunning with HTTP but served behind an HTTPS proxy like\nnode-http-proxy, which is my current setup.\n2.  Running \"pip install ipython==dev\" pulls from SVN (\nhttp://ipython.scipy.org/svn/ipython/ipython/trunk ) rather than from\nGitHub, which is why I initially reported this issue.\n\nAt any rate, installing the local MathJax is working fine so thank you\nfor your work.\n"
