    "body": "-1 on this approach.\n\nI don't think we should be developing a generic scheme to build command line flags for the kernels. I also don't think most kernels should be using our profile directory. And I don't like having a variable called argv that's a dictionary.\n\nI think we should approach this by either:\n1. Passing `--profile-dir` only to IPython kernels. We already add some extra arguments for our own kernels - see `IPython.kernel.launcher.launch_kernel()`.\n2. Pass it as an environment variable, `IPY_PROFILE_DIR`. By established convention, things only look at environment variables they know about, so extra ones are completely ignored.\n"
