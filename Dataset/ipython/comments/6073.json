    "body": "I propose treating, initially, every metadata block, but eventually, each entire notebook, as [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org) documents. Basically, this means adding/fiating a [`@context`](http://json-ld.org/spec/ED/json-ld-syntax/20111016/#the-context) to every metadata block. Then adding some namespaces of linked data. Then starting to do useful stuff with it.\n\nJSON-LD provides a standards-based way to capture a much richer underlying structure to JSON data than JSON schema, for example. This \"linked data\" concept asserts that data has:\n- identity, `@id`\n- type, `@type`\n- as defined by a `@context`\n\nThe example above with the multiple affiliations is trivial, not only to write, but to actually do something with, as there exist parsers in most major languages. Further, the specific pidgen\n\nThe biggest initial win would be in selecting and promoting a few, existing, productive namespaces for 99% of the cases of metadata that someone might want.\n- The biggest player in this space is [dublin core](http://dublincore.org/). Scholarly. If I had to pick one, I'd probably just go with this.\n- The biggest challenger is [schema.org](http://schema.org), which is what powers, for example, Google Now, and that thing that lets you do stuff to github issues from inside gmail. For an SEO/internet citizenship point of view, this is very possibly the future.\n- The biggest vision is [W3C PROV](http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-primer/), which would actually contain the means to capture the complex relationship between multiple simultaneous users. and uses dublin core as a baseline.\n\nNow, the joke is that we could _claim_ that we are using all of them, as one can make their OWN term, then use ontology dark magic to claim the it is the same as other standards. For example, `jupyter:name` could be described to link to `rdfs:label`, `dc:title` and `schema:name`. However, i recommend against doing such a thing, aside from those places where we are really doing new things, i.e. ComputableDocument is a subclass of schema:CreativeWork. JupyterKernel is a subclass of schema:Software.\n\nLonger term, JSON-LD provides things like internationalization, out-of-band context and other features that would contribute substantially to the overall impact of the IPython/Jupyter ecosystem.\n\nSince the data-at-rest representation is still JSON, this introduces no real new challenges, but gives us a huge head start: we already have some great collections of concepts to pull in, rather than having to build the UI and the vocabulary at the same time.\n"

    "body": "> I think for the time being we need to be extremely conservative in not changing the notebook format.\n\nAgreed. That's one of the big advantages of JSON-LD: we can just _say_ that the notebook is now JSON-LD, as interpreted by a [particular context](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/bollwyvl/6edda34649ba4b5cbaf9#A-lightweight-@context-for-Notebook-Format-4), and it is. But there is still a lot of information missing... my motivation here is the seemingly simple [nbviewer](/jupyter/nbviewer/issues/92) [issues](/jupyter/nbviewer/issues/164), and influenced by making it work with, for example, [google drive](/jupyter/nbviewer/issues/427).\n\nA ContentManager is, in the end, is responsible for giving the notebook a URL. Heck, I like the [index.ipynb](/jupyter/nbviewer/issues/181) suggestion. But this suggests that the filename is a thing for machines, that the human might not even control. What is the name for people? At present, google is nice enough to pull an `h1` out of the content of notebooks, but an empty title is really pretty bad for humans to find it.\n\nI'm saying that _when_ we add \"real\" metadata for metadata's sake (that some robot from outside the ecosystem would actually recognize as such), JSON-LD would be the right way to capture it.\n\nSo that _when_ we enable populating the title of notebooks on nbviewer, even if it is to fall back to the filename, that someone should be able to override it. And _when_ they provide it, and maybe still in `dialog.js`, not only as hand-edited JSON, but they should be able to pick from a collection of vocabularies that provide value beyond their current browser or nbviewer.\n\nMy preferred solution for the UI/UX challenge would be, however, to move the ~~meta~~ linked data out of a dark modal, and put it in the main UI, much like Lyx. Being able to point to a cell and promote it to The Title, or The Abstract, and then have real formatting applied to it (`.jumbotron`, `blockquote`) and know that that would show up in google as the link title and excerpt would be very powerful.\n\n## Endgame\n\nLonger term, as was discussed on the list, really thinking about the Notebook document from the ground up as linked data would be incredible, and allow things like:\n- slide remixing\n- copy/paste with attribution\n- multiple human languages\n- publishing of discoverable data along with notebooks\n- and eventually... being able to use the ecosystem of notebooks as something computable... along the lines of the wolfram language\n"
