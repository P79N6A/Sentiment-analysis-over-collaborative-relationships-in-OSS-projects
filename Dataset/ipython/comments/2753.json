If we do local execution after remote, all n+1 execuctions will be concurrent.\n\nI chose 1., since I really intended this for interactive definitions, where the first choice is always preferable,\nbut if people are goind to use it for execution (would be weird, but not unlikely), then I suppose I should change to 2.\n"
