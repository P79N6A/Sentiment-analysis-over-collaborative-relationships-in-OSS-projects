    "body": "I think this is better than #7839 for the following reasons:\n1. in python, there really is an assumption of synchronous execution.  This is conceptually simpler than the #7839, as it just insists that all message handling be synchronous.  We already have messages deserialized synchronously; this makes the entire execution synchronous.\n2. It's simpler to reason about the payload handlers if they are also executing synchronously, and this also guarantees that if they return a promise, they are executed before the next messages are processed.  That's a nice thing to have.\n\nA message handler doesn't have to be synchronous, of course.  If it doesn't return a promise, we won't wait for it.  This just makes the default to wait for handling before trying to handle more messages.\n"
