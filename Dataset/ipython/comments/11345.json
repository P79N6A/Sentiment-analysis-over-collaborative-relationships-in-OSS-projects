    "body": "Well, when I run the ipython command I always get the Mac rocket icon, which I think it's triggered by the matplotlib GUI backend (I use the `osx` backend). This has been so for as long as I can remember and it also happens when I launch ipython 5.x with python 2.7. The difference is that in python 3 with ipython 7 the focus goes to the Python.app rocket icon and does not come back to the terminal, forcing me to regain the focus by clicking on the terminal or doing cmd+tab.\r\n\r\nI installed python 3.7.0 with pyenv on macOS 10.14."
