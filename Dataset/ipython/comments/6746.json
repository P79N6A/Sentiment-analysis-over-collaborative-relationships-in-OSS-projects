I can understand the annoying. You can open an issue on github.\n"

    "body": "It's quite the opposite of \"unconditional\". A root logger is only set up in the condition that:\n1. there is no IPython application running\n2. there is no root logger already configured\n\nIf you don't want your logs to go to the root logger, then the way to express that is to set `propagate=False` in your logger. If they should go to the root logger, you may want to configure a root logger, in which case `logging.basicConfig` is a no-op.\n"
