Only if one could change the error message to something meaningful that points to the solution, I would keep this issue open. But maybe this problem is too specific...\n\nThanks a lot for the quick answer!\n"

    "body": "Copying explanation from #6191:\n\n> IPython listens on localhost by default. 127.0.0.1 ought to behave the same, and does in almost all cases. Some cases where this can be handled differently include local proxies and/or firewalls (usually due to a configuration oversight, rather than an intentional difference in behavior). We have found cases where localhost works and 127 doesn't and vice versa, so there isn't an unambiguously correct answer for the default.\n> \n> Do you have a firewall and/or proxy configuration? If so, do you control its configuration? I would describe this behavior as a bug in your network setup, but it may not be one that you have permission to fix.\n"
