    "body": "First thing: `ipython --pylab=wx` fully specifies 'use pylab with wx backend and eventloop integration'.  `--pylab` is equivalent to `--pylab=auto`, and `--pylab=wx` implies `--gui=wx`.\n\nMy guess is there's something wrong when working with the inputhook integration when there's no stdin.  I'll see if I can't find a system to test, but being a user of neither wx, emacs, nor Windows, it might be tricky for me to help.\n"

    "body": "Hi, I've been having this same issue with IPython and WX (...and Emacs and Windows). I've just tried master with my current setup (Windows XP, Python 2.7.2, GNU Emacs 23.1.50.1 (Emacs W32)) and also with the current stable release of Emacs (23.4) and the same thing still happens.\n\nLooking into this a little more, this doesn't seem to be specific to WX on my machine - I get a similar non-functioning guis using Tk as well. That is, the behavior is different when I run Tk commands from IPython within Emacs (either from python-mode or from a shell in Emacs then running IPython) versus running IPython from a command line. Also, Tk integration using the normal python interpreter in Emacs _does_ work, strangely enough.\n\nIs there any chance this has something to do with how IPython handles stdin/stdout? I came across [this note](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/big.html#Sub_002dprocesses) in the Emacs Windows FAQ:\n\n> Programs that explicitly use a handle to the console (CON or CON:) instead of stdin and stdout cannot be used as subprocesses to Emacs, and they will also not work in shell-mode. The default ftp client on Windows is an example of such a program - this ftp program is mostly fine for use with ange-ftp or tramp, but not for M-x ftp (see How do I use FTP within Emacs). There is no convenient way for either Emacs or any shell used in shell-mode to redirect the input and output of such processes from the console to input and output pipes. The only workaround is to use a different implementation of the program that does not use the console directly.\n\nI'll try to narrow things down more, but I'm not a guru with any of these pieces. I can also test things out if anyone has any ideas.\n"

I used EIN, and one thing i dont like is that it is not directly connected with your .py buffer but needs to manually connect a buffer to it before you can do something like \"send line for evaluation\", which is not so natural to me.

    "body": "I recently found another thing that may provide some clue of the problem\nin my ipython shell in emacs, if i do `figure();plot([1,2,3])`\nthe figure window hangs but i still can input new command in ipython shell\nso if i then plot another `figure()`, then the first figure shows up correctly, but the new figure window freezes\n\ni believe that means when i enter command in ipython shell in emacs, the ipython kernel did receive the command, but is still waiting for something like End-Of-Line. when I input another `figure()` command, a default End-Of-Line is sent  to the kernel (or more likely the matplotlib program) to let the previous figure walk through.\nMaybe the difference of EOL character between windows and Unix-like OS causes the issue.\n\nAgain, I wish this info helps to solve the problem, i am not a professional developer, otherwise i would definitely look into this and file a pull request. \nPlease help if some one can figure out a solution based on this, I really appreciate\n"
