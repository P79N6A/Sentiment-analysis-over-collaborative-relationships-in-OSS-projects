How would you extend that to non-executable config files (if we get some one day) ?\n\nFernando and I were thinking about this, and since a JSON-style config file would just be the config dict, we might do something like modifying the key, and storing the data in a dict, such as:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"Class\" : {\n    \"trait\" : \"regular_value\",\n    \"trait2__lazy__\" : {\n      \"extend\" : [ 1, 2, 3 ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n"

It is a really good point that we will have to figure out how to map this onto the pure data of a JSON structure.  I think the `__lazy__` idea is pretty good.  It really emphasizes that this data is not the actual live application data.  The only part where the Python version might be a bit confusing is that some user will eventually using this API to try and read the value of a traitlet in the config file.  Maybe read a list and see if it has an element.  They will discover that the config object does have the live application data though.  \n"
