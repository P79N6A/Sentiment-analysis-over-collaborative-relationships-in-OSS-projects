The aim is to move InteractiveShell away from being a\nsingleton (although it still is for now). So modules should have a hook\nwhich gets called as the InteractiveShell is being set up (e.g. extension\nmodules have a `load_ipython_extension` hook:\nhttp://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/config/extensions.html ).\n"
