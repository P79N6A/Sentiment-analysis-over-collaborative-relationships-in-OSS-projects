    "body": "Saw another example relevant to error handling today. Because prompt_toolkit uses the select.select function, any Python 5.0 prompt on a machine with more than 1024 open file-descriptors will raise a \"ValueError: file descriptor out of range in select()\". The result is that IPython crashes and the prompt blocks - I needed to kill the process.\n\nI'll recommend the select.poll function to the prompt_toolkit team - this would get around that limitation on POSIX environments.\n"
