It could be that `set_text` is called a dozen times before it should be rendered, so rendering on every set_text would be the wrong thing to do.\n\nBut it makes sense to me that perhaps the cell should be un-rendered if set_text is called... though, then again, you could potentially see flicker from code mirror showing up and disappearing if the 3rd party code just did `set_text` followed by render.\n"
