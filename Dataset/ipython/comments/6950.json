    "body": "@jdfreder: @Carreau doesn't like that behaviour, and I partly agree with him, which is why we're toying with various ideas to have some notion of a default kernel as distinct from the last one started.\n\nI still think it might be better to have a separate menu entry 'change default', which brings up a dialog. It's not as visually neat as having both 'start' and 'set default' actions in the same dropdown, but it avoids any confusion from using UI in unfamiliar ways. And I imagine that for most people, changing the default kernel will be a fairly rare action, since it's so easy to use a non-default one.\n"
