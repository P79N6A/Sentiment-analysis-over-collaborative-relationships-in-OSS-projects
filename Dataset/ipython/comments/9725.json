So I'm afraid I won't be of much help here.\n\nOur emacs integration has always been brittle and little maintained, sadly. It's very much in need of a good \"champion\" from the community who uses it regularly and can help us stay on top of things.  It's quite hard to test it automatically in CI (I wouldn't know how to), so it tends to break badly and nobody notices for a while until a release happens.\n\nSorry not to offer a better answer. We might just spin that off into a standalone separate little extension that can be maintained by someone else, since evidently we don't have the cycles or expertise to do a good job on this one.\n"

My solution was also to use ```jupyter console``` but it seems this is also now broken:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nERROR:tornado.application:Exception in callback functools.partial(<function wrap.<locals>.null_wrapper at 0x11411f598>)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/avigan/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/ioloop.py\", line 605, in _run_callback\r\n    ret = callback()\r\n  File \"/Users/avigan/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tornado/stack_context.py\", line 277, in null_wrapper\r\n    return fn(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/Users/avigan/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ipykernel/kernelbase.py\", line 265, in enter_eventloop\r\n    self.eventloop(self)\r\n  File \"/Users/avigan/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ipykernel/eventloops.py\", line 277, in loop_cocoa\r\n    show.mainloop()\r\nAttributeError: 'function' object has no attribute 'mainloop'\r\nJupyter console 5.2.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nSorry I've opened another ticket (#10921) because I have the feeling that there could be a workaround. If I understand correctly, the ```--simple-prompt``` option does not only disable the coloring and complete system but also some things related to events handling. Maybe there could be possibility to disable some of these things separately?\r\n\r\nObviously I don't know much of the inner workings of IPython 5 so it's probably not that simple. Sorry if my proposition seems very naive ;)"
