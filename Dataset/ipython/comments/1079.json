In your case, you can enter any password, and login just redirects you to the front page.  This suggests that login was successful, but it obviously wasn't, as the login button remains (and login is impossible).\n\nI should think that at the very least, trying to login should always fail, and ideally the login button should be disabled in this case as well.\n"

The problem is that we only make a distinction between read-only vs. non-read-only modes, whereas there is a third case: read-only but with the option to log in.  So maybe we can give the read-only property some more states.  I'll have a look at how to best accomplish this.\n"

    "body": "@fperez @minrk This change should make the logic a lot clearer.  There are three states that need to be monitored, each now associated with a method:\n- Was the notebook started with the \"read-only\" flag (method: read_only)\n- Can the user log in, thereby making the notebook rw (method: login_available)\n- Is the current user logged in? (method: logged_in)\n\nI also removed display logic from the javascript, and moved it to the template.  Finally, the password field now receives automatic focus.\n"

If that's an easy fix, go for it, otherwise I'm +1 on merging right now.\n"
