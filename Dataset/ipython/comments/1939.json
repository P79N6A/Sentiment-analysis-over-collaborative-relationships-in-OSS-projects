My vote would be to keep this for 0.14, as even though our api right now has precisely the problems you point out here, I think we can live with the awkwardness for a bit longer so we really nail this.  In my mind, 0.14 will be the rampup to 1.0 status, and the perfect time to plan this.\n\nI'd like to ask @rkern for his thoughts on how this has worked out  for Enthought.  I know you guys have spent a fair bit of time on this question, and gone back and forth a bit.  Thoughts?\n"

    "body": "We never bothered much with categorized APIs, as we were mostly just trying to migrate away from having everything exposed in the `__init__.py` rather than carefully designing things from the ground up. The places where we do that (eg. `chaco.tools.api` separate from `chaco.api`) were already subpackages in their own right. We also have a lot of other modules in our packages, so categorized API modules would be difficult to distinguish from implementation modules. You don't have this problem at the top level, which is good.\n\nI think the categorized API modules directly under `IPython` would work well. Just don't introduce implementation modules at the top level. Then people reading the code can just make a rule in their head that all of the `.py` files at the top level expose public APIs to be used, and the subpackages are just where the implementation is. People who are using IPython imports but not reading the code will just be following the documentation which just won't mention the subpackages in normal examples, so there isn't much room for confusion there, either.\n\nOh, and IPython developers should make a rule in their head to never use those API modules inside the IPython codebase.\n"
