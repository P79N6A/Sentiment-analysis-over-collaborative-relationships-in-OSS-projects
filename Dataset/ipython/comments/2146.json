The problem was only trying to use \"[obj] ??\" (which will print only the docstring) but \"[obj]??\" prints the src-code, as it should be according to the docs, in versions 0.11 through 0.13 ... This leads to the confusion, where people started to think that ?? wasn't working anymore. In the latest version (0.14.dev), they removed this unofficial \"way\" of putting a space between, so that trying to use [obj] ? or [obj] ?? instead of [obj]?? will throw an error now. So everybody should notice, that there shouldn't be a space in between.\n"
