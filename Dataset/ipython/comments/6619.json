    "body": "So I guess the first question is: Where do I get the Python version information from ?\nFrom IPEP17:\n`kernel_info`: an object containing information about the kernel that the notebook should be run with (see also IPEP 13. It should include the following keys:\n-  `name`: the name of the kernel specification\n-  `language`: the language that the kernel runs\n-  `codemirror_mode`: (optional) the codemirror mode to use when displaying the notebook\n\nSo `codemirror_mode` should not be used as you said. `language` is used right now and does not give you version information and `name` will give you `python3` but to use this key seems more like a side effect. Do we need an additional `version` key ?\n"

    "body": "OK, I'm happy to work on this. If you're interested:\n- The `language` key in kernelspecs is intended as a fallback for things like syntax highlighters that don't have an explicit key. We use codemirror for highlighting in the live notebook, and pygments for higlighting in nbconvert, and these have specific keys, but if you wanted to use another tool to highlight it, or maybe do some kind of static analysis, it could use the language key.\n- The language field in metadata is used by some other kernels with IPython 2, before we added kernelspecs. I think IJulia uses it. Once IPython 3 is out, hopefully scripts will appear to turn that into proper kernelspec metadata.\n- `highlight.py`: this code was presumably written before we knew exactly how supporting different languages would work.\n"
