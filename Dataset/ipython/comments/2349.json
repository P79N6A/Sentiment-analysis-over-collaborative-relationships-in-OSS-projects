This\nfunction belongs somewhere obvious and bold (not at the top of\ntextcell.js), because it fundamentally changes the way the regex split\nmethod will behave across the browser tab.  In fact, thinking more\ndefensively about this, we shouldn't modify the base String object's split\nmethod at all, and simply use the replacement function through an external\nAPI.\n\nI'll wait for you to guys to come to a decision about what you want and\nwhere.\n\nA\n\nOn Thu, Sep 6, 2012 at 6:08 AM, Min RK notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Given the untested nature of our js, I would be a bit squeamish putting\n> this in 0.13.1, with only a couple of days of testing.\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/2349#issuecomment-8322719.\n"

    "body": "> Min was -1 on it\n\nI would put it closer to -0.75 :)\n\nThere are really two considerations:\n1. js is untested in general, and since we are only days away from cutting 0.13.1, and this still isn't in master yet, the total 'in the wild' testing is really zero.\n2. To get into certain package environments, 0.13.1 _must_ remain a strict bugfix branch.  While this does fix an annoying issue, it is a much more substantial change to logic than any other in 0.13.1.  I will defer to @juliantaylor on whether this change would be a problem for strict package policies.\n"

    "body": "> The code is pretty complex and it is difficult to tell from just looking at it that it will work. How much of this is taken from StackExchange? I do like the sample notebook that demonstrates the capabilities though.\n\nThe majority of the logic for stripping TeX/LaTeX before sending text to PageDown then replacing it after PageDown has rendered the Markdown-formatted text to HTML-formatted text comes from the StackExchange javascript source.  Unfortunately, the javascript is no longer available from the URL I originally accessed it at, but was linked to from [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11228558/let-pagedown-and-mathjax-work-together).  I improved the source code by incorporating a more robust regular expression parser with explicit licensing.  The StackExchange code is not copyright, but it is also not released in any way.  I was given permission by the moderator team in a StackExchange logged and hosted chat session to reuse the code.\n\nAs pointed out on the discussion list, it would be great if we had a better Markdown parser than Pagedown, but until the competing projects are more mature, I think we are better off piggy-backing larger projects like StackExchange.\n\nAre there any other concerns beside the naming issues?\n"
