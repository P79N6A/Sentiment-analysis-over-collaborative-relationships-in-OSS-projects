    "body": "No, thinking about it now, I don't think it solves any of the the problem.  ipdb would have the history on the kernel, but since the frontend doesn't use the readline history it wouldn't much matter, since you wouldn't actually access it.\n\nAs far as I understand what's going on, ipdb is just hooking getting lines from raw_input.  I don't think the frontend has any knowledge that ipdb is anything but arbitrary Python code asking for input, which probably doesn't make sense in general to hook up to the frontend's history.\n\nIn order for ipdb to have access to a sensible history, we need to do one of the following:\n- add a switch or message, so that the frontend knows whether raw_input requests should engage with the frontend's history\n- treat all raw_input requests as having access to the history (easy, but bad in general)\n- record history of raw_input requests separately, so that you are navigating an entirely independent list of the actual IPython history\n- add first-class support for things like ipdb, so the frontend has full knowledge of the environment, and can try to make the best decisions (ideal, but a fair amount of work).\n\nIn general, running code (scripts, subprocesses, debuggers) that expects anything other than basic text input is just not yet supported in the qtconsole.  A lot of code that 'just works' when running in the same terminal really doesn't when you don't have a terminal (the qtconsole is _not_ a terminal emulator), which is extra frustrating when it looks very similar.\n\nWe definitely need to improve debugger behavior, as they just aren't particularly functional with the qtconsole as it is.\n"

As currently there is an extremely high number of opened issues , it make it really hard to find if a problem is actually known, or going to be worked one. \n\nThe issue of debugger is a more general issue on the Jupyter Project and we are aware of that. \nI'm not sure this issue in particular reflect nicely what the state is, and leaving it open will just incite people to +1, while there likely be no work directly on that. \n\nFeel free to reopen if need, for the time being I'm going to close this. But a fresh issue that lay out nicely all the moving pieces and requirement would be prefered. \n\nThanks.\n"
