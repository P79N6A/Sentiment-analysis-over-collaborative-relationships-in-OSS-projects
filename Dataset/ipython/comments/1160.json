    "body": "@cboos, just wanted to ping you on this one: we merged it after review on IRC and a fair amount of testing.  We realize it may bring back some problem case you might know about and that we couldn't find, so please let us know if that's the case.  But the complete breakage of C-C in master was bad enough that we had to do something to fix it; we're happy to fine-tune further if you know of other edge cases this causes problems with.\n"

    "body": "Thanks for the CC. The changes look good and a0e0692 was indeed a mistake from my part, the correct behavior should indeed be that CTRL+C is allowed outside of the inputhook  (I probably did this silly mistake in an \"afterthought\", wanting to make it symmetric with the ignore_CTRL_C in the catch block, forgetting that the mgr.clear_inputhook() done just a bit later would reenable the CTRL_C). Your `finally` clause makes the intent clearer.\n"
