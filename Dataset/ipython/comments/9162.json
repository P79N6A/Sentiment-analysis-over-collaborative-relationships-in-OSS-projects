    "body": "This is a perfectly normal behavior. \n\nDeprecationWarnings are what they name suggests, warnings about deprecation. Thay are Supposed to be enabled by developers to warn them of deprecated features, what we do by default in IPython. \n\nYou can do it simply with : \n\n```\n$ python2\nPython 2.7.10 (default, Jul 13 2015, 12:05:58)\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.1.0 (clang-602.0.53)] on darwin\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import warnings\n>>> warnings.simplefilter('default')\n```\n\nthen if you continue typing your example:\n\n```\n>>> class MyClass(object):\n...     def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):\n...         return object.__new__(cls, *args, **kwargs)\n...     def __init__(self, a):\n...         self.a = a\n...\n>>> MyClass(1)\n__main__:3: DeprecationWarning: object() takes no parameters\n<__main__.MyClass object at 0x10df0e9d0>\n```\n\nAs stated, `object()` does not takes parameters. Python let you pass parameters without crashing (it emits a warning). Which mean you are strongly advise to not do what stated above as it will fail soon. \n\nAnd indeed in Python 3, object do not take parameter, if you try you will get a `TypeError`. \nThe fix is simple, you just have to not pass parameters to `object` (and switch to Python 3).\n\nI'm going to close the issue, but feel free to continue asking questions. \n"
