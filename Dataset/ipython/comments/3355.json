    "body": "I've got a vague idea for a kind of 'rich diff protocol', because I find there's a lot of filetypes where standard diff isn't much use (e.g. word processor documents - even if you use a text-based format like lyx or flat ODT, the noise makes the diffs all but unusable). This is kind of a long-term thing: it might be interesting to build the prototype framework with a notebook diff tool, but you're equally welcome to just solve the problem at hand directly if you prefer.\n\nThis has actually been going around in my head this morning, so here's a few notes on what I envisage:\n- The diffs only need to be for viewing: if you need to actually send a change to be applied, use a standard diff or binary diff format.\n- Format adapters only need to handle extracting features from one file: the master program will compare those features.\n- The master calls the format adapter with a list of mimetypes it can diff and display, like the HTTP accept header. So you might have a command-line diff tool that can only display text, and a web frontend that can display rich text and images.\n- The format adapter returns a series of chunks with data in those mimetypes. The master program aligns them and displays a rich diff.\n- If a block of data can't be represented in any of the requested mimetypes, the format adapter emits it as a hash and a mimetype, so the frontend can optionally show something like [Image data changed].\n- It possibly needs some features to deal with unordered container files (e.g. zip files are an unordered collection of files, sqlite files are an unordered collection of tables). I haven't thought much about this yet.\n\nThis also draws a bit from [lesspipe](http://www-zeuthen.desy.de/~friebel/unix/lesspipe.html), which I just learned about this morning.\n"

    "body": "@Carreau Ah, yes — sorry, I should have gone into more detail here.\n\nFor a first pass, I'd like to build a tool that would would just diff entire notebooks, not cell contents. Imagine a 3-way-merge where, instead of lines of code, you have complete notebook cells.\n\nThis way you can sidestep a lot of the Very Hard problems, and get something that will be immediately (well, with only a few hours of work) somewhat useful.\n\nAgain at first pass: I imagine building it as a standalone tool which can be called in place of `merge (1)`… Something like: `nbmerge a.ipynb b.ipynb base.ipynb`. It would pull up a browser which would look more or less like a standard 3-way merge, and when the merge is complete, it would save the merged notebook.\n\nOf course, from there, it would be straight forward to diff only two notebooks.\n"

    "body": "Glad to see you're taking a shot at this!  Needless to say, this should be done as a purely standalone experiment for now, so you have the freedom to control development without worrying too much about integration with the core.\n\nWhile I agree with @takluyver that this problem fits into the larger context of complex format diffing, I also think that you should start by focusing on one specific thing, namely IPython notebooks, for a first prototype.  It can be generalized later once you have something that works, but this is exactly the kind of problem where trying to build from the outset a completely generic tool is likely to lead to an abstraction monstrosity that's both unmanageable and sub-optimal in any specific case.\n\nThere's a _ton_ of room for interesting experimentation here on what will be good output.  I personally really like [LaTeXdiff](http://emeryblogger.com/2011/01/14/diff-your-latex-files-with-latexdiff), as a tool for diffing latex-sourced files in a rich context.  I'd encourage you to have a look at it for inspiration.\n"
