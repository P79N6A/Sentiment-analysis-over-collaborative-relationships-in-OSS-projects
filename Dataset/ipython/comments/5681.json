    "body": "I think the problem here, is that MathJax has some support for plainTeX (or AMSTeX) Macros like `\\cases` which are not supported by LaTeX. Hence, this \"bug\" should be corrected in the original ![source](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/tree/master/Chapter2_MorePyMC) and is not related to IPython. You may create an issue there.\n"
