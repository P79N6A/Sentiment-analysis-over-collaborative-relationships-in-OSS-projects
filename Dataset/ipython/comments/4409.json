This is the pattern we see in Pandoc's yaml headers, also now used in RStudio's Rmd files, Jekyll etc.  While in each of those such metadata can be hard-coded in templates like it sounds is the ipynb way, in those contexts hard-wiring the template is frowned upon and this metadata is much more easily set external to the template.\n\nFor an example use case: I have my students submit hw in pdf form exported from ipynb, which is beautiful and works entirely from the notebook interface.  It would be great if they could add their name to the author field, but I don't expect them to manage command line options and custom templates to do so.
