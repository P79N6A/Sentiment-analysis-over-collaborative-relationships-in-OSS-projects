What I have done now is the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif sys.executable.endswith('pythonw.exe'):\r\n    sys.stdout = open(self.logFilePath + '/stdout.txt', 'w')\r\n    sys.stderr = open(self.logFilePath + '/stderr.txt', 'w')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyway, do you actually discourage the use of `InProcessKernel`? Can you suggest an alternative?\r\n\r\nI am looking for a way to include a scripting tool into my application. I require access to some functionality of the app obviously. I don't exactly need all the bells and whistles of IPython, but it struck me as an easy and straightforward way.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the help,, much appreciated."

It's kind of de facto deprecated already.\r\n\r\n> Can you suggest an alternative?\r\n\r\nYou can embed the kernel in your application and run the Qt console to talk to it as a separate window:\r\nhttps://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/blob/master/examples/embedding/ipkernel_qtapp.py\r\n\r\nIt should also be possible to have the Qt console embedded in the application and talking over a ZMQ channel to the same process (i.e. not using InProcessKernel), but I don't think we have an example for this yet."

    "body": "Is the discussion about deprecating the InProcessKernel going on in another forum, and if so, is it possible to provide a link? The last I read on this subject, the InProcessKernel was the only way of ensuring that the console had access to other objects in the GUI, within which it is embedded (see p. 297 [here](https://media.readthedocs.org/pdf/ipython-docs/latest/ipython-docs.pdf), for example). If that is still the case, its functionality is vital to applications like [NeXpy](http://nexpy.github.io/nexpy/), where the Qt QTreeView is synchronized with the kernel shell. So I would like to contribute to the discussion and argue for its continuation unless or until there is a replacement."

We're not maintaining it, it's a headache when people inevitably run into bugs with it, and if we ever get round to the reworking of `jupyter_client` I keep trying to do, it's bound to break. A better alternative would be a way to launch a kernel in-process, but have it communicate using ZMQ sockets like any other kernel, so it doesn't require a different communications layer."
