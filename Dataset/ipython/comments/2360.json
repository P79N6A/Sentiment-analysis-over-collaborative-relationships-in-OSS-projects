Two choices (Replace/Cancel), where Cancel results in no action, and Replace overwrites the existing notebook (this is most common).\n2. Append counter without prompting for name collisions (see Downloads behavior of any browser).\n3. Three choices (Replace/Cancel/Keep Both), where Keep Both behaves the same as 2 (see Finder copy in recent OS X).\n\nThe important thing here: In none of these cases are _existing_ notebooks renamed.  It is always the new notebook that either gets a new name or replaces the existing notebook.\n"

    "body": "I think the difference is to never change the name of an already existing file on disk.\nIf the new file has a name conflict you propose to rename or append something to the \"new file\".\nwe might want to consider usecase where the user can't choose, and the api respond with the name of the save file: \n- you upload \"Untilted.ipynb\"\n- saved as \"Untilted_X.ipynb\"\n\nIf one want backup when overwriting the functionality should not be added here.\nIt should be the role of the underlying backend. \nWe then should come up with the right abstraction for that, wether the backend is a DB, a git backend...\nwith the possibility to pass custom information between backend/frondend.\n\nIf the abstraction is well chosen enough, it should be trivial for user to add auto backup on their own or with a quick googling. Maybe a pre/post-save hook in js/pyhton. Haven't thought of how.\n\nThe same subject has already been discussed before with \"swap\" file ending in \"~\" on the mailing list, and we agreed that it would be a bad choice to have auto-generated \"garbage\" file.\n\nThis of course does not mean that we don't want the functionality, but that it is not ment to be in the core, and we'll be happy to have a oneliner that do it. It would have its place in the cookbook of the wiki.\n"
