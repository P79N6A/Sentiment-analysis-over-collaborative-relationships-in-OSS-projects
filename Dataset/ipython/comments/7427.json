I have worked around it trivially by adding /usr/bin to the path so that `which` exists. I am fine with this being marked wont-fix or just closed, it's a fairly weird maybe-bug that very few people will experience. I just figured that since I ran into it and was surprised I should probably report it and let you decide what you want to do with it :)\n"
