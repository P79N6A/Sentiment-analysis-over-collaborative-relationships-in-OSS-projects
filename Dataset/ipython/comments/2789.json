    "body": "@Carreau OK you are probably going to wake up in a few hours.  I have a few more before I crash.  When I was working on this branch, I broke the hiding/showing of the cell toolbars.  The reason is that i had to create a ctb_wrapper div that has an hbox class.  Because of this I can't just add and remove the `display: block` as you were doing before.\n\nBut more importantly, I realized that the current design couples the management of all of the CellToolbars into the class itself.  The problem is that it means people can't easily create cells by hand and show/hide the celltoolbar on a per cell basis.  We don't need to do that, but I can easily imagine people who might want to do this.  Let's maybe try to IRC about this tomorrow.\n"

Will try to look at ot later.\n"

    "body": "@Carreau OK I am done with this work.  Please look carefully at what I did.  There is still one problem: all celltoolbar instances have to have the same preset active.  But let's merge this and worry about that later if people need it.\n\nOne thing we need to be very careful about is decoupling our classes.  For example, you had the creation of the select UI for the main toolbar as a class attributed of CellToolbar.  That made it difficult to change the UI for preset selection when cells are used on other web pages.  Have a look at how I decoupled these things - I used events and a new list_presets method.\n\nBut this branch should be ready to merge after you double check everything.\n"

    "body": "The ctb_prompt was needed because of how the prompt area is sized.  It has a width in ex units, but a padding in em.  The padding in em is needed to match what CodeMirror uses and the ex units are the right units to use to get the prompt area to shrink/grow as the font size changes.  The other complication is that browsers change the pixel meaning of ex and em based on the font size.  This is what was causing the misalignment when changing the font size on Linux.  The only clean way of fixing this is to put the ctb_prompt div there and have it sized in exactly the same way as the real prompt area.\n"
