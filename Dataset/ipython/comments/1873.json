We always thought we'd get to implementing such capabilities with a nicer UI in the 'real' ipython, but for whatever reason that has just not happened (well, the reason being we're totally swamped in a million other things, obviously). \n\nBut that had always been part of the plan, so now may be a good time to start thinking about how to do it right.  Thanks for bringing it back up.\n"
