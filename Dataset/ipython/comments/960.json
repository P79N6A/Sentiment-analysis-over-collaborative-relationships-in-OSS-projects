    "body": "Has been fixed in master (by 1a64b37c5f6224b927c4b51db951c1874c7f0a82).  This issue has duplicate reports #704, #720, #817, #843, #858 and #935, all of which are 'SyntaxError crashes IPython' when using a keyword such as 'continue', 'return', 'break', etc. in the wrong scope.  I think we might get a separate report for every keyword in Python by the time we cut 0.12 with the fix.\n"
