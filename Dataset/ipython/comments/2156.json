    "body": "Furthermore, it seems to me that there isn't really anything _we_ should/could be changing here.  As you guys said above, given that each distro is free to split as it wishes and also names things differently, I'd rather the distros do what Debian did than us give a generic but invalid message, and one that would imply that there _is_ a package manager that has the right dependencies to begin with.\n\nPeople can be on such an old distro that their package manager doesn't _have_ a valid dep, and they must therefore do everything from source (assuming no root access).\n\nMy vote is to close this as not being something really for us to fix.\n"
