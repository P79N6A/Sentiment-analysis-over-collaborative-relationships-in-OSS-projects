    "body": "@rgbkrk: Yeah, I tried this with mitmproxy and it worked perfectly fine. Kinda scary. Just imagine a SciPy conference/event where everyone is on a shared WiFi/sitting in the same subnet. You could probably compromise _lots_ of machines just by ARP spoofing the network.\n\nI like the idea of a one-time password/access token appended to the URI which automatically authenticates the user. This would prevent the aforementioned software in a sandbox from wreaking havoc, and reduce the attack surface (CSRF, XSS...).\n"
