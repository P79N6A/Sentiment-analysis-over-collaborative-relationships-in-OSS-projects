Removing matplotlib also removes the error\nand indeed importing pyplot changes the value so sympy is not responsible in any way\nit is just a result of sympy starting to use matplotlib to do plots.  Note that just importing matplotlib does nothing\nso thats the reason that check matplotlib does not trigger the error. \n\nI'm running the latest version of matplotlib of the 1.1.1 branch and the same happens with \n1.1.0. Clearing the .matlplotlib dir has no effect. \n"
