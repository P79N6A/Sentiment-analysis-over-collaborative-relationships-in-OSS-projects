    "body": "To save other people a moment, we have `inputhook_wx{1,2,3}`, and their docstrings say:\n1. Run the wx event loop by processing pending events only.\n   \n   This approach seems to work, but its performance is not great as it\n   relies on having PyOS_InputHook called regularly.\n2. Run the wx event loop, polling for stdin.\n   \n   This version runs the wx eventloop for an undetermined amount of time,\n   during which it periodically checks to see if anything is ready on\n   stdin.  If anything is ready on stdin, the event loop exits.\n3. Run the wx event loop by processing pending events only.\n   \n   This is like inputhook_wx1, but it keeps processing pending events\n   until stdin is ready.  After processing all pending events, a call to\n   time.sleep is inserted.  This is needed, otherwise, CPU usage is at 100%.\n   This sleep time should be tuned though for best performance.\n\nAt present, we use `inputhook_wx3` on all platforms.\n"
