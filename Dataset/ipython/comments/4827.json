    "body": "This changes the info dict so the 'source' field can be a list of 2-tuples. I think the info dict also gets sent to frontends on an object_info_request, so changes to its structure might break frontends. We're also trying to take it in the direction of being more language agnostic, which might need some more thought. Do you want to join our next online dev meeting (Thursday, 10am PST) to discuss this more?\n"

    "body": "I've checked that hack with \"regular\" frontends and it seemed to work, but I agree that interface concerns are perfectly reasonable.\n\nIn that case it may be structurally cleaner to embrace the fact that there can be multiple \"kinds\" of sources for objects and add those additional \"kinds\" of sources as separate fields into \"info\" dictionary, e.g. descriptor protocol sources (properties being a special case of that), places where constants of built-in types are set and so on.  I thought that these things should be figured out by now in libraries like `rope` or `jedi` (at least to some extent), so relying on code introspection libraries to do actual _code introspection_ may be a win-win. I'll think in that direction.\n"

IPython don't have users, only dev :-). After you have the \"core dev\" who have commit right, but this is just when you start contributing regularly and we just can't keep up with the review, so we give you commit right :-)\n\nAs far as the Meeting they are live (and archived) on youtube, so yo can look at them whenever you want.\nJust tell us you like to hangout live, and we'll send you an invitation by mail when the hangout start. \nWe filter people on live hangout because google have difficulties handeling more than 10. \n"

Maybe the logic that drops docstrings if the source is shown should do some duplication detection to handle that.\n"
