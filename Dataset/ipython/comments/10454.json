    "body": "That's unrelated to IPython, the issue comes from installing [scandir](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scandir), you should see that with the scandir maintainers. \r\n\r\nIf you are missing Python.h during compilation that's likely because you are missing the Python header. If you are going to compile c-extensions (which you do implicitly by install in scandir) you may want to install the Python headers (`apt-get install python-dev` maybe ?)."

Sorry for my verbosity.\r\nSo, `whereis Python.h` and `whereis 'Python.h'` turn up nothing at all.\r\n\r\nThis is a remote machine that was set up only with Python 2.7 on it when I first got access.\r\nI didn't even have gcc so I ran `sudo yum groupinstall 'development tool' ` _afterwards._\r\nCould this be the problem? If so, should I uninstall Python and reinstall it?\r\n\r\nIf the above doesn't matter:\r\nI'm a sudo user but not root, so I can `scp` any files I want to most places.\r\nI just don't have any idea what to copy (some C header file Python.h?), where to copy it, and what to do (add something to gcc's include path right?, but from where is that gcc command being run? I don't know.\r\n\r\nI'm stuck using `yum` (yuck) and `rpm` so unfortunately `apt-get` can't solve my problems.\r\nAccording to the docs, I must use **ipython** version 5 and **scandir** version < 1.6 with **Python 2.7**.  I cannot use Python 3.x because of 3rd party API constraints.\r\n\r\nI'm an experienced developer (on everything except RHEL) so manual installation doesn't scare me.... I just can't find anything about how to do it. \r\n\r\nAs for my PATH, it's currently quite short as this machine has just been set up.\r\n(It had Python 2.7 installed as I requested but nothing else, not even gcc. )\r\n\r\n```\r\n~$ echo $PATH\r\n/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin\r\n```\r\nPython lives here:\r\n```\r\n$ whereis python\r\npython: /usr/bin/python /usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/lib/python2.7 /usr/lib64/python2.7 /etc/python /usr/include/python2.7 /usr/share/man/man1/python.1.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Complete reporting is a virtue in these kinds of situations.\r\n```\r\nsudo yum install python-devel\r\npip install scandir==1.5\r\n```\r\nThat should install the Python header files to \"/usr/include/python2.7/\" and get the appropriate scandir version you need. If you have further errors, don't hesitate to post again!\r\n\r\nAlso, small correction from before. I should have advised you to use the following to check for the presence of the headers:\r\n```\r\nsudo updatedb\r\nlocate Python.h\r\n```\r\nAt the time, I didn't realize that `whereis` is restricted to executables, their man pages, and their source files."

    "body": "Again, if all else fails, we can dispense with yum and just pull the includes straight from the Python source ([https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.14/Python-2.7.14.tgz](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.14/Python-2.7.14.tgz)). After you unzip, you'll find Python.h in the \"Include\" directory of the unzipped file. Standard practice seems to be to plug the includes into `/usr/include/python2.7/`. So, once you have them in place, you can try `pip install scandir==1.5` again. If gcc still can't find the includes, then we'll either need to add `/usr/include/python2.7/` to the system path or download the scandir source and modify the call to gcc in the setup files for scandir."

    "body": "It's really strange for yum to have `python34-devel.x86_64` and not the equivalent for Python 2.7.\r\n\r\nTo fix your immediate problem, you can download and install the Python 2.7 development package directly from the CentOS repo at http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/Packages/python-devel-2.7.5-58.el7.x86_64.rpm. Then you can `scp` it over and install it as follows:\r\n```\r\nsudo rpm -ivh python-devel-2.7.5-58.el7.x86_64.rpm\r\n```\r\nIn the long run, you'll probably want to add the CentOS repositories to yum so you can get the other yum packages you're interested in.

    "body": "Lastly, I see what you mean about the stripped-down nature of RHEL. I've been playing around with the minimal installation, and it's remarkable how little it includes. No `wget`, `mlocate`, `python-devel`, or `ruby`. However, _all_ of those packages are available on the original installation media in the Packages directory. If IT can help you, I'd _highly_ recommend having them copy the entire Packages directory from the installation media to your machine so that you have an easy, reliable place to source your packages even when yum is failing. Alternatively,  you can download the CentOS version of most if not all of these packages directly from http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/Packages and install them using the `rpm` command. Admittedly, `yum` is superior if you can get it to work since it handles dependencies for you; but, for that, you'd have to add the CentOS repos using the guide I cited above."
