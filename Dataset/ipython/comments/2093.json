So if you want to try again, please do so, and don't hesitate to ask for advice. \n\nYou can have a look at [github for windows](http://windows.github.com/) if you dislike the comandline ,  github also just released [try github in your browser](https://github.com/blog/1183-try-git-in-your-browser).\n\n> Please forget this stupid script\n\nThere no stupid script, and we are really low on people using IPython on windows. so any fixes are welcome. \nSo if you just don't want / don't have time to learn how to do things, just say so and someone else will make a PR.\n"
