    "body": "Yes, it will fall foul of the case @jasongrout mentions. There are _two_ differences between physical and logical line transformations:\n- Logical lines are assembled with explicit `\\` line continuations.\n- Logical line transformers are not applied when we're within a Python string, so that e.g. this will work:\n\n```\n>>> a = \"\"\"\n... %foo\n... \"\"\"\n```\n\n(The prompts are removed by physical line transformers, but magic transformation is done by a logical line transformer, so it doesn't see %foo. a is set to `'\\n%foo\\n'`)\n\nI put cell magics in logical transformations, because I think explicit line continuations are common to many languages. If we move them to physical transformations, we'll need to tweak the transformer so it only acts if the `%%foo` is the first line of a cell.\n\nI might also put it after the prompt cleaners, so we can do something like this:\n\n```\nIn [1]: %%timeit setup_foo()\n   ...: [a**2 for a in foo]\n   ...: \n```\n"
