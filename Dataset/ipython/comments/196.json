(sys.getdefaultencoding()) And also what is the encoding in your Terminal window?\n\nThe normal default with 2.x is ascii, in which case you actually can't do:\nu'é' in a Terminal, as far as I know (I get a UnicodeError just typing that)\n\nNote that if you have sys.setdefaultencoding='utf8', then you can type that, but weird things can happen, as I recently learned from Robert Kern.\n\nWith utf8 as default encoding, I was able to perform the example you mention:\n\nIn [21]: f = open(u\"Expérimentations/test.dat\")\n\nIn [22]: print f.read()\nasdf\n\nThe bug could be that I think 'Exp\\xc3\\xa9rimentations' should actually be 'Exp\\xa9rimentations'.\n\nUnicode seriously confuses me, so good luck to Fernando working on this.\n"
