The other problem is that v3 notebooks are supposed to have `metadata` properties for all worksheets and all cells. There are two possible solutions:\n- have the convert code add `metadata`\n- make `metadata` be optional in the JSON schema\n\nI think it would probably be better to make it optional in the JSON schema, since my guess is that there are notebooks floating around out there that have been saved as v3 and do not include metadata (and then we should just make sure that when we do v4 we enforce that it's required). \n"
