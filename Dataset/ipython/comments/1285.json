    "body": "After re-reading the discussion more carefully and looking at the code, I'd like to ask if this is really necessary, given that `v1*v2` provides a valid solution in most cases... \n\nThis feature does add some complexity to the search mechanism, so we should be sure that it's really worth the cost.  Alternatively, the problem might be better addressed with a simple _documentation_ update, adding mention of this possibility to the `%hist` docstring along with perhaps a short example.  Thoughts?\n"
