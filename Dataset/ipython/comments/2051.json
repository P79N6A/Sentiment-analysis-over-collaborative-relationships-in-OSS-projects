    "body": "Okay, here's a third idea, since having the metadata in the header just seems awkward.  For one, the header lives on as parent_headers for possibly a long time.  Secondly, an application (like callbacks in javascript) could care about metadata, but would probably rarely care about message ids or session uuids, so there seems to be a logical distinction between metadata/subheader and the header.  In a sense, the header deals with routing, while metadata deals with the content.\n\nInstead, how about adding a (optional?) `metadata` attribute to the basic message spec, so messages would look like `{header: {...}, parent_header: {...}, metadata: {...}, content: {...}}`?  Things like the javascript callbacks would get the message content and the metadata.\n"

    "body": "Further thinking out loud:\n\nThere are three options:\n1. metadata in the header (possibly via subheader).  I don't like this, because I don't think most library code should be using headers for anything.  The content should be everything you need to know about the message itself, and the headers should only be used for low-level routing of handlers.  But this is exactly what I did in the parallel code for message introspection without unpacking content.\n2. metadata as a fourth top-level component of all messages.  On some level, this is the cleanest, but most handlers really only need the 'content' of the message after the Application has used the headers to figure out what handlers to call.  So this would mean we are always passing the whole Message around, or we are always passing two dicts (content and metadata) around.\n3. metadata as an optional key in all content dicts.  This has the benefit of extending what we already have, rather than changing it.  But we don't actually use the metadata key from displaypub for anything, so there's not a high cost to change.\n\nPersonally, I'm thinking 2. is the best choice right now, as @jasongrout proposed.\n"
