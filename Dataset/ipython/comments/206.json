    "body": "IPython did not find the readline module, which is not on OSX by default, as indicated by 'Leopard libedit detected'.\n\n```\neasy_install readline\n```\n\nshould solve it.\n\nI suppose this is as good a place as any to say this:\n\nreadline should be a hard dependency on PyPI for IPython on OSX, because the libedit errors are weird and confusing for many people, and interactive terminal IPython is basically unusable without readline.\n\nAt the very least, the 'libedit detected' message should have more information and suggest `easy_install readline`.\n"
