    "body": "That might be a bit harder than it sounds.  The pylab_activate function does print the message (exactly as it should, for example when invoked by the %pylab magic).  The problem is, the Widget doesn't know what the pylab backend will be until the kernel has started, and printed the message, by which time the widget banner has long-since been drawn, so changing it will have no effect.\n\nOf course, an easier option would be to allow you to disable printing the 'welcome to pylab' message outright, so that you could prevent it from appearing, just like you can do with the banner.\n"

    "body": "Yes, unfortunately it simply can't be added to the banner, because `pylab_activate` can be called at _any time_, way after the kernel is already running and the banner is long gone.  In that regard, I think we should simply close this issue, because there is simply no way to do what the title requests.  At most, we can add a 'quiet' flag to `pylab_activate`, so that users who are customizing things can call it themselves with `quiet=True` so it doesn't print anything and instead.  @punchagan, would that work for you?\n"

Print messages that result from startup are clearly distinguishable (no parent) at the frontend.  The advantage here is that it is most likely for frontend embedders to want to flip this switch, and it's slightly harder to propagate config to the kernel than it is to set a flag in the frontend.\n"
