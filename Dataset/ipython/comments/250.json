Should be get away from it?\n  What do your recommend?  I like that recv returns a raw dict. I think\n  session should deal primarily with dicts at its core.\n\n# displayhook.py\n- Where was the parent being set before near L17?  Was this a bug?\n\nOther than that, this looks good.  Why don't you fix these things and go \nahead and merge.\n"
