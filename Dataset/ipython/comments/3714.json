    "body": "That would make %%rest would be a purely kernel-side magic (unlike any other rich-output display magic).  This might be okay, though there are serious issues with rendering rST one cell at a time (gist: it doesn't make sense).  restructured text has lots of implicit document-wide formatting that can only be computed a whole document at a time.\n\nFor instance, let's say you have these two cells:\n\n``` rst\nh1\n==\n\nsome text\n```\n\n``` rst\nh2\n--\n\nmore text\n```\n\nWhat would you expect the formatting of the text 'h2' to have? If you answered \"exactly the same as h1\", you would be right.  But if you concatenate the two cells into one, it would change and \"h2\" would be a lower level than h1.  It is this sort of thing that made us reject reST as a good fit for the notebook - rst just makes no sense without rendering an entire document (or multi-document environment) at a time.\n"
