(Did you test that?)\r\n\r\nIf so, I think a solution would be to use the asyncio even loop with a custom \"selector\". The selector is the blocking call that waits for any kind of IO. Within the selector you can run another event loop, and glue them together.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I think I like the direction where this is going!"

As we just released 7.0 I doubt I want to merge this in the 7.x branch."
