    "body": "> So far, 3 days after release - main Installing IPython section of http://ipython.org/install.html is useless place to look for 1.0 - Anaconda / EPD (CanopyExpress) still got 0.13.x (ubuntu 0.12x)\n\nThis is the reason of the following message : \n\n```\n...it will take a few days to appear in Anaconda, EPD and Linux distributions.\n```\n\nWe can't do much more.\n\n> Anaconda & Canopy Express might sound quite exotic (compared to all the rest installation options hidden in Docs) for an average Python. Both options weight over 200Mb without prior explanation why\n\n```\nFor new users who want to get up and running with minimal effort,...\n```\n\nSeem like a good explanation to me. Download, run, it works.\nWe had more explanation, and had complaint of the install doc beeing too long and too complicated. \nUser just want it to work.\n\n> There is no clear way to choose Python version beforehand. If user has Python3, he/she gets 2.7 from Anaconda by default.\n\nAnd this is stated in the docs : \n\n```\n... which provide a setup based on Python 2.7\n```\n\nSame as before, asking user to choose 2.x / 3.x is for most already too much and will force us to enter into detail targeted people have no interest in (for this page). \n\n> Despite first line about \"more detailed steps in Documentation\" - there are absolutely nothing (no details) on Anaconda - apt-get in Documentation, which has alternative set of installation methods instead.\n\nFull sentence end with \n\n```\ndetailed instructions for manual **installs** from **source**, targeted at **advanced** users and **developers**.\n```\n\nStill, PR welcomed that could add link to subpages and explanation.\n\nOne could also write heuristics that detect the browser/os/... and provide for custom instruction like [heroku toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) but this is a full time job and lots of maintenance, so it will probably not be done by people in the core (at least not before we have take over a big part of the world).\n"

    "body": "Just to summarise what Matthias has said at length: there are a bunch of ways to install IPython, and almost all of them suck for one reason or another. The best method depends on your operating system, your level of expertise, what you've already got installed, and what you want to do with it. The installation page has to highlight the easiest options, and resist the temptation to confuse users with alternatives. We know that's not ideal, but it's not a problem we can easily solve.\n"

    "body": "Hi @2tolik ,\n\nI agree IPython could be much easier to install.  I hope that one day we do have a one click installer; however, for now we do not have the resources to do so.\n\n> We know that's not ideal, but it's not a problem we can easily solve.\n\n:+1: \n\nFor what it's worth, when I install IPython on a new machine I _sort of_ follow this procedure:\n1. Install Python\n2. (optionally) If I remember the dependencies (there are only a handful), I install them first.\n3. Download IPython version (I use git a pull master directly from this repository)\n4. `Python setup.py build` & `Python setup.py install`\n5. Install missing dependencies\n6. Repeat 4 and 5 until no missing dependencies\n"

Being relativly new to some systems and tools, still I can manage IPython installation in all possible ways (and verify them along the way :) \n\nI wrote this ticket becase I'm worried that an average person interested in IPython will have difficulties installing IPython 1.0 he/she just heard in news or been wainting for sometime. And just because of old static page, which is \"technically correct\" he/she might got to come through some negative WTFs or simply might be unalbe to get to fascinating IPython world and see what its developers made possible after months of hard work. \n\nSimple as that. I believe there should be straight and obvious ways to get expected results. Agile way - make it working first (up-to-date links and consistent info), and arrange all the details later. \n"

    "body": "We agree with you that it's not a great experience for newcomers. But fundamentally, that's not because of our docs, it's because there aren't any good installation options that work well in all cases. `setup.py` won't get you dependencies. `pip` didn't handle binary installers until the very latest version, and it's a faff if people don't already have it installed. Plus if you're installing IPython, there's a good chance you want modules like numpy and matplotlib as well. Anaconda and EPD address all of those issues, and they even work for people who don't already have Python set up.\n\nContinuum and Enthought are probably already aware that there's a new release of IPython - the community communicates effectively. There is a PPA, but Julian, who runs it, is otherwise occupied for a few more days.\n\nFor the sundry changes, like EPD -> Canopy, feel free to open a pull request. You can find the source file here: https://github.com/ipython/ipython-website/blob/master/install.rst\n"
