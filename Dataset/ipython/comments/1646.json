    "body": "Yes, it would absolutely be useful, I just haven't gotten around to it yet (and it may be quite some time before I do).  The trickier part of adding Manager support to Engines (as opposed to interactive Kernels) is its requirements:\n- For MPI, the Engine itself _must_ be the first process started by `ipengine`, so the KernelManager would have to be a child of the process it controls.\n- The Control queue should go through the Manager, but other messages should go direct to the Kernel.\n\nAdding such a manager would give the following abilities:\n- interrupt\n- restart\n- forceful shutdown (right now, a blocking engine cannot be shutdown cleanly until the current task finishes)\n\nThis change should be done in such a way as to enable remote signaling of kernels in the two-process model (not currently possible).\n"
