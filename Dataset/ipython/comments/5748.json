    "body": "Before forgetting, `.vbox` is not removed, it is now part of `.cell` to allow to overwrite with css, \nand I am one that pushed to have that.\n\n---\n\nI suppose such a pull request would be accepted, though we probably need someone to update the state of such a document. It is though not a secret that the css and html classes will be cleaned up and refactor, and even if we do our best not to break the css, I do not think we committed to keep backward compatibility.\n\nthe rest is my personal opinion and might not reflect the feeling of the all team.\n\n---\n\nIn my humble opinion a document describing the change would only be worth it once the css/html structure are stabilized.\n\nOf course people do nice things and prefer to [rewrite by hand the css template we provide](https://github.com/nsonnad/base16-ipython-notebook) whereas we do our best to provide a way to recompile our css by [just changing already existing variable](https://gist.github.com/Carreau/11095832). \n\nI expressed many times [citation needed] the fact that nbviewer should support theme as part of notebook metadata (I even had a prototype), and that I had concern that changing html could break notebook that [inject their own css](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/wrobstory/bearcart/blob/master/examples/bearcart_examples.ipynb). But people still prefer the old approach than helping to patch the current codebase to bring new feature.\n\nI also feel that a document describing the changes would be counterproductive conveying the feeling that : \n1. We commit not to break user theme.\n2. We are confortable enough with css and html theming.\n3. It push people away from contributing to core.\n\nI would much rather have a document that state something along : \n\n> We do our best to keep theming of the notebook possible, though, because of the lack of manpower we reserve the right to break the html and css structure of the generated notebook at any time. If you are interested in having a more stable structure we welcome contribution on the main IPython repository, once we feel that the structure is stable enough and have people to maintain a feature, we can commit not to break it and provide documented changes.\n\nSuch contribution would include but are not be limited to: \n- decouple css from js\n- get css class name that do not conflict when embedding.\n- document how we build our css (yes we have a special css for embedding)\n- write how nbconvert works.\n\neg, I (try to) maintain a build of the [js doc](http://ipjsdoc.herokuapp.com/), can give access to the app on demand.\n\nLastly, I believe that such a thing would be nice on IPython wiki were it is editable by everyone.\n\nHope that make sens and that this message does not feel too angry, it is more supposed to convey a sens of despair.\n\n(also relevant, things like #5556)\n"

Much better to spend time focusing on improving the actual code.\n- I also agree with @Carreau that we should move towards CSS themes for the notebook, but again, only after the HTML/CSS becomes stable.\n\n@Carreau sorry you feel despair - maybe too much time working on your thesis ;-)\n"

Your response makes a great deal of sense, and I think that I can try writing up a page of documentation that will offer designers the insights that you are sharing, so that they know where the project is at design-wise and how best to be along for the ride with their own IPython Notebook powered efforts. Look for a pull request from me this weekend.\n"
