I see two possible ways to distinguish these:\n1. add a `create` key (True for upload, False for save), which does the increment-until-no-clobber behavior of an Untitled notebook.\n2. add an `overwrite` key (True for save, False for upload), which just fails with 409 if exists and overwrite is False (this matches the rename behavior, which refuses to clobber notebooks).\n"

Currently, if the user does overwrite an existing notebook, both notebooks are shown in the list after uploading.\n- There is a funny bug that shows up sometimes - sometimes, after you attempt an upload, you can't do another upload. I don't know what specifically causes this, but once you are in this broken state upload never works at all.\n- The current design still allows a user to overwrite a notebook on upload. IOW, it is just a warning. The problem is that a user could still make a mistake and overwrite a notebook. This could happen especially because the new name they choose in an attempt to avoid overwriting could also be taken. I would prefer that the fix simply doesn't allow the user to overwrite a notebook at all.\n- I think we can improve the error message, but first let's finalize the overall approach.\n"
