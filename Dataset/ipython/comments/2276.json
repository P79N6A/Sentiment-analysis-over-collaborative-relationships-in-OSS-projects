    "body": "@shabble `Oddly, the same error occurs even when using a single threaded runserver` Regarding the reason of why this happens: I believe this is because Django actually executes two instances in order to be able to reload: one for running the server, the other for checking the files. When you execute with `--noreload`, a single instance will run, and no error will be observed on SIGINT.\n"
