I don't think it's that big of deal if the first few rows are not visible when the dropdown menu blocks them because the dropdown menu visually is a floating element (shadow suggests that).\n- I feel a little uneasy about the \"stickyness\" of the menu - the dropdown not hiding when you select an item.\n- I think the count is a good idea.  If we decide not for all the items, I think we should at least show it for the running notebooks.\n"

It does address #7628).\n\nRemoved changes:\n- sticky menu.\n- checkboxes and counters in menu.\n\nBehavior:\n![simple-tree-selector](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7703352/6143588/cb925b42-b1cb-11e4-80f4-c2a02fc38202.gif)\n"

The second suggestion changes a bit the behavior : selecting \"all notebooks\" for exemple will now also deselect everything else (before, it was just adding all notebooks to the selection, but not changing the rest).
