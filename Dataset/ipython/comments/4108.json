    "body": "Can you be more specific on the problem you have? For me (1.0.0) everything works as expected. \nRaw cells content is put into the .tex files **as they are** (without any treatment), hence if you want to write something like `foo_bar` in the \"normal\" text you have to escape the underscore yourself `foo\\_bar`. (Exactly as you would do in LaTeX as underscores are only allowed in math environments without backslash). If you want the underscore in math mode, it should work without any additional means.\n"

    "body": "OK - checking with the notebook documentation, I see that that such cells are supposed to be passed on unmodified. Makes sense.\n\nThis wasn't a problem for me either - the fix was pretty quick. There is still a reasonable chance that a relatively naive  user will include underscores in a raw text field (I had been in the habit of using them when I didn't need markdown preprocessing). The inclusion of the underscore package in the preamble would prevent this from triggering an error, which I think would follow the dictum of \"least surprise.\"\n\nFor reference, in ubuntu, it's included in the texlive-latex-recommended package (as well as TeXLive and MikTeX). So, it's not guaranteed on super-lean systems, but is likely to be installed if you have installed LaTeX.\n"
