But without a way for us to reproduce it we're kind of stuck...\n\nOne way to debug javascript issues is to put log() calls into the code itself and watch the JS console.  Primitive (its' like a print statement in Python) but works.  I did that when I was making changes a while back to the keybindings code.\n\nThat could perhaps pinpoint what codepath is being taken in your case that is different from what it should...\n"
