Below are the outputs:\n\nBefore I call IPython from the command line, my prompt correctly shows as:\n`([name of virtual env]) [my regular prompt]`\n\nThen, once I am in IPython:\n\n``` python\nprint os.environ['VIRTUAL_ENV']\n# correctly prints the path to the environment \n\nprint sys.executable\n# Prints the external path to Python (?)\n\nprint IPython.__file__\n# Prints the external path to the ipython installation's __init__.pyc (?)\n\nprint sys.path\n# Prints the path to the site-packages folder from the virtualenv at the top.\n# Then the bin path of the Python's external installation (?)\n# Then some paths to individual packages from the external installation (?)\n# Then the paths to individual packages from the virtualenv (and it misses the virtualenv's installation of IPython, ?)\n# Then a few more paths to individual packages of the external installation (?)\n# Finally the IPython from the external installation (?)\n```\n\nIf I exit my IPython session, my prompt correctly shows as:\n`([name of virtual env]) [my regular prompt]`\n\nTo clarify, when I say **external installation**_, I mean an installation *_not*\\* within the virtualenv, and **not** part of a system installation either, but one that I have included at the top of `$PATH` and of `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and that I know works correctly.\n\nPerhaps there is an environment variable that I am missing and that is confusing IPython to believe that I am using the system installation and **not** the external installation that I want to use in combination with my virtualenv and that I include at the beginning of `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` ?\n"

    "body": "Thanks @minrk. `libsqlite` seems to be available to the external IPython, i.e. the one I run when I do not activate the virtual environment (although this is not the one from the system installation, since I have modified `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include an external installation at the top). That said, I guess that it's possible that the external IPython is using `libsqlite` from the system installation (probably from other paths in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`).  Would that be possible? \n\nEither way, thanks again for all your help. The original issue I reported is solved, so we can safely close the ticket.\n"
