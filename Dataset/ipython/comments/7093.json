With the changes here, specifically the new guid, we'd have to do a reverse dictionary lookup to figure out what needs to be removed.  I think to mitigate this, you could store the id in the view (like we were doing before).\n\nI think a line like this should do the trick:\n\n``` js\nthis.views[id].then(function(view) { view.id = id; });\n```\n"
