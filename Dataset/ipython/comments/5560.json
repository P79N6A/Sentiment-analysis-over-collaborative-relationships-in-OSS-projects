Or at least it size might diminish.\n\n> I only have my perspective to offer, but I certainly would not have learned about this feature from looking at Cython given that I don't expect to find ipython notebooks there, but I do of course expect to hear about killer features like this one in the ipython docs.

One of those would be to improve nbviewer and create a curated version of notebooks, add search, and so on, and so forth. It would be a much sane ecosystem that stuffing things in IPython that get released every 6-9 month.\n\nThat being said I have no object to merge this.\n"

The gallery is more of a \"cookbook\" approach, which makes it much less likely users will stumble upon new _features_ by looking there.  By contrast, the IPython examples are something I actually looked through when I discovered them, because I know I'll find new IPython capabilities there that are of practical use for me.\n\nAnyway, it's not a big deal to me personally now that I know about this feature...
