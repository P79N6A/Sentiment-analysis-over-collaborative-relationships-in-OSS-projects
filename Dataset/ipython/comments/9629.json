Note that as a slight improvement on backspacing the completion out, you can press up-arrow once to deselect the completion and get back to the text you had entered.\n\n@jonathanslenders would it be possible to pre-select the first completion in the dropdown, but not insert any characters until the user has confirmed it by pressing enter?\n"
