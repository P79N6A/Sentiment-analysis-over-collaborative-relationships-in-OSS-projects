The lower-level interface (`rpy2.rinterface`) aims at making any interface with R possible. `rpy2.robjects`, `rpy2.rpy_classic` (an implementation of the legacy `rpy` interface) are implemented using it.\n\nOn a related topic, there is a sub-package `rpy2.interactive` that could benefit from being merged with an ipython+rpy2 effort. As you note there are several possible ways to use ipython with R/rpy2, and the magic might only be one of them.

To some extent it is only a wrapping of R's C API (with few bells and whistles for Python). The spin off would a package offering features for interactive work (REPL interaction). The (very modest) effort currently in rpy2 looked for example at building `__doc__` string from R documentation on the fly when exposing R packages; something that is fine for interactive work, but would be an unfortunate performance penalty for general scripts. If rmagic and friends are kicked out of the ipython codebase, I am fine to have them in the `interactive` namespace, or out in their own package (and then I'll ask if some of the code currently in `interactive` would be welcome in that `ipython-rmagic` package).\n\n> So here is the difference in my mind as an R user: rpy2 is for using python\n> code to do R things, the rmagic is about using R code to do R things. Its a\n> somewhat subtle distinction, but an important one IMO.\n\nThe fact that rmagic is using rpy2, an all of this is implemented in Python, is blurring the lines you are drawing, if I understand it right.\nA general system for parsing and evaluating strings of R code is already in rpy2, for example. The callbacks for designing R GUI exposed in R's C API are also part of rpy2 (letting one build an R console or R GUI in Python - see http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2/doc-2.3/html/related_projects.html#embeddeding-an-r-console) \n\n> I think this is a valuable thing which should be considered for inclusion\n> in the rmagic (I'm certainly not going to go back to not using it!), but it\n> depends on the additional RCacheSuite R package, which has its own\n> dependencies.

The need for it will only manifest itself when rmagic is wanted.\nAlso, automating the download and install of an R package can be done relatively easily (for example\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/15761756/rpy2-check-if-package-is-installed ).\n"

Some of my notebooks are such that all the\ncode cells are %%R magics (other than the %load_ext at the beginning). Are\nthe analyses performed by those notebooks written in python or R? I think\nit is entirely clear as both a conceptual and practical matter that they\nare written in R, regadless of the fact that technically they are written\nin ipython and use rpy2.\n\nI admit that the %R line magic is much muddier and am perfectly willing to\nstipulate that that IS (virtually) equivalent to rpy2.robjects.r(...)\n\n I think this is a valuable thing which should be considered for inclusion\n\n> in the rmagic (I'm certainly not going to go back to not using it!), but it\n> depends on the additional RCacheSuite R package, which has its own\n> dependencies.

That hasn't been written for R yet, but we are supporting\nother languages at that level as well (e.g. Julia is using it).
