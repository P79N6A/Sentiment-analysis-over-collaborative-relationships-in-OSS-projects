Aside from preventing ugliness, this lets gives a mechanism for restoring to 'no-zoom', which this currently lacks (and I think is critical).\n"

    "body": "What a crazy pain.  I thought I had the svg resizing working properly now in FF+Webkit, but that was an illusion.  I have pushed it anyways.  The reason is rather subtle:\n- Unlike `<img>` tags, `<svg>` tags cannot be directly made resizable.  Thus we have to wrap it in a `<svg>` and do extra work to keep the `<svg>` and `<div>` sizes in sync.  This means I have to find out the initial size of the `<svg>` and set the `<div>` to that size.  For matplotlib generated svg, I can do that because they set the `width` and `height` attributes of the svg in points.  I can read those and use them to set everything.  The only thing that doesn't work for matplotlib generated svg it setting `minHeight` and `minWidth`.  This doesn't work because they have to be in pixels, but there is no reliable way of getting those numbers.\n- One might think that you could simple use the `width` and `height` jQuery methods to get the initial size of the `<svg>` in pixels.  In Chrome that works, but in FF they both return 0.\n\nThe current version works fine with svg tags that have their `width` and `height` attributes set (matplotlib does).  But those attributes are not required, so the following fails\n\n``` python\nfrom IPython.core.display import SVG\n\nSVG(\"\"\"<svg>\n  <circle cx=\"100\" cy=\"50\" r=\"40\" stroke=\"black\"\n  stroke-width=\"2\" fill=\"red\"/>\n</svg>\"\"\")\n```\n\nI see two options:\n1. We can try to figure out how to get the intial size of the `<svg>` in pixels.\n2. We can give up.\n3. We can simply make up default sizes if the `<svg>` tag doesn't have the attributes.\n"
