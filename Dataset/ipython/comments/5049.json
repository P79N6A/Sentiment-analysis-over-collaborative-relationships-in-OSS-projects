The ShortcutManager is a very low level bit of code that needs to not depend directly on Notebook/Cell/QuickHelp, etc. The usual way we handle this is by firing an event that the QuickHelp could watch for in ShortcutManager. Can you give that a try?\n"

For example: `Ctrl-m` not `Ctrl+m`.  I'm only +0.5 to +0.25 on using dashes to combine shortcuts, it's visually quieter and a little easier to parse the constituents of combo shortcuts. On the other hand, one of our shortcuts contains an `-`. I just want to make sure we're consistent everywhere.\n\nHere's are screenshots of what the two options look like:\n![2014-03-10-113245_560x171_scrot](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/118211/2377519/b8070390-a883-11e3-91b4-90f8f2c6dcbc.png)\n![2014-03-10-113213_558x161_scrot](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/118211/2377520/b8189b14-a883-11e3-96df-6e9cd5dda14a.png)\n\nWe could also <strong> combo constituents if that makes better sense.\n"

    "body": "This is looking just about ready. I think the last question to resolve is `+` vs `-` for delimiters: docs use `-` as delimiter, while shortcut API uses `+`.\n\nShould we\n- switch the API to use `-`, and just be consistent everywhere?\n- let the API support both?\n- use `+` in quick-help, because the border/background around keys makes most of the +/- argument readability argument moot.\n- just leave it\n\nI would lean toward either switching to `-` in the API or just leaving it as-is. Supporting both delimiters seems like unnecessary complexity.\n\nFurther options in the API that avoid any of the issues that come with using a legitimate shortcut key as a delimiter:\n- use space as a delimiter\n- use two characters as delimiter (e.g. `||`)\n- use arrays, rather than parsing strings\n"
