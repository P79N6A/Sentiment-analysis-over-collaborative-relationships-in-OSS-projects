The thing is that I wasn't using profile_default in this notebook though, but the vim bindings were turned on.

I've deleted my custom.js from .config directory but following the source (Ctrl+u) still links to the old one. F5 and Ctrl+F5 don't force a reload for some reason.\n\nI also have a (possibly related) issue that is creeping up with the vim keybindings in which the cursor display is 1 to several spaces ahead of where the editing is actually taking place. This only happens after a while of working and then I can't persistently get rid of it. It happens across sessions after a kernel and/or server restart. There aren't any obvious javascript errors that I see. Anyone seen this? I don't even know how to start debugging. Is it worth filing another issue given that I don't really know how to reproduce?\n"
