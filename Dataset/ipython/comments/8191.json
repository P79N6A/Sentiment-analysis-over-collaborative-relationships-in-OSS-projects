    "body": "This does fix some behaviors, but there are still some others that remain:\n- Clicking on save in the toolbar causes a jump because of the `ensure_focus` logic that appears in a few places. Let's try removing that stuff as well (it is super simple and only in a few places).\n- Hitting `esc` to enter command mode can cause a jump if the cell is large and not scrolled into the optimal position. The code that does this is carefully commented by me, but I thought that code behaved differently than it does now. It could be a browser change or my memory. @jdfreder do you remember how this behaved in 2.0?\n- There are still 2 calls to `focus_cell` in `maintoolbar.js` to manage the cell type and celltoolbar select menues. I am not sure how these will behave after we re-add those to the register_events...\n"

The behavior when focus is not sent back to the notebook when a cell is changed seems surprising, because you are operating on an element that isn't focused, and you can't get back to the notebook without clicking somewhere after making the change.\n\n2.x doesn't have register_events and doesn't focus the cell, which means the behavior is mostly the same as register_events + focus, except the select element remains highlighted, even though it won't actually receive keyboard events. I think register_events + focus is an improvement over the 2.x behavior.\n\n> Hitting esc to enter command mode can cause a jump\n\nFrom testing, it appears that 2.x has the same behavior on this as 3.0, so I don't think it's a regression.\n\nReading the comment, we are calling `focus_cell()` in order to trigger CM.blur, which in turn triggers command mode. I've updated the PR to blur CM directly, which seems to work, and avoids the focus call. This is the change that makes me most squeamish about backporting.\n"
