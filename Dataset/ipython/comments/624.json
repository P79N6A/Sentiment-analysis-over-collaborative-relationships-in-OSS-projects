Try building matplotlib master, or get one of the matplotlib eggs from Fonnesbeck's Superpack: http://stronginference.com/scipy-superpack/\n\nNote that IPython runs exactly zero objc code, so this is presumably a matplotlib issue.  You would likely see this same issue if you were running matplotlib from the pure Python command prompt (not that anyone would do that).\n"
