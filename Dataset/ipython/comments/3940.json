    "body": "> some red warning about rare python/ipython version everyone must read\n\nit applies to _all_ versions of IPython since 0.11, including current.  It should probably be a note rather than warning, though.\n\n> using small fonts on distribute and showing easy_install in bold when distribute guys shouts that easy_install is \"old and busted\" http://python-distribute.org/pip_distribute.png\n\nThis message has been extremely destructive to novices' understanding of Python packaging, and pip's lack of support for eggs means that pip is not yet a replacement for easy_install.  There are many situations where `pip install ipython[all]` will fail while `easy_install ipython[all]` will not, because the assumption of a working compiler is not a safe one for many IPython users.  Once wheels actually gain support, then pip can finally replace easy_install, but not before.  We should remove any mention of distribute, since it is deprecated now in favor of setuptools.\n\n> inline notes about windows all over\n\nI agree that the reorganization by platform is a good idea, but it probably won't happen today.\n\n> there is no complete picture of what you should do to get everything and working. package after another package though whole document\n\n```\neasy_install ipython[all]\n```\n\nis all you need to know in almost every situation.  `pip install ipython[all]` will work in many places, but not everywhere easy_install will.\n\nNote that the starting point for installing IPython should be [the website](http://ipython.org/install.html), and the page in the docs is meant for more detailed explanations. We should probably link back to there from the docs page.\n\n> Sorry for over-criticism, but it better be ready for masses (1.0 release)\n\nNo worries, but it probably isn't going to change significantly in the next 24 hours.\n"

    "body": "1. Starting point - website. http://ipython.org/install.html\n   Good boys always read (fresh) documentation first, only then go to install steps (listed in manual :)\n\nThe very first line of website install sections refers to documentation... saying \"our official documentation contains detailed instructions for manual installs from source, targeted at advanced users and developers.\" \n\nSetup.py sounds to be the easiest way to install IPython, but there are other options listed in Documentation as well. So does website install section, that has got only Anaconda, EPD and apt-get for linux. Why documentation has nothing on this? Do we need to update this page as well?\n\n2) Supported versions.\nPython 2.5 note looks much more clean now. Since there won't be new 2.x, supported versions could be listed in complete 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3 or compact 2.6 < > 3.2 style \n\n3) Setuptools\nThe very first, Quickinstall section starts \"If you have setuptools\" (and ends in another condition \"pip will also work, but..\") which does not quite sounds like a download instruction (user might skip searching for \"if you don't have setuptools\" section). Get / update setuptools might be a better approach.\n\nInstall.rst revision you pushed mentions PIP install problems with pyzmq , but in fact it has wheels support already. Talking about readline - it's there in linux, MacOS has libedit so only Windows left with pyreadline (exe/msi) then?\n\nShould somebody test 1.0 again all possible install options (and python2/3) versions?  Is there any install / dependency problems with Python3? Should you mention Virtualenv in documentation / installation? Not only it's very handy,  It also comes with setuptools.\n\n4) There is no poing in rushing for 1.0 release, but sooner Docs will be friendly and up-to-date, more users would be happy :)\n"
