    "body": "Hi Petrus, thanks for engaging with IPython! One of the reasons we don't do this out of the box is that it is not necessarily the case that the notebook server is running on the same machine as the webbrowser being used to view and interact with notebooks.\n\nWith that said, here's the code you'll need to put in your `custom.js` to get the functionality you want:\n\n``` javascript\n$([IPython.events]).on('notebook_loaded.Notebook', function(){\n    $('#kernel_menu').append([\n            '<li id=\"qtconsole\" title=\"attach a QtConsole to this kernel\">',\n            '<a href=\"#\" onClick=IPython.notebook.kernel.execute(\"%qtconsole\")>QtConsole</a></li>',\n            ].join(\"\\n\"));\n});\n```\n"
