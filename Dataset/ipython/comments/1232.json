    "body": "Mhh, I've seen this on windows as well, but it seemed like the problem was that startup is slower on windows than on other systems, and the dead kernel page triggers too fast.  I got it to work by closing that notebook altogether (with the 'kill kernel on exit' box checked), and then opening a new one fresh.  It seems that once everything had been loaded from disk, the startup was fast enough.\n\nHowever, it's possible that our logic for dead kernels is too aggressive; @minrk, do you recent changes in #1187 help on this front?\n"

    "body": "This is almost certainly the same issue as addressed by #1187, so I would recommend testing against that.  It's possible the changes there aren't enough for some situations, but the timers are tunable via the `MultiKernelManager.first_beat` and `MultiKernelManager.time_to_dead` traits for slower environments.\n\n@anderwm The reason there's no traceback is there's probably no actual error.  The \"kernel died\" message is triggered by the kernel's failure to respond to the heartbeat.  The cause is most likely that the kernel took too long to startup, and the heartbeat timeout starts counting the instant the kernel process is _requested_.  This is precisely the issue that PR #1187 is meant to address.\n"

After playing with it some more I have found that if I restart it 10-15 times It will work for a few moments, but even before trying to run a command it will die again and I will have to restart it 10-15 times.  #1187 did fix the problem on my laptop...which is very slow and old compared to this system.  It's a quad core, 64 bit, 4gb RAM...at least better than the junk I normally buy.  I also tried upping the time_to_dead config option to no avail.\n"

Edit--On further review the HeartMonitor.Period changes how long the first death takes accurately, however, after that death there comes a burst of messages.  Once you restart it 4-7 times you get another HeartMonitor.Period seconds to execute code.  If you make it really big(~100 seconds), the dead kernels come immediately.\n"

We hope to consolidate these things soon, so there will be less duplication.\n"

Then it seems to wait 5 seconds before dying again.  When it dies, I have to click restart several times before I get the 5 seconds again. \nc.MappingKernelManager.first_beat wasn't in the commented out default config file, so I added it.  I also tried setting them from the command line and the result was the same.  I will try updating zmq, I probably used pre-compiled binaries because this is a 64 bit windows box.  I think the latest version should be 2.1.11.\n\n@minrk Where does the log wind up (application.log)?  Specifically, the one created normally and added to by your debughb branch.\n"

Setting a long time_to_dead seems will remove the notification of a dying kernel, but then no commands will execute (\"[*]\" forever). \n\nI get the same results when using the ipython that ships with epd7.2, the latest version from easy_install -U, and the latest trunk :-/\n\nSide note: The same versions of everything on Win7x64 produce no problems. Everything works.\n\nThoughts?\n"
