    "body": "The `--script` has been deprecated in 2.x , that is to say since February stable release. It has been removed since long before. It is still present, but will be removed. We cannot not-deprecate as it is already deprecated in a stable version. \n\nThe post-save-hook is strictly more-powerful that `--script`, and if you have your own package that do whatever you can use `ipython notebook --FileContentsManager.post_save_hook='your.own.module.with.post.save.hook'`\n\nIt take less than 5 minutes to create a local package that get the functionality, and shouldn't take more than 5 to make a module that does that on PyPI. \n\nThen you just ask your users to pip-install it. And you can even programatically set up the post-save in the json config file. \n\nSo we will most likely not un-deprecate. \n\nIf you want to have your own package with a post save-hook, we can help you to set it up though. \n"
