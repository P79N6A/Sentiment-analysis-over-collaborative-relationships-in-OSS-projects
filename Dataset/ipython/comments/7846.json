    "body": "How many engines do you have? If it's less than the number of retries, the task may be waiting in the scheduler to be assigned to an engine. Engines that fail to run a task are blacklisted for retries of that task, so this will always hang if `retries â‰¥ n_engines`. If you set a timeout (`lview.timeout = 5`), you should see the result raise an exception that it couldn't find an appropriate engine within the time limit.\n\nThere's an open feature request to disable the blacklist behavior, since there are certain kinds of tasks that may fail due to intermittent problems, and it should be fine for one engine to retry the same task.\n"
