I would like the tooltip for the function to stay open until the closing parentheses are entered.  And if a nested function is typed it would be nice for it to behave as a stack and pop back out to the original function until all arguments have been entered.  The sticky tooltip is a little cumbersome since it does not close on its own after you are done with the function but you have to click on the 'x'.\nI forget how tooltips work in most IDE's but I think the behavior is like what I described.  Is there code in IDLE to handle this?\n"
