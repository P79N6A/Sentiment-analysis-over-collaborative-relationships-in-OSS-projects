    "body": "We already use `ensure_ascii=False` when talking over the wire. We could easily do this in nbformat as well. Since escaped unicode and literal unicode are equivalent in JSON, changing this should be transparent to any code that properly understands JSON, and the text encoding is definitely not part of the spec, so we could change the behavior in IPython without any effect on the spec.\n"
