I'll address this.\n\nI remember wanting to do as you've suggested and reset a flag upon the completion of a save.  But there was a reason, which I can't remember now, that I didn't: it was probably that I wanted to keep the change contained to that one function, or some notion I had of neatness!  Probably related to the fact that a failed SVG export still needs to return a string of XML, and couldn't raise an exception.  Anyway, I'll take another look...\n\nThanks for the feedback.\n"

This should result in exactly one warning on every failed save, regardless of whether the specific SVG failed to export in previous attempts.  This seems fine to me, because users should not be trying to export SVGs to PNG, and it's right to shout at them every time they try (as long as try==per-save, not try==per-image).\n"
