Tab completion is used very widely so we're pretty sure this is not a common problem, that means the only way to be able to pin it down will be with a self-contained example we can use to cause the crash on our systems.  If you can provide us with such a test case we'll be happy to dig into the problem, but without it I wouldn't even know where to start...\n"
