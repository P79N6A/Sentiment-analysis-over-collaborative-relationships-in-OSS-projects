    "body": "OK, I was able to install this in Windows 7 via VirtualBox, and confirmed that `FileLink` and `FileLinks` now work as expected on windows in the notebook and terminal. Also confirmed that tests pass on windows. This should be ready for merge.\n\nAgain, sorry for the delay. I haven't used Windows in years (and haven't ever developed for it really) so it took a bit of work to figure out how to do these tests. \n\nThis merge should address #2732.\n"
