    "body": "Yes, I mean that a buggy implementation would be worse than not having this, because people would try to rely on it. And I think that a bug-free implementation would be quite hard to do, because Python is so flexible. For instance:\n\n```\na = []\noptions = {'a': a.append, 'b': lambda x: None}\n\n\nf = open('some_file')\nopt = f.read()\noptions[opt](f.read())\n\nprint a\n```\n\nNow you have to track a dictionary holding a method which holds a bound reference to `a`. You don't know without examining the file whether the middle section will modify a. You could assume it always modifies everything the dictionary holds a reference to, but if there are long calculations downstream, that could get very wasteful. And this is a simple example - there's much more complexity I could bring in, especially if I got onto dynamic code (exec and eval).\n"
