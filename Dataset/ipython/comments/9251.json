    "body": "Any updates on this?\r\n\r\nI came across this issue when looking to see if there has been any support for mypy in the jupyter ecosystem. Seeing it approached as a cell magic didn't seem like the right direction for this as I feel that devs are either all in with the typechecking and want to run it on every cell or skip it all together.\r\n\r\nOpt-in support looks like the right approach but I am not sure exactly how. Potentially like @Carreau mentioned a line magic to enable/disable? \r\n\r\nAs far as requiring new infrastructure I don't think that is necessary, the error stream/messages look like they can cover this as regular errors rather than requiring something new. The only thing that I feel is important is that when executing a cell if it doesn't typecheck, _none_ of it is executed to allow using the run-cell functionality to check  errors without worrying about an inconsistent intermediate state with ill-typed code."
