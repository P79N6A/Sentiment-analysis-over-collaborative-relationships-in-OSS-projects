    "body": "> In fact, if I call plot(...) more than once, as in the normal usage paradigm, it should manipulate the same plot, but it outputs more than one plot at a time.\n\nThis is precisely the behavior I have always experienced in the notebook, so let's try to narrow down what it is about your environment that is causing this:\n- is the sympy code in your example relevant? (does the two-line cell exhibit the same behavior):\n  \n  ```\n  grid(True)\n  plot([1,2],[1,2])\n  ```\n- does this happen without any config, or any sympy imports?\n- versions of matplotlib (and sympy if it affects the behavior)\n- Does identical code behave the same in a simple Python script without any IPython imports?\n"

    "body": "Note that your plot function must be sympys plotting command from the sympy.plotting module. This is the only one accepting a sympy function and also the only one taking a ylim kwarg. Doing what @minkr  suggests using the mpl plot command I only see one figure. \n\nI guess what happens is that calling grid from matplotlib creates a figure when called as the first command, after that the sympy plot command also creates a new figure. \n\nRunning the same code in the qtconsole with% pylab qt I also see to figures. In addition running the code in \npure python and saving the figure after the plot command I also get an figure without a grid. So I don't think this is \na bug in the Ipython notebook. Rather this is a bug/missing feature in the sympy plot function. \n\nInterchanging the two commands I also get two plots in both the qtconsole and the notebook. \nIn the qtconsole one is blank and the other one has the desired result. In the notebook the two are just interchanged from the original result. I.e. the grid is still separated\n"

Perhaps the sympy profile should rather do\n`import sympy as sp` or something than `from sympy import *` but that breaks a lot of sympy examples. \nIn addition they should have used a different function name than plot. I also don't see a simple way to get the axes returned from the sympy plot function. \n\nA related bug is #2035 where importing sympy is importing matplotlib.pyplot and thus choses the default backend for mpl \nand breaks the tests that choses a specific backend. I fear that there will be quite a few ssues with the sympy plotting module \nand Ipython integration as sympy 0.7.2 is released. \n"
