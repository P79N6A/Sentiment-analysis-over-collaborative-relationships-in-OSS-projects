The reason is that the autodoc reST sections are a whitelist, and sections not in that list are omitted entirely from the sphinx docs.

It's running the lines into one because if it's not escaped as a literal block, so it's treating the two lines as a single paragraph.\n\nFernando, the `::` is indeed necessary if you want it to be a literal block in the sphinx docs.  Is sphinx supposed to be able to escape the Examples section into `.. sourcecode: ipython`?  Because that would be very nice, but certainly is not what happens.\n"
