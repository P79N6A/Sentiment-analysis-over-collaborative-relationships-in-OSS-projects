But there might be two bugs: It appears wrong that bbox_inches=\"tight\" resizes according to all text artists. Also ipython might just accept the size of the figure as it was specified in figsize and ask for the bounding box to be used as the size. Clipping text in the title etc is a result of the spacings not being correct. The figure should be as large as specified in figsize.\n"
