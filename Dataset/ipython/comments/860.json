The procedure I use now is to hit \"Print\" and then view the source of the resulting static HTML. I then strip off the body tag and everything outside it; what remains I paste into an HTML view. This mostly works, but there are a few issues:\n\nThis is a very valid usage case and the solution will be for us to\ncreate an HTML export that gives you a self-contained, properly\nformatted HTML page that you can embed in a blog page.  That is\ndefinitely needed.\n\n> - I needed to copy much of the CSS from various files into the custom CSS of my blog, and the rendering is still kind of wonky. It would be good to have a better-documented set of CSS that I could embed, and maybe even customize.\n> - Multiple figures in one cell are all rendered on one line, for some reason. It's a pain to manually edit in <br /> between each one. Maybe this is a CSS issue?\n> - It would be nice to put a newline or two after the opening body tag and before the closing, to make the stripping process easier.\n> \n> There's an example of the output at http://lighthouseinthesky.blogspot.com/2011/10/testing-whether-signal-is-broad-band.html\n> \n> ## \n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/860\n\n## \n\nBrian E.

Anne, let us know if it gets the basic job done, and we can then use it as the starting point for something cleaner.\n"

    "body": "- The IPython.nbformat.v3 subpackage has an infrastructure for notebook readers/writers.  We currently have one for .json and .py files.  This is the place to create one for exporting to HTML.\n- Exporting to raw HTML is not quite possible.  The reason for this is that we use a couple of Javascript libraries:  MathJax for rendering latex embedded in the HTML, CodeMirror for formatting the code areas with syntax highlighting, and A Markdown parser that converts Markdown to HTML.  We will have to figure out substitutes for these JS libraries in the HTML export.\n- There are two possible ways of generating raw HTML:\n\n1) First export to reST and then use rst2html to get to the HTML.  Some benefits to this, but the downside is that raw Markdown/HTML cells would get lost in the process (although I think that reST suports raw HTML inclusion.  Also, this would make it more difficult to control exactly what the HMTL looks like (IOW use our current CSS styling).\n2) Use a templating library to export directly to HTML.  I think this is very worth pursuing as a first line of attack.  The would allow you to simply recreate the right HTML structure with the proper id/classes and then inline our CSS.  It would give you exactly the same look as we have now.  We would still need to figure out how to handle MathJax, CodeMirror and Markdown though.\n\nI imagine that in the long run we will support both of these routes.  Once we have the writers in place in IPython.nbformat.v3, it will be a simple matter of incorporating them into the notebook server.\n"
