Anyway, I was trying to modify the existing notebook upload feature, to accept all kinds of extensions, and not just .ipynb. That's a security risk, yeah, so we could always include a list of commonly-used files, and let the javascript upload function check if the file being uploaded matches any of those extensions or not.\n"
