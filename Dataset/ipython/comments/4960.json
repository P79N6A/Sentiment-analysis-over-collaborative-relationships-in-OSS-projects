    "body": "(reposting comment here---I accidentally put it on the closed PR)\n\n`@interact` without arguments---will that use the default arguments in the function, or just use python 3 annotations?\n\nIt's been incredibly convenient in Sage to have default arguments in a function control the widgets.  It's a really useful shortcut.  Something like:\n\n``` python\ndef interact_default(f):\n    args,defaults = inspect.getargspec(f) # pseudo-code here...I don't remember exactly what getargspec returns\n    return interact(f, zip(args,defaults))\n```\n"
