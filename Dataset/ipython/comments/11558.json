    "body": "Thanks. One way to handle it could be to explicity check if `==` returns `True` by `if (old_obj == new_obj) is True`. This solution will treat some essentially equal tensors as unequal. Now, I am not fully aware of how autoreload works but it seems that in that case a new tensor will be created. This would be a little bit inefficient (compute and memory wise) but should not introduce any new bugs.\r\n\r\nIs this solution acceptable? :)"
