    "body": "Relatedly-- the drive letter is being completely ignored on Windows under ipython 5.0. For example, if I type `pd.read_csv(\"Z:/` and press `<tab>` it gives me completions from the C: drive, not the Z: drive. The completions start with a /, as a UNIX path would (e.g. `'/Anaconda/'`). If I type `pd.read_csv(\"Z:/folder_in_z` where \"folder_in_z\" is a folder that exists on the Z: drive but not the C: drive, I get no completions at all. \n\nIn short, combined with tmr's report, it appears that the path is being parsed as a UNIX path, rather than a Windows path. This is a new issue in IPython 5; tab completion was working fine under IPython 4.x.\n"

    "body": "I finally had time to start looking at the cause of the bug. Here are my findings:\n1. The text passed to the completer is split at the colon (`:`) sign, removing the drive letter. See [here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/completer.py#L267) and also the delimiter list [here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/completer.py#L219)\n2. Backslashes (`\\`) are removed. Probably because they are used on Linux to escape spaces. See [here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/completer.py#L732)\n\nThere is also the issue with `(`, `[`, and `!` being possible file- or directory-names on Windows.\n"
