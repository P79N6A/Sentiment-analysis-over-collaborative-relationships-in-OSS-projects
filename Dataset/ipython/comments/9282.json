My suggestion is that if you have something like that, why not have it be a contextmanager as well? Changing the dimensions of your plot is probably the thing I do most often (in connection with rcParams and working in Jupyter Notebook). No biggie, I know that is probably not something a lot are interested in.. I can certainly keep on using my personally written figsize() with no harm if you decide this is more bloat than feature. \n"
