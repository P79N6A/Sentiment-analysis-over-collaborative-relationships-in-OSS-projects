    "body": "We did support Python 3.1 up to our 0.13 release, I think. But if there's a bug in Tornado, you'll need to contact them. It looks like they don't support 3.1 ([here's a previous PR](https://github.com/facebook/tornado/pull/500)), but if you want to try, that's up to you.\n\nBut really, I think you're better off just upgrading Python. Support for Python 3 is improving fast, but all the projects I've seen take 3.2 as the minimum.\n"
