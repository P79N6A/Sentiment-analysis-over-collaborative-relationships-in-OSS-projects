That is, anyone can fork the repo, and anyone can put their own extensions in their own fork.\n\nEven if all we end up adding is nice shortcut syntax for GitHub urls, that would be an improvement, and it would still allow us to split the language extensions into their own repo, which I think is the more important point here.\n\nI don't see any reason for `%install_ext` to work with PyPI, because pip / easy_install already take care of that.  Extensions that people want to distribute as regular Python packages seems like a solved problem to me.  But posting and maintaining releases on PyPI is a shitty experience, and an extremely poor fit for simple single-file things like extensions, so I don't think it can be the answer in general.\n"
