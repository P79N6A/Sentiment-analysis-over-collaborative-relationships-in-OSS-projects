    "body": "Compatibility with some other software is not an aim in itself. I\nunderstand for IPython only certain features of Enthought traits looked\nattractive and hence were implemented, omitting, in particular, those\nfeatures requiring a C extension. I also understand that IPython\ndevelopers are focused on developing IPython. Hence the reluctance to\nadd features to the utils.traitlets package not needed for Ipython. \n\nOn your code example: True, notifiers resemble Python properties, but\nonly with regards to their behavior when setting the value. I.e. a\nfunction is called according to a naming convention when the trait's\nvalue is set to a different value, not the same value. Python\nproperties, in turn, are even triggered when the same value is set twice.\n\nOn Enthought's property traits see\nhttp://docs.enthought.com/traits/traits_user_manual/advanced.html\n\nThey combine traits with general Python property semantics. See the\nPython docs at\nhttps://docs.python.org/3.4/library/functions.html#property\n\nSo what I want is a trait featuring an on-value-read notifier that\nvalidates the value computed by a function, say, _on_value_read(). You\ncan do this with Python properties, but unlike traits they don't\nvalidate the computed value.\n\nThe class I am working on will have properties instead of data\nattributes. The get function decorated by the property reads from an XML\nor json document.\n\nLeo\n\nAm 19.12.2014 12:23, schrieb Matthias Bussonnier:\n\n> Traitlets should be fully compatible with Enthought traits and their\n> reason to be is to behave as Properties with validation of value.\n> \n> So I'm not sure what you ask for.\n> \n> |from IPython.config import Configurable\n> from IPython.utils.traitlets import Bool\n> \n> class Foo(Configurable):\n> \n> ```\n> value = Bool(True)\n> \n> def _value_changed(cls, name,  old, new, *args):\n>     print('value: <<',name,'>> changed from', old, 'to', new)\n> ```\n> \n> f = Foo()\n> f.value = False  # value: << value >> changed from True to False\n> print(f.value)  # False\n> f.value = '17'  # raise TraitError\n> |\n> \n> â€”\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/7269#issuecomment-67627116.\n"
