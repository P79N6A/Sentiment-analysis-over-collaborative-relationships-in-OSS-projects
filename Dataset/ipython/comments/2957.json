    "body": "This looks a good deal cleaner and smarter than what we had before.\nAside from the comment I made inline about an inverted test (which gives the wrong priorities in qt_for_kernel when nothing is specified), I think this is a great improvement.\n\nThe qt imports started as super simple `try: pyside except: fallback to PyQt+v2`, which was totally appropriate for internal qtconsole use, but the continual influx of cases where the priority had to be different kernel-side made these files grow well beyond their original intent.\n"
