    "body": "it's not that big of a problem - most of the time we deal with `plt` when calling plots anyway.\n\nThe reason this is marked for 2.0 is because we already cut an alpha, and then a release candidate for 1.0, and are getting feedback from people who are testing this heavily so that we can release 1.0 that we're fairly confident doesn't have anything majorly broken, and whatever limitations there are should be documented. Completion is a pretty fundamental part of IPython, and delaying this until after 1.0 will actually give us more room to play with it, try new things and really get this right.\n"

    "body": "Quick note, the code suggested above by @ellisonbg won't quite do the correct penalization, as it will make `%foo` sort identical to `foo`, but we want it to sort _after_ `foo`. We do need to put the `%` characters up at the end, as @dpsanders' original code did.\n\nThis alternative does the right thing:\n\n``` python\ndef penalize_magics_key2(word):\n    i = word.rfind('%')\n    if i in (0,1):\n        s = i+1\n        return word[s:]+word[:s]\n    else:\n        return word\n```\n\nand in fact has better behavior than the one proposed here in some edge cases. I wrote up a quick analysis with checks and performance [in a notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/6694143) so @dpsanders can check.  \n\nI would suggest using that code (appropriately commented explaining what's going on) instead. It has better behavior and is ~ 2x faster, in addition to being easier to understand for someone who's not  a regular expression expert, since it only involves indexing into strings.\n"
