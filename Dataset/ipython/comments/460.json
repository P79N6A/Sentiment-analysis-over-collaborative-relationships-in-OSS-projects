But I suspect that wouldn't work very well with an editor that can have multiple documents open, and that's most editors more advanced than notepad. But then %recall and %loadpy let you edit something at the Qt console before executing it.\n\nActually, the biggest annoyance would be macros - in the terminal, you can %edit a macro, and it updates the macro automatically. Without that, you'd have to redefine the macro, either from a string, or by %recall-ing it, editing it, running it, and grabbing it.\n"

    "body": "Blocking until the editor closes is exactly what we do now, right?  As you said, this often doesn't work as GUI apps (e.g. gedit) frequently return immediately if existing sessions do exist.  That said, many do not.  TextMate has a `mate -w` call that returns at document close, emacs seems to launch a new window each time, notepad on Windows behaves exactly as expected, etc.  Googling revealed that even gedit has a `--wait` flag in the current development HEAD, but not in any release.\n\nWe rely on users to have a command that behaves as expected in the `EDITOR` env variable, I think it's okay to rely on similar knowledge when setting the GUI editor.  It just means gedit is an invalid (or at least unsafe) choice for editor with a GUI IPython.\n\nI think the qtconsole should probably _not_ handle the edit magic in a special manner like it does now, but the zmqkernel should also not set the default editor from the EDITOR env variable.\n\nThat said, since the Qt frontend can be on a physically separate machine from its kernel, maybe the GUI launching the edit command does still make sense.\n"
