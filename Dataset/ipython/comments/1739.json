One small issue that I see is that if you keep a notebook open \nbut shut it down from the dash and try to execute code in the notebook afterwards the restart kernel dialog pops up as expected but if you press restart the cell is not actually executed until you rerun it but it appears busy i.e it shows up as \"In [*]:\"  until you rerun it. \n"

I guess if it's broken we do need to fix it, but in that case please open an issue about this so that we can return later to the problem (or somebody who knows more about browsers can).  I find it truly strange that word order can affect clicking response...\n\nFrom experimenting a bit with FF, it seems that it only responds to clicks in the area from the _start_ of the sentence up to around 260 pixels, which is ~58% of the 447px input area.\n\nSo I suggest instead the following wording:\n\n\"To import a notebook, **click here** or drag a file onto the list below:\"\n\nHopefully that will work.\n"
