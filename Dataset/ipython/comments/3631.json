I realize we need to stablize our CSS classes, but that is true of the entire notebook - but that shouldn't prevent us from encouraging users to do cool crazy things.  In fact, we _want_ people to use our unstable APIs - it helps us figure out what they should look like when they stabelize.\n"

It's a question of UI.\n\nIf you don't mind, I included your XKCD style into my css theme selector in [this PR](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/IPython-notebook-extensions/issues/4).\n\n---\n\nThe following does not argue against this PR, and are just thought of what can be done.\n\nNothing force us neither to use local-style, we could have styles on remote server that could be shared between nbconvert and notebooks. Like a style CDN. Well designed, those theme can also apply to other export type like PDF, I suppose you can ask tex to use Humour sans.\n\nWe also have to think of including CodeMirror theme switching into the mix.\n"
