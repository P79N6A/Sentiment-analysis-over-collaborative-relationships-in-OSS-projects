This doesn't currently happen.\n> \n> @Carreau, do you know a quick fix?\n\nHum, I think I understand  why, I will try to have a fix soon\nIf I'm right it should do the same for anything which is not a letter or an underscore like for example with the right custom variable defined at run time:\nto type `v.xcoor<tab>d+v.ycoord` you might have to type `+` twice, same for `-`,`/`...\n\n> ---\n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/1080\n"
