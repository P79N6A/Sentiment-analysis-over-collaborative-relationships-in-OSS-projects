    "body": "The `install_nbextension()` function has an optional `symlink=` parameter, and the docstring says you can't rely on it on Windows (it says that now, at least - it might not always have done). It looks like vispy is passing `symlink=True`. Possibly we should redesign that API to fall back on copying if symlinks aren't supported, but I think it's behaving as (currently) designed.\n"
