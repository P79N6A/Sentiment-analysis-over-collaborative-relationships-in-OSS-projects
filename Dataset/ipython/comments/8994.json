    "body": "jupyter/notebook does not have notion of profile. \n\n`ipython help notebook` had still references to profile, this was an oversight of the `notebook` package that should have been fixed some time ago. The various `ipykernels` you have can have different profiles if you like, but the notebook itself does now know what a profile is. \n\nI would suggest installing a second kernel with a different name:\n\n```\n$ python -m ipykernel install --help\nusage: __main__.py [-h] [--user] [--name NAME] [--display-name DISPLAY_NAME]\n                   [--prefix PREFIX]\n\nInstall the IPython kernel spec.\n...\n```\n\nAnd having this kernel use a spark profile. \n"
