    "body": "Looks like embed_kernel needs to support nesting, kind of like the original embed fixes I did (singletons r bad 4 u).  Same save/restore trick to the singleton infrastructure should get that part working but... more unsure about the parent poller threads the IPKernelApp instance - shouldn't it share that instance across embeds so the active one dequeue the parents?  ParentPoller's are constructed using the JPY_PARENT_PID environmental variable.\n\nAt present with qtconsole, it crashes starting the self.poller in the IPKernelApp.start method, because that thread is already started... this relates to the instance returned from the singleton and restarted here.\n"

The installation wasn't completely straightforward as I had to uninstall several packages from Anaconda (r-clipr, r-jdbc, r-reprex(with r-essetials), r-profvis. r-odbc and r-mongolite). Once the installation was successfully completed I realized that my Jupyter R Kernel was dead. The KerenelRestarter gives me this message:\r\n\r\n[I 19:37:16.496 NotebookApp] KernelRestarter: restarting kernel (1/5)\r\ndyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libintl.8.dylib\r\n\r\nCan someone help me with this issue?\r\n"
