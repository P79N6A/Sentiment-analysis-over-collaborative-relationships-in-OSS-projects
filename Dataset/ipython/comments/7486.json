(Agreed this is paranoia)\n\nI think I miss expressed myself with unsafe_body:\n\nImho :\n`modal({ body: '<script>alert('foo')</script>'})` should show `<script>alert('foo')</script>` and `modal({ unsafe_body: '<script>alert('foo')</script>'})` should execute the js, or whatever name we give it. \n\nunsafe usage  of modal should be explicit, safety should be default. \n"
