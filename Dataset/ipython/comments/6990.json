    "body": "Yeah, thanks for working on this. Question: does this PR create an actual\nmodel object for lists of children? I almost think that makes sense because\nthere are times where you have a list of children, but there isn't an\nactual view for the overall list, just the children. Makes me very happy to\nsee this though as I am working on something that will have lots of\nchildren...\n\nOn Wed, Nov 19, 2014 at 3:40 PM, Jason Grout notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> This PR attempts to factor out the maintaining of child view lists from\n> the WidgetView class. Advantages include:\n> - Ability to easily have different types of containers for child views\n> - Less code in WidgetView\n> - Most importantly, the ability to easily have multiple kinds of child\n>   view lists (for example, suppose you have a two-column widget, and you want\n>   a separate child list for the left and right).\n> \n> CC @jdfreder https://github.com/jdfreder, @ellisonbg\n> \n> ## https://github.com/ellisonbg\n> \n> You can merge this Pull Request by running\n> \n>   git pull https://github.com/jasongrout/ipython viewlists\n> \n> Or view, comment on, or merge it at:\n> \n>   https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6990\n> Commit Summary\n> - Refactor the do_diff and manual child view lists into a separate\n>   ViewList object\n> \n> File Changes\n> - _M_ IPython/html/static/widgets/js/widget.js\n>   https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6990/files#diff-0 (81)\n> - _M_ IPython/html/static/widgets/js/widget_box.js\n>   https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6990/files#diff-1 (43)\n> \n> Patch Links:\n> - https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6990.patch\n> - https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6990.diff\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6990.\n\n## \n\nBrian E.

It basically creates an object that represents a list of views that is automatically kept in sync with calls to the update function (giving it a list of models).  So typically you'd register a change handler on your model's list of children, and in that change handler, you'd update the list of views, like in `widget_box.js`\n\nI'm not convinced that having a separate model for your children list is the way to go.  Regardless, though, such a model could use a viewlist to manage its childrens' views.\n"

I'm fine with the \"clean-break\"- so much with the widgets has changed already; however, `do_diff` is still used by `update_classes`.  Maybe making it \"private\" is a better idea - `_do_diff`.\n"

I also noticed that your PR to this PR exposed some confusion.  The add handler to a viewlist takes a model and returns a view.  The remove handler takes a _view_ (not a model) and removes it.  Can you look at my changes to `widget_selectioncontainer.js` with that in mind?  I also think I found a problem with the accordion -- can it handle multiple children with the same model?\n"
