Or exported with nbconvert ? In live notebook have a look at wether [codemirror](http://codemirror.net/) support line styling. You probably want to play with [\"gutters markers\"](http://codemirror.net/demo/marker.html) to decide which line should be highlighted.\n\nIs @jhamrick using something similar for classes ? \n"
