    "body": "Okay, now they look more similar to Traits, thanks.  List/Set take single `trait` as first arg, and Tuple takes `*traits` e.g.:\n\n``` python\n\na = List(Int, range(5))\nb = Set(CStr, range(5))\nc = Tuple(Int,Str,Unicode)\n```\n\nFor traitlets consistency, however, I do allow them to be used as they have been - passing a single argument as the default value:\n\n``` python\na = List(['abc',1,2,3])\nb = Set([1,'a'])\nc = Tuple((1,2,'a'))\n```\n\nIn which case, no type checking will be performed, as no trait has been specified.\n\nAnd they all keep the `default_value` kwarg that all traitlets have:\n\n``` python\na = List(Int, default_value=range(5))\nb = Tuple(Int,Int, default_value=(1,2))\n```\n"
