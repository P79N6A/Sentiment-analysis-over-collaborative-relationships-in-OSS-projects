Instead of ignoring the blur event raised by codemirror, the blur event is acknowledged under all circumstances and the cell enters command mode.  This isn't a problem with the tooltip because it is never actually focused.  For the auto completer this was a problem, the workaround is to tell the cell to render itself as if it is in edit mode, event though it actually is not.  When the completer is hidden, the cell is returned to command mode.  If the cell editor is refocused (most often automatically after the completer is hidden) the cell naturally enters edit mode again.\n"
