    "body": "Yes, there are **only** 2 lines **for now**, but once #4067 is merged, that will be ~3500 more lines changes with  probably a big part incompatible with python 2.6 also. And right now I think there are more excluded folks using 3.x that cannot use dev version without a huge pain than there are people on 2.6. (agreed people on 2.6 might not have choices whereas 3.x people usually do have choice).\n\nStill thanks for the pull request, and I'm sure people will get hurt by the 2.6 drop. But we are still a small team and dropping support for 2.6 will also relieve us from a lot of burden.\n\nI hope it will also push people to adopt newer Python version.\n"
