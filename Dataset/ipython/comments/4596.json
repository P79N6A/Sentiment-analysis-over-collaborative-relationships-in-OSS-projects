If you want to align it table-style, use `div`s with [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html#gridSystem) grid classes, not custom CSS.\n3. We definitely don't want full date format with timezone, etc. For now, I would just match the format used for this value [elsewhere](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/html/static/notebook/js/savewidget.js#L155), and we can consider something like moment.js in another PR.\n"

I would think these should be span6 or even span8. The date modified and button area will both probably be fine with just 2 blocks of span column.\n- The notebook path and \"Date Modified\" header should be in Bootstrap column spans.\n- The vertical size of each notebook item is taller than is was. Not sure which CSS is doing this, but it should be fixed.\n"

I've temporarily given up on the sorting feature for now. I've made a short PR that adds an extra column to the list of notebooks and does not have any sort functionality here: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/5873\n"
