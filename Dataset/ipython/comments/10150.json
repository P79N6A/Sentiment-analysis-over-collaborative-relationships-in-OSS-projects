    "body": "Even a dead simple prompt-toolkit shell reproduces the issue:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n#!/usr/bin/env pythonw\r\n\r\n# Basic REPL\r\nfrom traceback import print_exc\r\n\r\nfrom prompt_toolkit.shortcuts import prompt, create_eventloop\r\n\r\nfrom IPython.terminal.pt_inputhooks.osx import inputhook\r\n\r\n_globals = _locals = globals().copy()\r\n\r\nwhile True:\r\n    command = prompt(\">>> \", eventloop=create_eventloop(inputhook))\r\n    try:\r\n        res = eval(command, _globals, _locals)\r\n        print(repr(res))\r\n    except SyntaxError:\r\n        try:\r\n            exec(command, _globals, _locals)\r\n        except BaseException as e:\r\n            print_exc()\r\n    except BaseException as e:\r\n        print_exc()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the latest IPython, the shell hangs at startup. It doesn't accept any input, and you have to kill it with `kill`. \r\n\r\nIf you use an IPython before this change, it works perfectly. Here's how I've been testing \"perfectly\", running this at the command line:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> import matplotlib\r\n>>> matplotlib.interactive(True)\r\nNone\r\n>>> import matplotlib.pylab as plt\r\n>>> plt.plot([1, 2])\r\n[<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x10e09db70>]\r\n>>>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThings it should do:\r\n\r\n- The plot should popup immediately, with a line.\r\n- The prompt should not hang (it should show the next `>>>` immediately, before closing the plot). \r\n- The plot should be interactive (try clicking and using one of the toolbar buttons).\r\n- Closing the plot should work. \r\n\r\nIdeally, I could just import this code directly from IPython (for now, I have copied the code without this change), although I understand that IPython only needs to support IPython. I realise that it works fine in IPython itself, but I'd like at least to understand why. Plus it sounds like you weren't really sure about this change to begin with, so maybe there is something wrong with it, even from the IPython side. "
