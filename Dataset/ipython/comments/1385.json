    "body": "This is nice, thanks.  I'm always struggling with fully sphinxified docstrings vs light rst.  Adding the sphinx markup makes the online docs prettier, but adds noise do the interactive view inside IPython.\n\nAnd you are right - a sweeping pass to cleanup any/all docstrings and/or documentation is always a great way for new folks to contribute.  Some of these docstrings are _super_ old.  Our documentation is still the biggest shortcoming in IPython, especially after the major reorganization in 0.11, which would love a matching effort on the docs.\n"

Eventually I'm sure we'll end up having an optional docutils-based tool to parse docstrings for `?`, that can produce basic HTML as well as a cleaned-up plaintext.  I think having to rely on full-blown sphinx for that task is a bit over the top.\n\nSo perhaps a good guideline is: plain reST for docstrings, fancier sphinx extensions OK for the rest of the docs themselves.  How does that sound?\n"
