    "body": "More as a lark than anything else, I started a general implementation of nbconvert importers, with an initial markdown importer:\nhttps://github.com/bollwyvl/ipython/tree/markdown-importer\n\nIt borrows most of its implementation language from the exporters.\n\nThis one handles:\n- markdown(!)\n- indented code blocks\n- fenced code blocks (with language hint, which it optimistically turns into a magic)\n- doctests in either of the above\n\nThere are some strange things happening: \n\n``` shell\nipython nbconvert --to notebook --from markdown notebook1.md\n```\n\nYou get, as one might expect, `notebook1.md.ipynb` and `notebook1.md.nbconvert.ipynb`.\nIf you run it again, you start getting `notebook1.md.ipynb.nbconvert.ipynb`. Haven't figured that out yet.\n\nInterested in feedback, will PR if there is interest.\n"
