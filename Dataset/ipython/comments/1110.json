Currently, the two we have are `%autopx` and `%loadpy`, which don't make a lot of sense in the notebook as regular code (it makes sense to use them, but it doesn't make a lot of sense to _save_ a notebook with `%loadpy` or `%autopx` in it right now).\n\nThe magics system is the next thing in line for major overhaul, and @fperez has a solid idea of what it will look like.\n"

Because of this I propose the following:  we leave loadpy as it currently is and create a new magic that is designed to work in the notebook that does something more notebook appropriate.  How does that sound?  What would that new magic do exactly?\n"

    "body": "Actually, slightly orthogonal to the above point, I think we should perhaps rename this to %load and drop the requirement of extensions/language.  Checking for .py means we won't read valid python files that don't have a .py extension (I have tons of those), and once we add cell-level magics, people will be even more inclined to slurp snippets in other languages.  A generic, language-agnostic %load would work for all such cases.\n\nThe only thing we may want to do is put a safety limit on it, so that if the file being read is longer than a certain size, we don't read it in (offering an override switch).  This will help people who may accidentally give the wrong path and point to some gigantic binary file by accident.\n\nPerhaps we should split this into two issues: one for the point @ellisonbg brings up above, and a 2nd for the notion of generalizing %loadpy to a language-agnostic %load.\n"

Go team!\n\nHappy hacking! :bowtie:\n"
