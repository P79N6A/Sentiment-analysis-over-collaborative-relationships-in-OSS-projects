For example, create a new branch named `rpush` based upon `origin/master`:\n\n``` sh\n$ git checkout -b rpush origin/master\n```\n\n(Works in recent versions of `git`, but if your `git` is very old it might require something more pedantic like `git branch rpush origin/master && git checkout rpush`).\n"
