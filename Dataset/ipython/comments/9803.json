    "body": "üëç to creating the eventloops if they don't exist. Otherwise, I think the `--gui` CLI arg will always be invalid, and users of libraries that start the eventloop if it doesn't exist would have to take an extra step that they don't need to now:\n1. create loop, only necessary to prevent `%gui` from complaining\n2. call `%gui eventloop`\n3. make library call that would block if `%gui eventloop` hadn't been called\n\nIf there are problems with instantiating the eventloop, then it makes sense to be more conservative and not enable them ourselves, but I'm not aware of them.\n"
