    "body": "I was thinking of a way to install an external profile into the correct place, both as a simple Python function, and as a shell command (`ipython profile copy /path/to/profile`).\n\nBut another approach might be for frameworks to provide a standard interface at an importable location so we could do: `ipython --pkgprofile zope` (which would try to find something like `zope.ipy_profile`). We probably don't want to depend on setuptools, though.\n"

    "body": "A while back we thought about this, and were leaning towards the syntax `ipython --profile package:profile` as a way of specifying package-provided ipython profiles.  And packages would simply carry in their own structure, a subdirectory called 'ipython' containing the necessary profiles (one or more).\n\nOne thing that is an issue, though, is that right now our behavior is to auto-copy the profile files on startup to the user's `IPYTHON_DIR`.  We obviously need to create these directories because we write to them, but I'm wondering if we shouldn't continue to resolve the reading of the config files from their original location, unless a copy is explicitly requested.  This would make it easier for users to get updates to profiles, which right now won't happen automatically.\n\nI think our current behavior isn't too bad for profiles we provide, since those are mostly empty.  But for package-provided profiles, I'm not so sure...\n"
