    "body": "Great, thanks.  If you want to merge, go ahead...  Quick summary of tips for merging:\n- use the \"Merge pull request\" button.\n- in the blue area, start by copy/pasting the description from the top of the PR.  That's typically a good message for the whole PR, though you want to edit it manually to read better, add any other info from the discussion, remove unnecessary detail, etc.  But it's a good start.\n- to copy the PR message, click on 'edit' at the top, so you can copy the raw markdown instead of the rendered text.  That will make things like bullet lists read better in text.\n- don't forget to add at the end \"Closes #NN, closes #mm,...\" for any tickets the PR may close.\n\nI'd rather you get the swing of it so we can better scale this process :)\n"
