    "body": "Thanks for the suggestion on the  .gitconfig file, but I'm not 100% sure we want that:\n- For files that  are meant to be used natively on Windows, keeping cr/lf line endings may be the right thing to do.  Anyone editing those from *nix will have a capable editor, but someone on Windows may be using notepad, which will get utterly confused if the file has only \\n\n- Blanket replacement of line endings on files like SVGs may also not be OK: the svg your commit modifies was actually created on a Mac with Adobe Illustrator.  If that tool produces natively windows line endings, spurious conversions of line endings on all commits are just likely to generate more noise than they are worth.\n\nThat's at least my impression...\n"

    "body": "We had some discussion about a similar issue at numpy-discussion. Chuck Harris found documentation for the svg format stating that LF is the expected line ending.\n\nThere is some discussion at http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitattributes.html . See also: http://help.github.com/dealing-with-lineendings/ , http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-config.html . It looks like the appropriate thing to do is to commit a .gitattributes file along with the existing .gitignore. In that file:\n\n```\n* text=auto\nmy_native_windows_file.argh eol=crlf\n```\n\nthat way git will attempt to convert all text files to LF, with the exception of any files that are explicitly marked for committing with alternative eols. Files in the working directory will generally still have native file endings (see core.eol and core.autocrlf in the gitconfig documentation).\n"
