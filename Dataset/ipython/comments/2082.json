One need to call it twice to get it on focus and be able to select\n    completion with Return. looks like zsh completer, not the gui drop down\n    list of --gui-completer.\n\n    This also try to split the completion logic from console_widget, and try\n    to keep the old completer qui around. The plain completer that never\n    takes focus back, and the QlistWidget completer.\n\n    to switch between the 3, the --gui-completion flag as been changed to\n    take an argument (plain, droplist, ncurses).\n\n```\n"

On neither of my 2 computers. \nI don't see any reason why it should do that, except a race condition in PyQt/PySide event handeling that erase the temporary buffer after a newline is printed, but even thought, the buffer is zero len, so it should not do this, and the clearing of the buffer is not made by bindings event...\n\nI'm thinking on what can be done. \nI would try do make  `_clear_temporary_buffer` no-op in `IPython/frontend/qt/console/console_widget.py`, (be carefull not to use the completer) and try again. Also look at wether or not the old completer (`--gui-completion=plain`) does the same.\n\ni'll see if I can get this behavior on a VM...\n"
