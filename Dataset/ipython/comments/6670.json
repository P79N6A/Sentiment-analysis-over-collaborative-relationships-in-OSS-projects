    "body": "@jdfreder I'm thinking about the implications of this in the notebook format, and any addressable output will be excluded from the saved notebook, at the moment. Could you make it so that when a cell gets a new output area, the ordering is preserved, and cell.toJSON includes the concatenation of all outputs. Reloading the page will consolidate lists of output areas into a single output area, but I think that's okay, because re-executing a cell effectively does the same thing.\n"

I can make a best guess, and save the outputs in the order that they were used.  How does this sound?  Right now, the output widgets have no effect on the state of the codecell.  I would have to change that, either add a way for a codecell to inspect it's elements, or keep a stack of all of the output areas.\n\nAlso, if I do this, I probably should make the output widget's persistence with the codecell's output optional- that way people can use the widget persistence API without having duplicated output.\n"
