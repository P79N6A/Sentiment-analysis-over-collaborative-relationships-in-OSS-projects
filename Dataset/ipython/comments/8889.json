    "body": "Thanks, this makes sense, and is true for most users, who assume it's being called in the notebook. It's a bit technically imprecise, though - the magic isn't actually what's responsible for failing to render, it's the notebook. If put through nbconvert -> tex -> pdf, the whole of latex is available. The QtConsole also doesn't use MathJax, and can call out to 'true' latex to render output (or use matplotlib, which has its own latex subset).\n\nSo maybe it's best to say specifically that \"The Jupyter notebook application only supports mathjax...\" or some such.\n"
