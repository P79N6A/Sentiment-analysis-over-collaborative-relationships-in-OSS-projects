I'm constantly getting bitten by trying to do\n\n``` python\ncomplex_function(some_arg, another_arg, data_frame.some_transformation(),\n                 a_kwarg=a_value, <shift-TAB>\n```\n\nAnd having it not work.\n\nThis did not work on the 2.x series either, AFAICT, but if the inspector is going to be reimplemented it would be awesome if it could be added.\n"
