Readline uses a callback interface and expects only a list of completions.  The printing/formatting of the completions is done by readline, not by us, and in a list there is no way of specifying what comes from where.\n\nThis would be possible, and it's a good idea, for more sophisticated guis that manage their own completion.  I'm marking it as a wishlist so we keep it in mind moving forward, though at the terminal I'm afraid we're limited by readline's design.\n\nThanks for the idea.\n"
