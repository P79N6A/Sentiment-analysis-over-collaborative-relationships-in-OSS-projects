    "body": "In our current model, the contents manager is expected to expose notebooks to the frontend with a .ipynb extension, but it doesn't matter how it stores them. If they're in a database, for instance, the `.ipynb` extension wouldn't necessarily be stored in the database.\n\nSo in your case, I would have the contents manager report notebooks as `.ipynb` files, but store them on disk with a .md extension, or something more specific like .ipynb.md, to distinguish them from other markdown files. I realise it would be a bit strange for the tree view not to match the filenames in your directory, but I don't think we want to break that abstraction without more thought.\n"
