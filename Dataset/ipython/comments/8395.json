    "body": "As the [docs says](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/1/interactive/notebook.html#raw-cells):\n\n> When passed through nbconvert, raw cells arrive in the destination format unmodified. For example, this allows you to type full LaTeX into a raw cell, which will only be rendered by LaTeX after conversion by nbconvert.\n\nIf you want somethings special, use celltoolbar, and tag the cells, but the behavior is correct. \n\nOutput from bash command or anything else is probably better:\n 1) as a `1bash-command` in a code cell, \n 2) in trible backtick code block in markdown. \n\nBut thanks for asking the question. \n"
