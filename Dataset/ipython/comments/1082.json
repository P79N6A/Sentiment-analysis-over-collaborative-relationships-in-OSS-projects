It is especially anoying when you start to correct what you typed and have the completer dismissed because you over `<backspace>`'d.\n\nIMHO, you _should absolutely_ have at least one indication of what was typed because the filtering is based on the result send by the kernel when pressing `<tab>` for the first time.\n\nIf you don't agree I can try to better entangle it with code mirror. And if you get a better idea of visual indication i'll take it.\n"
