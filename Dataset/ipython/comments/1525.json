    "body": "Thanks - in fact, we provide an API for this, a generic function that you can provide an implementation of for a particular type: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/utils/generics.py#L32\n\nI implemented the same behaviour for a pandas DataFrame if you want to take a look at that:\nhttps://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/core/frame.py#L4377\n\nNormally we'd encourage the projects that define the types to include this code (like pandas). We might make an exception for numpy, but we'd have to be careful because we don't want to automatically import numpy whenever IPython starts.\n\nI'm going to close this PR as there's a less hackish way to do what you want - if you want to include the code in IPython and you can work round the import issues, you're welcome to open a new one. But it might be best to include it in numpy where `recarray` is defined.\n"

    "body": "The way I implemented it in this commit avoid importing numpy completely though. But again checking this kind of typecheck is quite hackish.\n\nThank a lot for the examples. I googled around forever for examples before doing this. Now I know how to implement one using the API. I'd love to volunteer to implement this feature but I don't know where I should include this into iPython. \n\nWhat do you think if I implement this as an extension in iPython? That way I can even import numpy when the extension is loaded.\n"
