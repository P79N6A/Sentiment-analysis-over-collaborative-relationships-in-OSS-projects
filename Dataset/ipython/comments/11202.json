    "body": "Yes, it will try to compute the representation in all formats the object provides; you can `return None` from a repr method to indicate that that format is not available. Then the frontend picks which of the available formats it wants to display.\r\n\r\nYour repr methods shouldn't call `display()`; that function displays an object as a side effect - it's be like having a `__repr__` method that calls `print()`.\r\n\r\nIt's probably best to avoid matplotlib for experimenting with this machinery, because we have some special cases to display matplotlib figures. If you want to play around with a png image, have a png file on disk and read from it in `_repr_png_`."
