What I mean to say is that to support opening some plotting window _in_ the inline backend, if inlining is impossible (i.e., connecting from terminal).\n  So it is one backend for matplotlib, but changes behavior depending on the ipython fontend you are using.\n\nOr is it easier to implement a way to show image data in terminal frontend?  Probably it is better because it works over ssh and python modules other than matplotlib benefit by this improvement.\n"

    "body": "What I meant by calling a matplotlib backend from another backend was something this:\n\n``` python\n# mixedbackend.py\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    import matplotlib\n    matplotlib.use('module://mixedbackend')\n\n    from pylab import show, plot, randn\n    plot(randn(100), randn(100), 'o', alpha=0.5)\n    show()\n\n    import mixedbackend\n    mixedbackend.usewhat = 'wx'\n    from pylab import show, plot, randn\n    plot(randn(100), randn(100), 'o', alpha=0.5)\n    show()\n\n\nfrom matplotlib.backends import backend_qt4agg, backend_wx\n\nusewhat = 'qt4agg'\n\n\ndef new_figure_manager(*args, **kwds):\n    if usewhat == 'qt4agg':\n        return backend_qt4agg.new_figure_manager(*args, **kwds)\n    else:\n        return backend_wx.new_figure_manager(*args, **kwds)\n\n\ndef draw_if_interactive(*args, **kwds):\n    if usewhat == 'qt4agg':\n        return backend_qt4agg.draw_if_interactive(*args, **kwds)\n    else:\n        return backend_wx.draw_if_interactive(*args, **kwds)\n\n\ndef show(*args, **kwds):\n    if usewhat == 'qt4agg':\n        return backend_qt4agg.show(*args, **kwds)\n    else:\n        return backend_wx.show(*args, **kwds)\n```\n\nYou will see first Qt4Agg window and then Wx window.  I guess it is a very bad hack and not mean to do exactly the same as above.  What I wanted to show is that in principle, if you write a proper FigureManager etc., I think you can have two backends _internally_ and switching them depending on context.  What do you think?\n\nBut it will be complicated job to do and I was wondering if this complexity is worth having in IPython.  You will also need to implement X forwarding to use this complex backend over the wire.\n\nSo, maybe popup image is the better solution?\n"
