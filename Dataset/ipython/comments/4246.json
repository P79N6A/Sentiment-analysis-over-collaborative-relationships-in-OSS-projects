    "body": "OK I've had a look and I'm afraid I can't see an easy way for Edit with Emacs to deal with this use case. The text area isn't really a text area, it's a set of complex HTML markup that is updated by JavaScript (which it uses to update span tags and keep the input nicely contextually formatted). I'm afraid the only real fix would be for ipython to allow the use of plain div/textarea elements (perhaps as an option). Fortunately Edit with Emacs would track new elements added to the page so making it a simple toggle widget should mean it's picked up as soon as it becomes something Edit with Emacs can edit. \n"

EIN is also nice but it doesn't support many features I use in my notebooks (e.g. animations).\n\nOf course, I would be delighted if someone figured out how to chain these two steps together so we could add an 'Edit with Emacs' button directly to the notebook toolbar!\n"
