    "body": "Exciting!\n- If the output area is longer than the window height, we should put it into scrolling mode when it is popped out.\n- Right now the popouts scroll with the notebook page. They should be positioned relative to the window.\n- When a popout is popped out for the first time, it should have a position that is almost exactly the same as it was before. IOW, users should be able to see the output in the same place and that the output belongs to that cell.....then they can move it around.\n- Deleting a cell should delete the output, even if it is popped out.\n- I got it into a weird mode where an empty code cell had a collapsed output button across the bottom when it was created.\n- When a cell's type is changed away from code, all output should be deleted. This and the cell delete issue above, make me think we need a uniform API that triggers output deletion that includes popped output.\n- Outputs snap nicely to the side of the page. Can we make outputs snap nicely to each other as well to make it easy to create an arrangement of outputs?\n- If an output is really long and in scrolling mode, when you pop it out, the scrolling goes away.\n- The way the initial width of the popout is set is a bit wonky. Sometimes they shrink to the content, other times wide (pop out a scrolled output).\n- The un-pop (down arrow) button of a popped output is set at the top of the container. This means if the output container scrolls, that button disappears as it is scrolled out of view. It should use a different CSS position so it remains visible no matter how the output is scrolled.\n"

    "body": "Now that I have been teaching with the notebook for a couple of weeks now, and I think I understand what you are referring to when you say \"pager\", I'd like to make a couple of points, and ask a question.\n\nWhen teaching with the notebook, it is often necessary to keep the relevant part of the notebook on the top portion of the projected screen (so those further back can see it). One can make the browser window smaller, so that it only takes up the top portion of the screen.\n\nOne can use the \"pager\" area (I presume that this is the area that display ?help and ??help). If so, this area is useful to put relevant, but not critical, information, and it moves the notebook portion up. For example, I have been using it to put notes, or lecture overview... something like what you would see in Powerpoint notes---except everyone can see them.\n\nSo, is this area that this PR is removing? Will there be a replacement for this area? Perhaps it can be created and manipulated through CSS, Javascript, and some custom magic, if so? It would be nice if this area (and maybe other areas---rightcolumn, leftcolumn) could be defined and manipulated with metacommands.\n"
