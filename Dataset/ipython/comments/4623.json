    "body": "I think the docs should say something about closing a notebook and shutting down the server, but this is rather too specific. E.g. this says that before closing a notebook, you should save it using a menu item. But the autosave makes this unnecessary in many cases, and the browser should warn you if you try to close it before changes are saved. Also, there are at least three ways to save the notebook (menu, toolbar, keyboard shortcut), and I don't want to imply that the menu option does something different from the other two.\n\nSo can you have another go at writing this? I think the important points are:\n- Normally all changes are saved before you close the tab, but if the browser warns you, stop and save.\n- Closing the notebook doesn't automatically stop its kernel (but remember that people might not want to stop the kernel - there isn't a one-size-fits-all answer)\n- Stopping the notebook server is a separate action\n"
