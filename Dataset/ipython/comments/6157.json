    "body": "Thinking about the Jupyter Dashboard in the large sense, it needs to be able to manage notebooks for a potentially large range of types of kernels, and thus uses. Falling back to a command-line API to accomplish a \"move\" is problematic for a number of reasons. First, the commands would be different for each operating system. Second, it would be another \"language\" to teach on top of the language of the kernel.\n\nIt seems that a small number of operations would greatly enhance the Dashboard, without bogging down the overall project. Some enhancements I'd love to see:\n- date/time column for all files and folders\n  - have column be sortable would be useful\n- cut/copy/paste for notebooks (that could be the way to \"move\")\n- allow bulk operations (delete, copy, cut)\n  - select checkbox column\n\nThis could provide the infrastructure for others to add additional notebook management functionality (like \"diff\").\n"

    "body": "Some comments on the current file-manager (using 3.0.0-dev):\n1. The new contents web service mentioned by @minrk improves some things, but there need to be updates to the UI:\n   - create directory button (I was going to make a little script for this soon, shouldn't be too difficult)\n   - the text \"To import a notebook, drag the file onto the listing below or click here.\" needs to be updated to indicate the all files are supported\n2. There are other UI problems with the current manager besides missing functionality, not necessarily related to the new contents service:\n   - Uploading a file with the same name as a previous file will blindly overwrite the old file with no confirmation\n   - Uploading a file leaves the file list in a strange state, the new file is put at the top, above \"..\", and if it overwrote a file, both are on the list, this stays until a refresh occurs (in my browser I have to manually click the refresh icon although I though it was supposed to auto-refresh)\n   - The file upload text box should support hitting \"enter\" (or whatever would cause a submit) in the item's new name instead of having to use the \"Upload\" button\n   - The name \"..\" for the directory above makes sense to most people who use command lines, but there are plenty of people this will confuse. Using an icon (like http://fontawesome.io/icon/level-up/) and name like \"Up a directory\" may be better, or just skip it, you have the breadcrumbs already.\n\nBefore adding tons of features (and I agree that many of those are over-zealous, but do think some should be added) the ones that exist need to be ironed out.\n"
