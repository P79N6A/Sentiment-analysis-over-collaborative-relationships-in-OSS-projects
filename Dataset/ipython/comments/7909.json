    "body": "Heading cells are removed in 3.x, so all headings are handled via pandoc in markdown2latex. The h1, h2 blocks have no effect anymore. You can influence pandoc's handling of headings, though. It looks like to get what you want, you need only pass the `--chapters` flag to pandoc, which you can do by modifying the `markdowncell` part of the template:\n\n```\n((* block markdowncell scoped *))\n    ((( cell.source | citation2latex | strip_files_prefix | markdown2latex(extra_args=[\"--chapters\"]) )))\n((* endblock markdowncell *))\n```\n\nThe only difference between that and the block in the base template is the `extra_args=[\"--chapters\"]` bit.\n\nI've uploaded a [complete template](https://gist.github.com/minrk/a78c52034187e725d4df) that appears to achieve what you are after.\n"
