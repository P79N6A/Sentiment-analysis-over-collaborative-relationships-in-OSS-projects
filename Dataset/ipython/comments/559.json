    "body": "Essentially, the HTML notebook's ability to re-execute long blocks only helps in cases where you can enter long blocks, a capability only introduced by the HTML notebook and the Qt frontend. :-) It doesn't help in the cases that the OP must be encountering now. Unfortunately, those cases will persist in the HTML notebook and still be unsolved by the re-executing cells.\n\nI actually take back my statement about being able to do this by running the code under pdb. That won't work either. When pdb encounters an exception that bubbles up to the top frame, it goes down to the raising frame, but only in post-mortem mode. You cannot continue execution from that point. This is fundamental, and I don't think there is any way around it without major surgery to the Python interpreter.\n"
