But we need to\nensure that it does work smoothly without it, since in the past we've\nhad some problems with making this completely robust.\n\nGiven we're tight on time for getting 0.11 out, we might just stick\nwith setuptools for now (we've been using it on Windows for a while)\nand explore this post-0.11.  It's just a matter of available resources\nto fully test this on windows, I'm afraid.\n\nBut if anyone does make a clean pull request that provides robust\nscript creation on windows without setuptools, we'll obviously be\nhappy to test it and use it!\n"
