    "body": "@knorthover - this may be a zeromq-related issue, not necessarily unique to the `qtconsole`. Does launching `ipython console` work by itself? (This should start up a two-process ipython where there's a kernel that any client can connect to, and in this case, a terminal-based client which connects to it).\n\nIf that _does_ work, it'll print you a message like:\n\n```\n[IPKernelApp] To connect another client to this kernel, use:\n[IPKernelApp] --existing kernel-19881.json\n```\n\n**update:** On second thought, you can just run `ipython kernel` to get the kernel started up without any clients, and then proceed with what's below...\n\nThen, try to see if `ipython qtconsole  --existing kernel-19881.json` works, to narrow down if it's really a qt issue, or the qt startup code being unable to initialize a kernel, or something else altogether\n"

It turned out to be embarrasingly simple, I had an old version of the path library in my path and got bitten by the _isdir() issue with 2.7.3.   I've updated it with the latest version and it is working fine now.\n\nI apologize for causing all the alarm - what bothered me was that nothing gets reported by the console, \n"
