    "body": "> On a fresh windows 7 machine with a new install of everything\n\nWhat's \"everything\"? Because it seems probable that one of those things is modifying your registry and changing the mime-type for svg. What's your Python version (down to patch level) and distro?\n\nCan you run [this test](https://github.com/minrk/test_svg) on your machine? On My Windows 7 VM it works, but the mime-type for svg is also correct there (image/svg+xml), so there's definitely something different between your Windows environment and mine.\n\nOn further reading, it looks like there is a [Python bug](http://bugs.python.org/issue10551), where guess_type reads the Windows registry, but doesn't interpret it correctly. I'm not sure what exactly the right thing to do here is, but shipping our own mime-type registry doesn't seem like a desirable option.\n"
