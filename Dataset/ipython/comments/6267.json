We wanted to remove jquery-ui for a long time as it forces us to make use of 2 UI library, an boostrap achieve things with css that jquery-ui was doing using JS. Here I remove jq-ui  styling from some drop down, remove somme commented line that were using jquery UI, and remove a shim that mapped bootstrap classes to jquery-ui classes. All the styling is moved into the less file.\n"

    "body": "> Is there any remaining jquery-UI stuff?\n\nA bit, in a pager, but didn't bother because of \"Off with its head\", and as jon pointed out for now in widgets. Maybe a bit in dashboard I'm remove later don't have much time now. IIRC, that's it. \n\n> What's the reasoning behind removing a little of it\n\nTheses are leftover from transition to bootstrap. The theme was close-but-never-exactly the same and using javascript to set css is wrong (e.g the fading transition of notebook name on hover is a tight js loop that set `style=\"color:...\"` on the selector)\n\n> and replacing it with more complex CSS?\n\nThe css is not more complex, its just appear longer because the less compilation step blow up the code size to be browser independant, and animation is handled through css which add all these vendor prefixed stuff.\n"
