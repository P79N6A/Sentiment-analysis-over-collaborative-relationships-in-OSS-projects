For instance:\n\n```\na = 1\nnewx = 2\nnewy = 3\nC-p C-p C-a C-k\nC-p\n```\n\nAfter the last `C-p`, I would expect to see `newy = 3`, but I see `a = 1`. It's like if the last two statement where removed from the history, however, if I type `history`, I do see them, and after that I can see them using `C-p` as expected.\n"
