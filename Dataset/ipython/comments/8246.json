    "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\nThis issue has been quiet for almost 2 years, and I don't think there is anything we can do. It has been marked as no-action, and I'm going to close it to attempt to reduce the number of opened issue. Feel free to reopen if needed. \r\n\r\nIPython does not require readline anymore, it uses prompt_toolkit, and if you still want readline you can use rlipython frontend extension. \r\n\r\nThanks. "
