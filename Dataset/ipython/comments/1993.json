    "body": "My vision for the print dialog is that over time we will move to a statically generated HTML page that is 1) completely read only and 2) completely print friendly.  It should be a separate, static page that has little JavaScript and is also closely integrated with the \"read only\" or \"published\" notebook page.  Because of this, I am -1 on removing the separate print dialog page.  Using a static page will give us much more freedom and flexibility to tune the display to be print appropriate.  This is especially the case as the notebook gets more interactive widgets whose print representations will need to be different (maybe a static image instead).  In the long run, we may eventually _always_ use a pdf for the print view, similar to how google docs works.  In either case, I don't want to bing this logic into the make notebook page, it should be a separate URL and page.\n"

But you can open two pages type in [one](http://restimel.github.com/Tutoriels/webWorkers/channel3/index.html), it is received in the [other](http://restimel.github.com/Tutoriels/webWorkers/channel3/index.html), no server involved.\nWe should be able to directly transfer data from one page to another as long as they comme from the same domain. \nSo back and-forth might not be necessary. \n\nI'm thinking we could even make the pager detachable.\n"
