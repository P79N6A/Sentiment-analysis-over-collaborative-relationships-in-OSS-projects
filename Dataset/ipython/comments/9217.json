    "body": "I think Qt expects that only one Application will be created per process. The first SO question you linked to has a couple of workarounds - closing down the application instance, or reusing it. You can also run `%gui qt`, and then launch your app [like in this example](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/examples/IPython%20Kernel/gui/gui-qt.py).\n\nYou could easily encapsulate any of these workarounds in a function so you just call `my_run_qt()` to launch your PyQt code again.\n\nI don't think there's anything IPython can do to improve on this. Qt, as a C++ framework, was never designed to be run from an interactive shell.\n"
