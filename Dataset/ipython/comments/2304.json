    "body": "Thanks a lot, the problem was that my python install had several versions of ipython installed (from 0.12 to several 14.dev versions installed via egg and *.exe). After deleting every ipython file under \\lib\\site-packages and \\scripts and reinstalling a new version I was able to connect the engine to the controller.\n\nRe: the question about ip / port: its in the examples:\n\n```\nipengine --help:\n[...]\nExamples\n--------\n\n    ipengine --ip=192.168.0.1 --port=1000     # connect to hub at ip and port\n    ipengine --log-to-file --log-level=DEBUG  # log to a file with DEBUG verbosi\n```\n\nRe the ipython version: Funnily the above command showed a new commit (before deleting everything and with a still broken ipengine):\n\n```\nC:\\Neuinstall\\ipython>python -c \"import IPython; print IPython.sys_info()\"\n{'commit_hash': '06a7a57',\n 'commit_source': 'installation',\n 'default_encoding': 'cp1252',\n 'ipython_path': 'C:\\\\portabel\\\\Python27\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\IPython',\n 'ipython_version': '0.14.dev',\n 'os_name': 'nt',\n 'platform': 'Windows-7-6.1.7601-SP1',\n 'sys_executable': 'C:\\\\portabel\\\\Python27\\\\python.exe',\n 'sys_platform': 'win32',\n 'sys_version': '2.7.3 (default, Apr 10 2012, 23:31:26) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)]'}\n```\n\nThe *.exe seems to get a different version of the ipython...\n\nThanks again for your fast help!\n"
