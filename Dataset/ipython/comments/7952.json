MathJax takes a while to load but also some browsers (Chrome and Firefox) have not been loading big notebooks in a smooth manner.

    "body": "@rlabbe Yes, that is what I meant. As for the table of contents, the problem is that you want a global table of contents with links working across the whole book, right? I'm not sure if that is possible when you separate the chapters.  \nI think it is convenient to think about the benefits of pursuing a very granular global TOC that can be converted to PDF, because it might be tricky to do. Maybe you don't need a very detailed TOC. A reasonable compromise would be to include an additional pynb file with a TOC describing the chapters (but not subsections and sub-subsections and so on) and then convert it to PDF as any other chapter (example: [Numerical Methods](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/johntfoster/numerical_methods_book/blob/master/Table%20of%20Contents.ipynb)) and merge everything together to generate a single PDF.\n"

    "body": "@rsmith31415\n\nAh, but that is why we have computers, to automate all that stuff! :) I understand, you are being pragmatic, and certainly the Numerical Methods approach is not a bad thing other than every time you change something you have to go an manually change the TOC (I do have a [TOC](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python/blob/master/table_of_contents.ipynb) for nbviewer use). But, for a PDF, what I like is that when I run nbconvert I automatically get a detailed TOC. When viewing it electronically I can click on any line in the toc and it takes me to that page. Furthermore, on the left I get a nice collapsible tree  Those weren't invented in a vacuum - they were invented because for all the advantages you get in the electronic format you lose the physical indexing you get with a physical book. I.e. you can feel and more or less remember that LU decomposition is about 'here', and so on.\n\nAnd even the the TOC doesn't work _that well_ in nbviewer. If I click on John Forester I get this: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/johntfoster/  - a big list with no description. If I click on the Numerical Methods repository I get a big listing of chapters, and at the bottom \"table of contents\". I'd much rather see the info about the book at this level. - Something like a @brief added to the README.md file or something that gets displayed under the repository name. My top level view is even worse, because I have a bunch of sub-directories for support code and such. nbviewer just has no concept of a \"book\" - a collection of related notebooks. And then I have users reporting problems or asking questions - they can't say \"In section 3.4, paragraph 2, equation 3.47....\" because those types of references do not exist in the separate notebook approach. \n\nI somewhat mischievously suggest the opposite of your suggestion - it is convenient to think of Jupyter supporting longer forms than articles, and some kind of meta-information that allows you to associate several notebooks together as one document.  It's _almost_ there.  A nice way to specify sections or notebooks are prefaces or appendices (I hack this with some embedded latex, and a script that parses the .tex file), a footnotes and/or endnotes, spell check, citations, faster performance for larger notebooks, maybe more control over graph layouts (including figure labels like \"Fig 2.1 Number of bones given to dogs by weight\"), and equation numbering. But hey, everyone is hard at work doing what is clearly more important things like making it language agnostic, so I happily muddle along. Turning it into a proper book publishing system would probably break it for most users, I dunno.\n\nAlan Downey has written about this - he publishes [free books](http://www.greenteapress.com/), but uses the old school latex + separate code files + separate graphs workflow, but has mused about whether IPython Notebook would work for him. I prefer the interactive aspects of Jupyter, and the fact that I don't have to manually ensure that all the code/graph/text is in sync, so I strongly prefer this workflow, but it does break down when you want a true book format in the end. I suspect he can more or less send his tex files to the publisher, whereas I'm not quite sure what the process would be for Jupyter. Certainly the PDF output is not publication quality (bad layout, page breaks orphan things, bad graph sizing, etc). \n\nI do question whether PDF is even the right way to go for me. I asked another question about Bokeh output to PDF, and it can't be done at this time. I also use IPython widgets, which of course don't work in PDF. Print books are sometimes hard to use because the reader is so separated from the code and charts, and the genius of Jupyter is making it all interactive and responsive. And here I am trying to stuff it in a dead tree format! But, I do know people are opting to read the PDF form instead of the notebook form, and some publishers are printing and selling paper copies of open source books, so there is that as a counter argument. I should probably cut my losses and stick with HTML output ([mine is here](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python/blob/master/Kalman_and_Bayesian_Filters_in_Python.html)), but it has similar problems (no TOC, difficult navigation), so I'd have to script that as well.  Not the end of the world, but I want to work on content, not content delivery. \n\nAnyway, I don't know if the devs are interested in this discussion; they are focused on other things with broader appeal. I can mostly work around the slow down I reported. I reported it mostly because I thought it might highlight some inefficiency that could be easily fixed, benefiting people with shorter notebooks. And, obviously, I wanted to have this conversation about book production. I hope this doesn't come across as petulant - I love Jupyter, and am just pointing out what problems remain in the book publishing realm for me.\n"

    "body": "@rlabbe\n\nSure, the approach I was suggesting requires manual changes although I think it is not too burdensome because you're not likely to add chapters frequently.\n\nI agree that nbviewer doesn't have the correct structure to display a book properly, although I was thinking about the PDF version of your book when I was proposing to write a TOC in an separate ipynb as you already did. \n\nI would argue that users shouldn't have difficulties reporting issues because all your sections are linkable. However, in this case, the rendering of equations and figures is too slow that hashtag anchors don't work as they should (e.g. [This is a link with a hashtag](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python/blob/master/10_Unscented_Kalman_Filter.ipynb#Tracking-Manuevering-Aircraft)). So, yes, that's a problem.\n\nI believe there are markdown extensions to support footnotes and images have an optional title parameter to include a text in a tooltip (`![Alt text](image.jpg \"Optional title\")`), which already works in Ipython although there are overflow issues. Equation numbering is not working automatically although it is a matter of configuring MathJax to allow AMS-style numbering. I'm not sure if removing automatic numbering was a design decision, though. In any case, better performance when loading large notebooks would be a very welcomed addition.\n\nActually, I think that you lose significant functionality trying to coerce your lovely interactive book into a PDF. It is a personal preference, but I usually read the notebooks in my browser without even thinking about converting them to PDF and I'd like to see tools including new features that are possible in HTML instead of replicating features of the PDF format.\n"

You could generate individual .tex file of all your notebooks using nbconvert with a custom template (to remove the document class, preamble, begin document, etc.).\nLater create a master tex document which inputs all these individual files and takes care of the toc. \nThis a common way to structure large documents in latex, see e.g. [this wiki](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Modular_Documents)\n"
