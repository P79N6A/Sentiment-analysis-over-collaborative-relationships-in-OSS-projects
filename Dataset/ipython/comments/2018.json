Since it only seems to happen on XP, is fairly obscure and XP is by now nearly EOL'd even by Microsoft (only SP3 has any official support, and [only until 2014](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/products/lifecycle)), I'm marking it as low priority.  Nice to have fixed, but not something we need to lose too much sleep over.\n"
