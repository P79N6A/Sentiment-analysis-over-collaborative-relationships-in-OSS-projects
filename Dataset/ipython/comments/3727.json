    "body": "Speaking of ipynb -> latex: Currently, only ANSI colors defined in IPython.utils.coloransi.color_templates are allowed and converted to latex. These colors are manually added to latex using the color package, see ipython/nbconvert#173.\nSupport for 256 colors and 24bit colors, respectively, might be tricky as those colors have to be defined somehow in the latex preamble. Maybe the 24bit are easier as the RGB values could be parsed and used to define the respective latex colors.\n"
