    "body": "To me it looks like your latex installation is too old. Ubuntu 12.04 ships Texlive 2009 which is rather old. I think 13.04 has upgraded to Texlive 2012 however you should also be able to install a vanilla latex ontop of 12.04 and use equivs to fake the install of the Ubuntu tex packages for dependencies. I have done so in the past with no problems. See http://www.tug.org/texlive/debian.html\n"
