    "body": "I completely agree that the two sets of up/down arrows is a horrible user\nexperience - I don't think anyone can keep them straight.\n\nI like the idea of replacing the insert above/below pair by a single insert\ncell button - maybe a plus button?\n\nHowever, I think it is important that all basic notebook UI actions are\navailable in the toolbar or menus. Moving cells up and down is a common\nenough action that I think they do belong in the toolbar. One of the user\nexperience ideas that I think we need to strive for is that the UI requires\nno learning to get started. When users start out, they are not going to use\nkeyboard shortcuts at all - probably not even for running code. We can't\nhide basic actions such as move up/down from these new users - it will just\nanger them.\n\nAnother point is that I think the notebook needs to be easy enough for\njunior high-ish aged kids to be able to use with no instruction about the\nUI. As a matter of history, when I was first designing the notebook UI, I\nhad my 13 year old son play with it for hours with no instruction (I\nactually paid him!). A lot of the current UI design came from my watching\nhim do this. The current UI has some serious problems, but I don't want us\nto forget about non-expert users as we solve those problems.\n\nOn Wed, Nov 27, 2013 at 4:31 PM, Susan Tan notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n>    1.\n> \n>    I agree with fewer buttons and removing the move up/down pair.\n>    2.\n> \n>    I also agree.

    "body": "As a user of Mathematica, Matlab, and Maple Soft, I really liked having the insert up and down UI buttons. I guess I've grown accustomed to this UI feature as this is quite similar to what I've expect from the other platforms I've listed.\n\nIt sounds like most of you are gun ho about simplifying this bit of the UI, which I agree is best. But would there be anything for an advance user to customize or revert just this UI alteration within the config?\n\nWhen I insert a new cell or a buffer of empty cells, I like to quickly be able to generate a buffer for working area just above or bellow a cell I'm debugging. I suppose a good analogy would be when your writing a paper or report, you may like to hit the carriage return a couple times to space out some room in the cluttered doc for your new thoughts. Because code is a bit more sequential, I debug both above and below the portion I'm testing.\n\nI think the main issue is that as the keyboard shortcuts are a not as ergonomic or intuitive, the absence of the button in the newest notebook has hampered me a bit in forcing me to consonantly scroll around and select cells using my clumsy cursor (in order to insert multiple cells above). Something that can get quite tedious if you ever let your cell or cell outputs grow a little too large.\n\nI would suggest that a method of teleporting one's cursor from cell to cell could mitigate this issue, alleviating people everywhere from needing to use terrible trackpads throughout the world. Perhaps this would be best extended as a keystroke, but we all know how barren the available keys combos can be in a we-browser, as proved with the need of resorting to modifier keys (by the way, do we need to limit ourselves? I've used web apps that have broken this mold. It's annoying when a normal webpage kidnaps my key combos, but I've come to expect it when a web app does). \n\nMaybe 'Ctrl'+'B'+'up/down arrow' could suffice?\n"

    "body": "Right now, extending the toolbar is not that hard ( old example I should update): \n\n```\n$([IPython.events]).on('notebook_loaded.Notebook', function(){\n    IPython.toolbar.add_buttons_group([\n        {\n             'label'   : 'run qtconsole',\n             'icon'    : 'ui-icon-calculator', // select your icon from http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/\n             'callback': function(){IPython.notebook.kernel.execute('%qtconsole')}\n        }\n        // add more button here if needed.\n        ]);\n});\n```\n\nAnd as the all frontend is javascript/html/css, it is much easier to tweek that you imagine, you can see profusion of js extension if you search. \n\nIf you dig through open PR you will see that we are working on moving cursor/selecting cell etc. \nThe \"configurability\" is still a problem as we don't have a good way (yet) to send config from server to browser.\n"

    "body": "The reason all our shortcuts are horrible at the moment is that between the CodeMirror editor and different browsers, almost all shortcuts are already taken. PR #3605 will bring us the idea of editing in separate modes, so you control cells with plain keyboard keys (e.g. b for insert cell below), and hit enter to go into text editing mode. So I guess you could say that we're taking keyboard use more towards the power user cases, and the toolbar a bit more towards discovery.\n\nTurns out this UI stuff is hard. ;-)\n"
