We've concluded that the thing which has changed is likely the fact that the version of Python you were previously using was not randomizing its dictionary entries. This improvement was introduced in [Pythons 2.6.8, 2.7.3, 3.1.5, and 3.2.3](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2012-April/118676.html) in April 2012. \n\nI am closing this issue, as it is a Sphinx issue.\n"
