    "body": "Just spent half an hour to find the reason why I do not get html output anymore in qtconsole. What seems to be the problem? I never had an issue with html output, using it mostly for pandas. There I actually had to hack into the code to enable html_repr (just commenting out the if statement that asks if it is running inside qtconsole). There as well it was mentioned that html_repr would not work inside qtconsole but not really stating what was not working. For me it worked just fine until this change and I'm disappointed by this decision, since the html output of pandas DataFrames was just so much more compact then the raw output. So I will disable the patch in my local copy for now.\n"

    "body": "@bergtholdt : pandas felt that the HTML repr was bad enough, particularly for large dataframes, that they used unsupported APIs to disable it in the Qt console. Also, people are increasingly creating HTML reprs that use JS, which the Qt console can't handle.\n\nWe plan to at some point build an HTML-based console, which will be able to display HTML properly. Once that's working well, we'll probably replace the Qt console with a QtWebkit view of that.\n"
