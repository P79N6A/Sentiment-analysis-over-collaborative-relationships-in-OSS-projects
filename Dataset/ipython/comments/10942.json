But recommendations are only useful when everyone follows them.\r\n\r\nI see this as a \"poisoning the well\" scenario. No one will know what \"python\" does anymore, so the only way forward is to explicitly call python2 or python3. This doesn't hurt new projects, but it leaves whatever legacy code there is broken.\r\n\r\nIt may seem that this only hurts a legacy python2 codebase, but this hurts adoption of python3 as well. What reason do I have to install it on my system if it breaks existing things?"
