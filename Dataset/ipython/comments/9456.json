    "body": "Note to people thinking of implementing this: I'd like to see two things before an implementation.\r\n\r\n1. A persuasive case as to why this is necessary. BMP format images are not common nowadays, they are larger than other file formats and can be losslessly converted to PNG images (which are already supported). Given that every extra piece in the code is added complexity to maintain, is this piece valuable enough to add?\r\n2. If you do think this is worth supporting, should we add the machinery to send bmp data to the browser for use in a data URL? Or should we add an automatic conversion for bmp data to png data, using a tool like Pillow where it's available?"
