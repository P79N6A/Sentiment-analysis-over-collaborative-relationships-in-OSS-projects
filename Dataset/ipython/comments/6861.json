That would resolve to the directory for `IPython.html`, which to my knowledge doesn't have any templates in it?  Is the reason for doing this so that you can have Jinja includes that look like {% include \"templates/foo.html\" %} rather than just \"foo.html\"?  I'm not sure where that would be useful.  I guess if you have multiple templates with the same base filename?\n"

It sounds like the use-case made possible by adding the parent is overriding notebook.html with a template **that also inherits from notebook.html**, because you need a way to reference the parent from a child with the same name?  That makes sense to me and seems like a valid use-case.\n"
