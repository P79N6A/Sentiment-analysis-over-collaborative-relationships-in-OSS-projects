    "body": "The input transformers do use the tokenizer, but the bit that detects when to apply automatic indentation strips comments off with a regex. I hadn't looked at that side of things before now.\n\nI'm trying to work out if we can use the tokenisation we already do to pick up Python lines ending in `:`, to save re-running the tokenizer. It's slightly complicated by the fact that indentation is handled by `InputSplitter`, which `IPythonInputSplitter` inherits from. Also, token-based transformers could in theory modify this after we've scanned tokens - e.g. it would be possible to write a token-based transformer that added the `:` on the end of a `def` line if you forgot it.\n"
