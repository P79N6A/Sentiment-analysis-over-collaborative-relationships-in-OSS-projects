    "body": "It doesn't seem like the best idea to check for something that could be changed externally (e.g. if another parameter is added, or type hints in the signature). Since we're ultimately getting it by calling [`inspect.signature()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/inspect.html#inspect.signature), there's not really anything special about builtins any more as far as our code is concerned. They're just callables, which may have a signature. I wonder if there's a more reliable way of getting a callable without a signature.\n"
