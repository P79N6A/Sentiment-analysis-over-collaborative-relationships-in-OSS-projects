And doing it across different browsers, which deal with keystroke events slightly differently, is crazy.\n\nHopefully someone more involved with that stuff than I am (@Carreau?) will be able to help you debug it. I'm just warning you that we may not be able to fix it. ;-)\n"

    "body": "Thomas is right, javascript keyboard handeling [is a mess](http://unixpapa.com/js/key.html), and almost each browser/os have its own way of dealing with it.\n\nOne of the issues is that there is no real differentiation in js for the key vs the char that you press.\n(eg in games on qwerty keyboard you use `wsad` as arrowkeys, on azerty (french) keyboard you want `zqsd` to get the same 'physical layout'). Mouse and touch events are even worse but I digress.\n\nI'm working on making this more \"configurable\" cf #6700 and related for example, but as long as at least Microsoft, Google, Apple and Mozilla don't sit on a table, and decide to fix it by writting a standard I don't think there is much we can do. (Oh, yes, there is this W3C draft from 2001, whic is still draft).\n\nWith (a lot of) manpower, we could have a per-browser key handeling. IIRC chrome ave their own keys which actually convey really both keypress and corresponding char, but I'm not even sure it follows xmodmap, firefox might have the same, but who knows.\n\nIf you are ready to dive into javascript, you can try to patch/monkeypath `IPython.keyboard.keycodes` (`IPython/html/static/base/js/keyboard.js`) to map also to your keyboard.\n\nYou can play [here](http://www.cambiaresearch.com/articles/15/javascript-char-codes-key-codes) if you want to see the inconsitency between default keymap and your keyboard.\n\nAnd if you really have the motivation, long term plan would be a short extension the tell you \"Press Ctrl Key\", \"Press Maj Key\", ''enter the `/` char\" and create the map for you.\n\nWelcome to JSWorld !\n"
