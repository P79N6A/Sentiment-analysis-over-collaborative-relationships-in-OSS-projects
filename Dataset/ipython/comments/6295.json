Given the concerns I already had about code complexity, I'm closing this - sorry Erik.\n\nFor better version control of notebooks, I've just written a git filter that displays nicer diffs for notebooks (at the cost of hiding some information): https://gist.github.com/takluyver/bc8f3275c7d34abb68bf\n"
