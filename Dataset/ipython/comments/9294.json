    "body": "Hi!\nWell, there is a the way to integrate qtconsole without making an instance\nof the BaseIPythonApplication or IPythonConsoleApplication?\n\nqtconsole can be started with pyqt separately by starting\nQtInProcessKernelManager, then a separate kernel, client and adding the\nRichIPythonWidget.\nThe configuration/documentation on the process is pretty vague. Google and\nmy source code tell me it is possible.\n\nThere must be a way to prep configuration somehow on the profile to pass on\nto the kernel? It seems to me that it is what instance of application does\nwhen parses the command line arguments.\n\nOk. If there is really no way to do it, it should be a capability to start\nan ipython session independently and configure it for remote access.\nThen what is a python way for a different program to create a new kernel,\nconnect to that session inside the code without starting a\n BaseIPythonApplication?\nDoes anyone have an idea how to parse such configuration to KernelManager\nor kernel itself?\n\nThe final goal of the project is to integrate a specific ipython shell\n(spock) into another qt based gui.\nAny comments on this? I would really appreciate them.\nbest,\n     Konstantin\n\nOn Sat, Mar 5, 2016 at 4:11 PM, Thomas Kluyver notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> The kernel machinery doesn't know anything specific about IPython\n> profiles, you just need to extend the arguments with --profile foo.\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/9294#issuecomment-192670008.\n"
