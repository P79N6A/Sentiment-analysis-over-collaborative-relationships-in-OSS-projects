Right now, it looks like this:\n\n```\nIn [1]: from IPython.display import Math\n   ...: Math(r'F(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{2\\pi i k dx')\nOut[1]: \nFailed to render latex:\nF(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{2\\pi i k dx\n                                                  ^\nExpected \"}\" (at char 50), (line:1, col:51) \n```\n\nThe full traceback is logged to the terminal.\n"
