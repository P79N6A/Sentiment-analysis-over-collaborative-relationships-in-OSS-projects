    "body": "> but it is a stable release\n\nIt **was** stable. Unfortunately we are not that many people maintaining IPython and we even dropped support for Python 2.6 also a few month ago. So we cannot commit in maintaining older version.\n\nWe also tend to push people to update, so I doubt a patch on `0.10.2` will be accepted. Be aware that even patches on 0.11 have been refused.\n\nThough if someone maintain a patch version os 0.10.2 and would like to add a link to this version on the website or somewhere else, as long as it it clear that this version is not the responsibility of the IPython team, I guess it could be accepted. Also,  if a regular contributor express interest in maintaining a legacy version I suppose our politics can change.\n\nLet's see what other dev have to see about that (they are probably not awake yet). Maybe the BDFL would agree for an exception of including a patch in the source if it help, but I really doubt.\n\nThere is also those 4 potentially relevant issues/pull request: \nhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/4226\nhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/4215\nhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/4182\nhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/2666\n"
