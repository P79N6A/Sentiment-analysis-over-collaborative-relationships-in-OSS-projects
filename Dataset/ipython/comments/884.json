One thing to note is that to see the full effect, it's worth loading a notebook with very long cells, like the display_protocol one in our examples. We also adjusted the number color to be a subdued blue, that would stand out better against a non-white background.\n\nWe also played with the idea of using a yellow like `#f8f4e8` for the bg.  I kind of like it, but it may stand out too much for other's taste.\n\nUltimately, we'll probably want to allow people to load their custom CSS, because in the end there isn't really a 'right' answer to this: to a good extent this depends on variables beyond our control like people's monitor brightness, lighting environment, visual system and simple personal taste.  We can only find a sensible rough solution, not the ultimate perfect one for everybody.  \n\nLet us know if this looks reasonable to you. With @minrk's help, I'm fixing up the help button too...\n"
