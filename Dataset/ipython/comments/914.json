I know we have Extensions and Plugins, but those are too heavyweight for what most people want.\n\nIn fact, this is quite trivial to implement [see here](https://github.com/minrk/ipython/compare/ipython:master...minrk:startup) for a working implementation, but we should get consensus before adding something like this.\n"
