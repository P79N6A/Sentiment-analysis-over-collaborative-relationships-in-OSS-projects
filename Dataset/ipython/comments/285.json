The local/ssh/mpi switch is no longer available at the command-line, and must be specified in the `ipcluster-config.py` in `~/.ipython/cluster_<profile>/`\n\nthe scripts were refactored (a long time ago now), and we still need to update the docs.  \n\nThis is already reported as Issue #7\n"

    "body": "Honestly, I don't know of a better place than the `ip<x>_config.py` files that will be in `~/.ipython/cluster_default/` if you have ever used ipcluster.  We are in the process of entirely replacing IPython.kernel with IPython.zmq.parallel, but that has not yet been merged into master, so the kernel is not getting a great deal of attention, and kernel will stick around for 0.11.\n\nWhen you say \"ipcluster\" do you really mean the ipcluster script, or the whole machinery?  Because ipcluster is just a convenience script that calls ipcontroller and ipengine a number of times.  The ssh mode in `ipcluster` literally just did:\n\n```\nssh <host> ipengine\n```\n\nseveral times, which you can do just as easily with your own scripts if you want.  You will need to distribute the furls if it is not on a shared filesystem, as described in the docs, that has not changed.  The descriptions of ipcontroller/ipengine are still fairly up-to-date.\n"
