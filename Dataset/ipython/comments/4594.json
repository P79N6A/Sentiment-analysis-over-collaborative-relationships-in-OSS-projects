    "body": "The problem with the proposed change is that executing a cell is still destructive from the perspective of the notebook state, since at the beginning of the execution, we clear out the output portion of the executing cell. In other words, the scenario of having a really long-running cell active after it has completed, the user might accidentally push the \"play\" button which will lose the results of the long running computation and and restart it. \n\nWhat about moving the \"move cells up and down\" buttons between  \"save\" and \"cut-copy-paste\", since moving cells up and down in the notebook structure is much easier to change back.\n\nWith that said, I hardly ever use those buttons, and can see how this change would make it nicer for the \"stepping through and saving after each execution\" workflow better, so I don't have objections if someone wants to merge this.\n"
