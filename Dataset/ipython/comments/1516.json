    "body": "How does Gentoo install the package? On my (Ubuntu) system, running `python3 setup.py install` installs a script called `ipython3-qtconsole`.\n\nThe ipython[3]-qtconsole script is only installed when an installation uses setuptools, rather than distutils, and is mainly intended for Windows use - on Linux, `ipython qtconsole` is the recommended way to start it. Because installing on Python 3 always uses setuptools, you'll always get a Python 3 version of the script, but it should have the `3` suffix.\n"

    "body": "For every available version of python setup.py is eventually called like: python2.7 setup.py [options], python3.2 setup.py [options] and so on and eventually end up with ipython-qtconsole-3.2 script and no ipython-qtconsole-2.7. As you suggested, for python 2.7 distutils are used. If ipython-qtconsole could be installed for distutils variant as well it would solve the issue. Another approach would be from Gentoo side and just drop qtconsole script and inform users to use \"ipython qtconsole\" as you suggested. But setup install also .desktop files and also only for python 3. It would be nice to have them both for python 2 and 3.\n"
