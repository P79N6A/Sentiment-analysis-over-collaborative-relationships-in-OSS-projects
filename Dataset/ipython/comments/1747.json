    "body": "A configuration dialog makes sense when we have many more options -\nsuch as if we want to expose all of the configuration system with\nknobs and dials. The thing I like about menus is that they are\ndiscoverable. You can quickly explore all of them just with one click\non any of the menu items, and then moving your mouse around to look\nthrough all of them.\n\nMenus are more a more lightweight UI. With the current setup, you\nclick on the menu, move it to the selection, and click hsplit or\nvsplit (or move on once you've checked out the options if you're just\ngoing through checking what's in all of the menus) - that's one or two\nclicks. With a configuration dialog it would be click on the menu,\nclick on the dialog, click on hsplit or vsplit, click to confirm your\nselection - four clicks (it's still four clicks if you saw the dialog\nand decided not to change hsplit/vsplit, it's a click to cancel, and\nthe click again to get back to the menu).\n\nI'm not wed to this menu UI, but I think it's already better than what\nwe previously had.\n"
