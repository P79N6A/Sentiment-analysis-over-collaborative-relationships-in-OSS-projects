The windows ctypes stuff doesn't mean much to me.\n\n@jstenar: I'd just like to clarify: is there any version of Windows, any locale, or other setting, under which it could fail? I know that ctypes code can cause segfaults if it goes wrong, and I can't test it here. Also, is there any way to access this functionality through a library like pywin32 - even if we have this as a fallback when that's not installed? I'm a bit wary of relying on ctypes code.\n"
