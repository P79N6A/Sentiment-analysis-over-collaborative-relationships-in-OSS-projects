    "body": "Here are some notes on the layout and typography of the notebook:\n- We are using a 14px fontsize, with a line-height of 1.429, which gives a baseline height of 1.429*14px=20px. I think we should keep this setting. I am now setting this explicitely on the `notebook-panel` div.\n- I have added the prompt area to all heading/text/markdown cells. This narrows the line lengths of these cells and looks really nice. It puts the prompts in the \"margin\" of the page. The only confusion is that after a code cell, it is difficult to distinguish markdown/text/heading cells from output. To help with this, I have added a thin border between the two. It is not wonderful, but not too bad and does the job.\n- There is a lot of writing in the typography/design world about using this baseline height as a reference for the vertical spacing of everything on the page.  The basic rule is this: space everything in multiples or simple fractions of this size. I am trying to come up with a design that follows that idea.\n- I have removed the margin between cells and the overall look is much improved.\n- All cells currently have a 5px padding (inside their border). This is really needed to separate the selected cell border from the CodeMirror editor border. This is a nice number as it is 1/4 of our baseline (ignoring our 1px cell margins). Two adjacent cells will have two of these between their content (+2px borders), which is 1/2 our baseline.  Do we want to size this in em though so it scales with the font size?\n- I am experimenting with using line heights for headings that are multiples of the baseline height.  The non-collapsing margins and padding for headings should also add up to multiples of the baseline height.\n- I am experimenting with using a 1.429em space after p/img/table tags in markdown rather than just 1em. This does a better job of preserving the vertical flow.\n- The `output_wrapper` has a `margin-top` of 5px, that is there even when there is not output. This causes output-less cells to be 5px higher than needed.\n- Our CodeMirror editors use a line height of 1.231, which I have no idea where it comes from. We should probably use 1.286, which gives an even 18px baseline height for these editor areas.\n- Our CodeMirror editors have a 0.4em padding in various places. We should revisit that to see if we can make it a more even multiple of the baseline height.\n"
