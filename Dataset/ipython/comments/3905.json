I'm biased because I know the config system. Try to make a description of that before reading the rest. \n\n---\n\nIMHO it should be pretty strait forward. \n\nBasic : \n- Where are your configs files (global/qtconsole/notebook/...)\n- If you have none, how to create them/ locate them, but let's assume they exist most of the time, \n  just put a note with references to more advance doc\n- the syntax : \n  - `c = get_config()` at top. Should already exist.\n  - `#` is use for comment.\n  - usually `c.CamleCase.attribute = value` (most should already exist and be commented, just uncomment and modify)\n\n---\n\nWhat do you think ?\n"

In any case, the font has as much to do with the browser as any choice by an IPython developer. I was certainly not intending any disrespect to anybody -- I have voiced several times my admiration for the project, team, and amazing work that I was privileged to witness at first hand a couple of weeks ago (and hope to contribute more substantially to in the future).\n\nRather, I was doing a brainstorming session, as suggested by @Carreau , trying to put myself in the shoes of new users who want to use IPython and make it their own, but don't know how to go about that, and seeing how that could impact on the documentation.\n\nWhat I came up with are indeed FAQ's, in the sense of questions that people do frequently ask themselves, and wish that they had somebody _else_ to ask!

But it is not yet the case.\n\nYou should document from the more global to the specific: \n- All config value can be changed in the config file, and this is permanent.\n- Only a subset of config value might be set through `%config`, and may not survive kernel restart.\n\nExplaining the first is enough for people to survive, if you explain only the second at some point you will have to explain the first to people. So let's explain the first first, and live the second for advance usage.\n"
