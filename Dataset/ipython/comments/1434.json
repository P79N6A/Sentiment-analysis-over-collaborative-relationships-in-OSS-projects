    "body": "I think this is dealt with by setting high water mark, TaskScheduler.hwm,  in the ipcontroller_config profile. I encountered this issue with compute-intensive tasks of varying length, and wound up setting it to 2, instead of the default 0, so there would be no latency. (My numbers are 1728 tasks and 96 engines.) However your  case would indicate 1.\nIt seems odd that the default for load balancing is to effectively disable it, but Min explained that he was concerned with latency.\n"

All tasks are equal, and ZeroMQ fair-queues requests on the incoming socket, so if two tasks submit a bunch of tasks very quickly at the same time, they will be interleaved.  But this requires that they _really_ be submitted at the same time.\n"
