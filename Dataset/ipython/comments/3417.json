    "body": "I was halfly expecting that kind of answer.  But loosing sphinx's features such as autodoc for dev documentation is not the best choice, I think.  For example, you could link from the table of the URL mapping to the actual class.   If you want to separate developer's info from the user's one, why not add another sphinx document for developer?  You can also synchronize document diff with code diff easily, as I said.\n"
