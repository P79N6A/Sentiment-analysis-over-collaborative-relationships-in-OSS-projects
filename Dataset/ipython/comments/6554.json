Rather than putting all of these links, perhaps only if there is a help_links[\"About\"] link. This might be an easy way to find out if your kernel is up to date, for example (eg, notebook menu -> About -> dialog -> click \"About kernel...\" which the kernel maintainer would have a webpage with news, updates, getting started links etc)\n"
