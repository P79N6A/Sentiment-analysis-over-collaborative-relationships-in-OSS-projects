I've been thinking recently that, given the discussions we had at pydata indicating there will be no improvements to python docstrings forthcoming from python-dev ever, IPython should take the lead in offering documentation access to users.  \n\nSolid, easy to find help with good search and relevant examples is the one area where Matlab/Mathematica literally _mop the floor_ with the python tools.  It's not even funny how utterly pathetic our solutions are compared to what those environments offer on this front.  But I think we now have in IPython enough machinery (in particular in the notebook) to tackle that problem, and to start thinking about how to offer better interactive access to help.  Ultimately I'd like to do so for all the various projects, but we should obviously start by testing any ideas on IPython itself, before we suggest other projects adopt this.\n"

It didn't seem right that it was in the static dir, which looked too much to me like actually used code, and was available to notebook clients.  And yes, it is easy to exclude or include it from anything, no matter where we put it.\n\nPerhaps the most logical location is external/js, since these really are external dependencies (this PR now reflects this).\n\n@juliantaylor thanks for your patience, and all your packaging help.  Sorry for the bother.\n"
