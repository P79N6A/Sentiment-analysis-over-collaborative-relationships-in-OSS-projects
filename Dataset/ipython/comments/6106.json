    "body": "The layout of the slider is not actually changed.\n\nIf the slider is created with `readout=True` (the default) a label with the value is already displayed to the right. This just allows you to click the existing label and edit the contents inplace.\n\nIf readout is disabled, no label is displayed and this does nothing.\n\nThe use case is wanting to normally be able to try a range of values, in typical data-exploration style, but occasionally wanting to be able to cherry-pick a specific (probably round) value which mouse resolution makes difficult to select with the slider (eg, when you can only manage to select 99 or 101). This I would assert is something that people might want to do relatively often without wanting to go back and alter the slider parameters or set up a bound text entry widget.\n\nThe change consists only of setting the `contentEditable` attribute on the label and adding an event handler to detect a new value being entered.\n"

I'm not sure if this actually makes it more readable though - let me know if this seems a reasonable direction and I'll commit this to the PR.\n\nHey @chronitis , thanks for trying this.  This isn't actually what I was envisioning, I was talking about scrapping the use of content-editable all together and just re-using the numeric text widgets as readouts (of course with some styling changes).  I don't think this makes sense anymore, now that the slider widgets support value ranges.  I added a couple of comments inline, otherwise the code looks good.  \n"
