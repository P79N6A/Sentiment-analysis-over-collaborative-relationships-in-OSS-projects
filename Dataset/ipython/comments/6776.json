Leave everything as is.\n> 2. Leave the language info in the kernelspec, but move it into a sub\n>    dictionary, and store it separately in notebook metadata - kernelspec in nb\n>    metadata would just contain name and display name, and language_info would\n>    be a separate top level key.\n> 3. Move language info to the kernel info request, so kernelspecs\n>    really just describe how to start a kernel: the frontend asks the kernel\n>    for all info about its language. Metadata storage would be as 2. This feels\n>    more correct, but it would also be more disruptive.
