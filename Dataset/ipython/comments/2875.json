    "body": "Mmm interesting - I generally don't like them either, but there seem to be some cases that are difficult to reproduce in real tests, particularly when dealing with indirect output. There may not actually be to many of those though -- I don't really have a good enough handle on the code base to really know. Anyway, we can close this if it doesn't seem like an important issue.\n"
