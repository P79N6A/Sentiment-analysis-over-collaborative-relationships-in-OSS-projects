    "body": "Yep, but for the line-based frontends, we decide when a cell magic is complete and ready to execute by looking for a blank line. That also lets you use cell magics in a .ipy script. The code path for 'is this block of input complete' needs to be slightly different from the code path for 'run this complete cell'.\n\nAt present, my thinking is to have an attribute of input transformers that indicates whether they're used for completion testing, cell transformation, or both (the default, and what most will use). Then the rule will be that if your input transformer doesn't do both, it must be one of a pair that do both together. Once I've worked out the right API for this, I'll put together a pull request for it.\n"
