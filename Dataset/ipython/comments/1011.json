There's a quick and easy hack (until we have a chance to disentangle why the init file is being parsed more than once): write a small wrapper function in your init file (or a locally loaded utility) that simply tracks its own state and uses passwd:\n\n``` python\ndef password():\n  from IPython.lib import passwd\n  if password.pwd is None:\n    pwd = passwd()\n    password.pwd = pwd\n    return pwd\n  else:\n    return password.pwd\n\npassword.pwd = None\n```\n"
