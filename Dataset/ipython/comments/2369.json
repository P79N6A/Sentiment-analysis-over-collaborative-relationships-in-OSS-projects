SIGKILL is an un-ignorable, un-handlable signal: the OS won't let you even try to install a handler for it.  So if a process survives a SIGKILL it's because the OS kernel couldn't kill it, at that point something is probably _really_ wrong with the system and I'm not sure worrying about the frontend will help much anways.\n"
