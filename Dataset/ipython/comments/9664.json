Doable, but complicated. \n\nI'm considering pre-importing `prompt_toolkit`, and monkey-patching to replace the filters and have finer-grained control of when they return True/False. to triage more easily. still turning that in my head. \n\nThe diff appears to be wrong for whatever reason on GitHub, I'm going to mer that as it is an improvement, and we can iterate on subsequent PR. \n\nThanks !\n"
