I think the only outstanding questions are:\n- use options everywhere or just where more than a few args are needed\n- whether to use require abbreviations for all components, or just those that need shims\n\nThe argument for using options, even when there are only a few arguments now, is that it makes it easier to avoid breaking the API in the future. Adding a kwarg to options is less disruptive than switching from positional to kwargs once there are enough arguments to do so.\n\nI think both of these can be addressed in later, smaller PRs., and this PR is okay to merge once @jdfreder gets it back to a mergeable state.\n"
