That sounds like an issue with readline, or maybe with the Python bindings of readline.\n\nI don't think it's worth trying to document tiny details like this - the more docs we have, the more they'll get out of date. If you want a more visible record of it than this issue, you can e.g. ask a Stackoverflow question and answer it yourself.\n"
