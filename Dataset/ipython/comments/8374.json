    "body": "_Short answer:_\n\nI solved my problem by creating a new `virtualenv` only with the minimum essential packages.\n\n_Longer answer:_\n\nThe `virtualenv` I was working on originally was created with the `--system-site-packages` option. For some reason, when trying to update `pyzmq` it would download version 14, but it would keep using the previous version. \n\nAs mentioned before, I created a new `virtualenv` with the default `--no-site-packages` option, and then installed `ipython` and the required dependencies only. By doing that I was able to run the notebook server. Btw, the `pyzmq` version installed this was was `14.6.0`, so probably @minrk was right.\n\nThanks!\n"
