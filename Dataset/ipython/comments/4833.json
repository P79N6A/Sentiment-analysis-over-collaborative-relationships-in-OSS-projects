Plus, I don't think it's standard for webservers to make all system javascript available, so that doesn't seem like the right thing to do. If users want to serve /usr/share/javascript, this can be done via the extra_static_paths configurable or a symlink in ~/.ipython/nbextensions.\n\nWe can always revisit the best ways to minimize the packaging pain for you guys.\n"
