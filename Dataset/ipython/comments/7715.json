    "body": "I'm not really sure all tha make sens. \n\nfirst, this would be a magic, and I'm not really sure a kernel can restart itself as another process in a reliable manner. And any way if this is done as a magic, it shoudl probably be better as a separate package. If you need some extra abstraction in IPython do do it, then we can discuss adding them.\n\nAlso the description seem like it fits well the notion of multiple kernels and the dropdown we have now in IPython 3, so I really doubt the magic would be usefull. \n\nSo while @jdfreder tags this as wishlist, I would be inclined to say that this is covered by kernels and close. \n"

Both technically and in terms of the interface - specifying a path to a virtualenv won't work when someone runs the notebook on another computer. Also, there are multiple efforts in this space (virtualenvs, conda, hashdist), and we should let them explore different approaches.\n\nYou might be interested in talking to @ahmadia, who is working on ideas for recreating an appropriate hashdist environment to run a notebook in.\n\nClosing for now, we can reopen if people disagree.\n"
