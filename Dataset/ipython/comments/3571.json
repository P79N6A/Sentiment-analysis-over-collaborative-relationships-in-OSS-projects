I fundamentally disagree with you in **that** ;-) \nMaybe is a _bias_ in my way to use the notebook, but I think a lot of people will find very very useful to have the split/merge functions linking to keyboard events because is a very recurrent event in the workflow of writing, editing and formatting a ipynb.\nI don't know what is the current _status_ of the dual-mode editor... we talked about getting it ready for 1.0, but I don't know how advanced is @ellisonbg in this modification... if the dual-mode is ready for 1.0, we can for sure wait for this and make what you suggested, but if it is not ready for 1.0, I think would be appropriate to have the shortcut for split/merge done in the current status of hard coded keyboard shortcuts.\nI mean, hard-coded or after dual-mode, I think the the split/merge functions **need** shortcuts for the 1.0 release.\n"

This isn't unusual: e.g. in GMail, I can normally type 'c'\nto start composing a new e-mail. But if I'm already writing an e-mail,\ntyping 'c' just adds a c in the message. I guess we'll add some similar\nsingle-key shortcuts which only apply when you're not entering text.\n\nFor reference, the 'dual-mode' behaviour (I'm trying to avoid calling it\nthat) is characteristic of vim, though apparently Emacs also has something\nsimilar.\n"
