    "body": "Yes, we are aware that password should be stored as blowfish, or other \"slow\" algorithm. \nThe question is how do you tell IPython which library to use for which scheme ?\npasslib or cryptography ?\n\nWe are not either storing thousand of user password, and in multi-user context, Jupyterhub use pluggable auth, so this will most likely be more secure.\n\nThere are also probably more security things that could be better designed like PFS, and  ciphers we accept. \n\nI suppose a PR that add the possibility to do that would be accepted, but I doubt passwd encryption is the weaker place in the security chain. \n"
