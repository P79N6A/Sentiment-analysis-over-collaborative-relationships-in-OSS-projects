The kernel-level behavior just really needs a change, and the notebook can wait for us to do it right in the Kernel.\n\nThe current default behavior is so rarely the right choice in practice that I think we should do something like explicitly add the 'abort_on_exception' flag to the execution_request.  It is a bit peculiar, because it is the _raising_ cell that determines whether later tasks should be aborted, rather than the aborted tasks themselves.\n"

As for the new JupyterLab interface, these features are also being discussed on its own issue tracker (https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/4496, https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/2412). Does this mean this issue can be closed?"
