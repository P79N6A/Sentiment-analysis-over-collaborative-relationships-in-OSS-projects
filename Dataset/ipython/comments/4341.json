    "body": "That's interesting, because people often consider it more Pythonic to catch an exception than to check for something. People say it's 'easier to ask forgiveness than permission', or sometimes EAFP for short.\n\nWe'd accept new code written either way, but I don't think we're interested in going through and changing things like this, so I'm going to close this PR. If you'd like to find simple ways to contribute, why not have a look at some of our [issues tagged quickfix](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues?direction=desc&labels=quickfix&page=1&sort=updated&state=open)?\n"

    "body": "Agreed. For me the major objective was avoiding extra indentation/branching of code. Although, in this case it was saving only one line of code, so probably not really worth it.\n\nThanks for the pointer to quickfix, I will have a look. \n"
