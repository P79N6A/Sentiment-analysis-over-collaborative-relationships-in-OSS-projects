    "body": "@gnestor good question! I don't know what the current state of demand is for MathML support. I haven't noticed demand coming from the IPython side for producing MathML more conveniently. The general support in Jupyter is motivated primarily by @poke1024's mathics kernel, I believe, which is why I would like to know how significant the distinction is between MathML as a snippet mimetype vs an HTML element.\n"

    "body": "@minrk @gnestor I'm sorry for not answering sooner. For Mathics alone, a dedicated MathML type is not an advantage in terms of clarity, since Mathics (speaking from its current design) will sometimes output MathML that contains SVGs that (using foreignObjects) contains HTML that contains, again, MathML that contains SVGs and so on. We do this to mix formula and graphics content, so graphics (SVG) might contain some MathML formula text than in turn might contain some graphics again (for example an exponent that is not a letter but an image); the output might end up being a wild mix of formats embedded into each other that stresses the content standards involved to its limits. The whole thing is, on the outer level, just a block of HTML.\n\nThis is a very special case, I believe. Most other kernels using math output will probably stick to very clean MathML-only content. Yet, as you said, it's hard to tell, as long as there are no other users.\n"
