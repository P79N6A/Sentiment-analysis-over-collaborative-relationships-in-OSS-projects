    "body": "I'm not sure I agree: a print view with multi-thousand line cells will be just as bad as a notebook with the same: an unmanageable scrolling mess.  The issue seems to be rather that everyone has a different threshold for their ideal value, so ultimately what we need to do is expose UI for the users to configure this or even disable it easily while using the notebook.\n\nI'm closing this one but will open the enhancement request that will be a better solution long-term.\n"
