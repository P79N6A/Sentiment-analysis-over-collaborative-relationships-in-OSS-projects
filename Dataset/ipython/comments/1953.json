With the multiuser notebook we will need to rethink how we manage sharing and static views, but that will likely be handled by the multiuser part of the server. Should we just remove the last remnants of the read_only stuff from the single user server and be done with it? Should we actually re-add a nbconvert generated static view?\n"
