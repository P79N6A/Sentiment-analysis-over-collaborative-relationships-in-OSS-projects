    "body": "You can use an iframe. We have some plans for integrating multiple components on one page, but that's still some way off.\n\nThe main reason we added the terminal and the text editor is for when IPython is running on a remote server, e.g. for a university class, so people can do basic things outside the notebook without needing ssh access as well. When it's running locally, there's no real advantage to using them over your regular terminal and text editor.\n\n[Spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder) is the IDE usually recommended for scientific work - it has features similar to the Matlab IDE and Rstudio, I think. [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) has support for IPython notebooks, though I'm not sure how well that works.\n"

I've used Spyder before and it wasn't my preference. But then again, I feel that way about most Python IDE's. I will try iframe for now.\nBest wishes\n"
