    "body": "Hi, \nSorry about the data loss.\nI don't quite understand what might have happend. \nUsually the 'conversion' process, is just the fact that the new version does not 'save' the with the same format than the old one but can read the old one. It your notebook was showing correctly it should have saved correctly.\n\n> Is there anywhere some log of information that would help you guys? The console from where I launched the notebook server does not indicate any problem.\n\nMy guess is that if there are some logs they where on the JS console which is probably gone by now.\n\n> I don't know if it plays a role that I used the Firefox remotely and it was a bit slow?\n\nIt shouldn't play a big role, maybe cached version of old JS files, but it seem strange. \n\nlet see how what we can do to help for next version upgrade.\n- make backup of converted files\n- make a 2 step dialog with \"considere dooing a backup\" and \" are you sure you want to save\"\n- a way to redirect `console.log` and JS traceback to server for later analyse ?\n"
