    "body": "The proximate cause of the problem is that you're using an en dash instead of a hyphen in your command. Look closely at `â€“-plab`, the first dash is longer. You probably copied at some point from a program that helpfully changed it. Type the dashes at the command line and it should work. We should have  a better error message for that case, though.\n\nWe also don't recommend starting the notebook with `--pylab`, because there's no visible sign in the notebooks that they should be run with pylab enabled. There's a `%pylab` magic you can use within the notebook instead.\n"

I propose we just close this with milestone \"no action\".\n"
