    "body": "I agree with @minrk that the different borders all have to be the same\nsize. With this in mind, I think that 4px is too large for all borders.\nMaybe give 2 px a shot though. It might be OK.\n\nBut my initial bias is to not make any changes. The reason I feel this way\nis that I think for UI elements that change often (flashing) we want to err\non the side of being too subtle. It people want to add more bold styling,\nthat is easy to do in the custom.css.\n\nI also think we need to let people use the new UI for a while before we\nmake any changes. We just need lots and lots of user feedback and that\ntakes time. Probably the most important thing is for people to try out\ndifferent things on their own to see what works well.\n\nI should also note that a number of us use non-default styling on our\nnotebooks - especially @minrk. I don't necessarily think that implies a\nfailure of the default design. Just that there are a wide range of usage\npatterns and preferences on these issues. As @minrk has said about the\nnotebook design \"we have to be as unopinionated as possible\" with our\ndefault design.\n\nOn Thu, Apr 3, 2014 at 12:03 PM, Kevin Davenport\nnotifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> Yeah that is annoying.

    "body": "@ellisonbg your comment about the flashing is true in the too big \"medium\" screenshot above, but I still think there is a happy medium that is less objective and more based on tenants of human interaction design. One concern is that there are many users of IPython that are not developers like you and I who will just get by with a suboptimal experience and never know to look into modifying the .css. I mean maybe they'd get motivated enough to google it and stumble across a stackoverflow question about how customize IPython :)\n"
