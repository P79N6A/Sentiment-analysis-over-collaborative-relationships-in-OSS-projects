Keep in mind we have a function called `safe_execfile()` that we make all our `execfile` calls through.  That would be the right point to put more layers of safety in.\n\nAnd if the more manual approach you describe is truly necessary on win32, we can just do it conditionally: use the simpler method Min suggested in general, but specialize to you manual method on win32.\n\nIf that sounds reasonable, feel free to whip up a PR for it.  The window before 0.12 is closing though... I'd like to try to close as many of the open PRs as possible and start freezing for beta testing and stabilization.\n"
