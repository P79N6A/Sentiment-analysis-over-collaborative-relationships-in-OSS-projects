This will let you have in your #1 cell just the imports specific to the actual problem you're working on.\n\nYou can drop this:\n\n<pre>\nc = get_config()\nc.IPKernelApp.exec_lines = [\n\"from IPython.zmq.pylab import backend_inline\",\n\"cfg = backend_inline.InlineBackendConfig.instance()\",\n\"cfg.figure_format = 'svg'\"\n]\n</pre>\n\n\ninto a file named `ipython_notebook_config.py` in your `~/.ipython/profile_default` directory, and that will do the trick.  That, and an alias like\n\n<pre>\nalias ipnb='ipython notebook --pylab=inline'\n</pre>\n\n\nshould take care of this part of the boilerplate.\n\nNot that your suggestion isn't valid in general, just providing an immediate solution for part of it.\n"
