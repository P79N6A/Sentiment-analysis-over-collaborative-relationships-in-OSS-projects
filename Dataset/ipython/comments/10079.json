The problem is that single quotes are valid characters in the Windows console, and the normal way to escape filenames in Windows is always to use double quotes (which are *not* valid filenames).  I don't think coming up with our own escaping mechanism is really better (e.g., backslashes used to be a problem as they are separators on Windows)."
