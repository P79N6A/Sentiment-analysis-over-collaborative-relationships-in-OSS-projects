    "body": "Converting things to the new action way is on my todo list, but not for right now.  It would be cleaner if the IPython actions weren't defined in the same place as the generic action-handling code.  Then it's clearer to see what parts a 3rd party can do (i.e., declare an action, register it), and what parts are the action machinery.  In other words, it would be cleaner if you wrote the action machinery, and then pretended you were a 3rd party to actually register all of the IPython actions.\n"
