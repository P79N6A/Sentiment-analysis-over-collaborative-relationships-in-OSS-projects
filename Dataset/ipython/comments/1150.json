    "body": "@fperez, Sorry, I should have tested under Linux and Windows.  I will work on a fix.  The issue is platform specific it seems and occurs with PyQt and PySide on the mac.  I will make the check platform specific.  NativeGesture also seems relatively poorly documented so I cannot find too much information online about it.  There is apparently a build time flag -native-gestures/-no-native-guestures, which makes this that much more irritating.  I might have to check using hasattr given the lack of documentation.  I will test it this time though.  Thanks!\n"
