For that reason, we need to finish testing it in isolation until it's working reasonably well, so that when the day comes, the job is only a (likely nasty) rebase + merge.\n\nBecause if we don't work on it in parallel (even if it's unmergeable), then when we have the window with other conflicting work out of the way, we'd have to rush to do all the actual coding work quickly, and that's just not a good idea (we don't even know if there are going to be other difficulties).\n\nSo the only solution is to keep working on this until it's ready in isolation (testing it as an unmerged branch). And then, pulling a single flag day merge for it when we have a good window where the other PRs that can conflict have gone in.\n"

    "body": "I've done a forced push after resetting to @minrk's nice rebase (thanks again!).\n\nOn the `KnownFailure` I was seeing, it appears to be caused by matplotlib from master.  Back in #823 we struggled with that problem, though in that case the issue was in how mpl was packaged in Ubuntu, and the workaround was to install from source.\n\nIt appears that now the situation is the opposite: ubuntu's mpl is OK, but git master is playing this nasty nose trick somehow, breaking recognition of `KnownFailure`.\n\nBut since working with the system mpl is fine, I'll ignore the issue for us, and will follow up with matplotlib.\n\nOnce I revert back to the system mpl, everything looks good on my system;\n\n```\n**********************************************************************\nTest suite completed for system with the following information:\n{'commit_hash': 'e24836f',\n 'commit_source': 'repository',\n 'default_encoding': 'UTF-8',\n 'ipython_path': '/home/fperez/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/IPython',\n 'ipython_version': '1.0.dev',\n 'os_name': 'posix',\n 'platform': 'Linux-3.8.0-23-generic-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-13.04-raring',\n 'sys_executable': '/usr/bin/python',\n 'sys_platform': 'linux2',\n 'sys_version': '2.7.4 (default, Apr 19 2013, 18:28:01) \\n[GCC 4.7.3]'}\n\nTools and libraries available at test time:\n   curses cython jinja2 matplotlib numpy oct2py pexpect pygments pymongo qt rpy2 sqlite3 tornado wx wx.aui zmq\n\nTools and libraries NOT available at test time:\n   azure\n\nRan 12 test groups in 85.602s\n\nStatus:\nOK\n```\n\nThe Travis build is failing b/c it gets confused with the changes to submodles, so I suggest we ignore travis on this one and do the testing ourselves.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, this is ready to review/merge. I can do the merge today, but after today I'll have near-zero bandwidth until Friday, and then it's not clear how much I'll have.  So if you folks can do a bit of testing today, that would be awesome.  That way we get this flushed and don't block any other work.\n"
