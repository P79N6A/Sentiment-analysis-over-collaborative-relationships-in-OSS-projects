This is from the multiprocessing docs:\r\n\r\n> Functionality within this package requires that the `__main__` module be importable by the children. This is covered in Programming guidelines however it is worth pointing out here. This means that some examples, such as the `multiprocessing.pool.Pool` examples will not work in the interactive interpreter.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#using-a-pool-of-workers"
