    "body": "> $APPDIR/lib64/python2.6/site-packages/IPython/frontend.py:30: UserWarning: The top-level `frontend` package has been deprecated.\n\nThis suggests there's some clash and leftovers from an older IPython are still around. IPython itself no longer references the frontend.py package. Can you make sure that the IPython directory destination is clean before installing into it, so there are no stale .py and .pyc files there.\n\n When you install 1.2, can you verify that the terminal version works (just `ipython`). If it does, then see if `ipython console` works - this will test the two-process kernel and frontend decoupling, without bringing the webserver complexities into the mix.  This will help us diagnose where the problem is, and please include the output of `import IPython; print IPython.sys_info();`\n"
