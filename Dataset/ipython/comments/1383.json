    "body": "@minrk: I just pushed a commit that implemented everything using the proper controller and engine set launchers.  Everything seems to work, but this will need some careful eyes on everything.  Some particulars:\n- I read the standard cluster config files to build the same config object that ipcluster would get.  We need to test with various settings to make sure that everything propagates to the launchers properly.\n- If you have some dedicated cluster profiles that use non-Local launchers it would be great if you could test those cases.\n- The default n is now taken from the config file or num_cpus() - it can be left empty in the UI.  The proper number is returned to the UI upon starting.\n- For each cluster I keep a dict that stores the launchers.  In my on_stop handlers I delete all references to the launchers.  This happens _right_ after the stop method of the launchers is called.  Do you think I need to wait a little bit to let the launchers finish up before del'ing them?\n- Do you think I should clean up the log files on exit or cluster start or just leave them alone?\n- What to do about pid files.  I don't create/delete them.  Do you think we need to generalize the logic from ipclusterapp and manage pid files for this case?\n- Should we use a clusterid of something like \"notebook_server\" so that ipcluster could still start other cluster instances at the command line?\n\nI think we are getting close to merging though.\n\nThanks!\n"

Currently, PID files are the only thing we have in this regard, and they track IPCluster, _not_ ipcontroller.

    "body": "> What specifically was not working in the config loading.  I agree your approach is better but I thought I had been careful to get everything right.\n\nSubclasses.  For instance, I happened to have `IPClusterStart.engine_launcher_class = \"MPI\"`, because the typical way I do config is open the file, search for the first occurrence of the trait, and make the edit.  And Start happened to come before Engines.  If you want to emulate real loading, you have to check every descendent with the trait, not just the one that defines it.\n\n> Should I just load the default n into the UI?  I can try a slider, but what range of engine numbers would you use?\n\nI'm not sure.  That would require loading config from every single profile on first load (and wouldn't reflect changes to config files after server start, which I was doing).  I think the default should just be 'default' or 0.  I've seen several UIs that are sliders, with an option to double-click to enter manually.  In which case, I would only let the slider go to 16, or possibly 32, depending on how it feels.  I'm not certain this will be better than a textarea.  Maybe the real answer is just to style the textarea less starkly, so it doesn't stand out so much.  It also probably shouldn't be much more than 3 characters wide.\n"
