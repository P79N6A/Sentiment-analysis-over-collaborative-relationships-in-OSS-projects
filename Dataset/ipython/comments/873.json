    "body": "@jjehannet, I've played with the code and it's indeed a great start, but as @minrk pointed out, we'll need to back off from rendering reST for now, because it's simply too easy to trigger a docutils error.  For example, right now if you have one cell with:\n\n```\n.. _example:\n\nAn example\n========\n\nblah...\n```\n\nand another with:\n\n```\nas we see in the example_ above, blah...\n```\n\nthe second one produces a \"Docutils System Messages\" result with an \"unknown target name\" for the \"example\" target.\n\nSo I think that in the long run, we'll probably want a solution that does:\n- per-cell rendering with manually controlled docutils errors, so that unresolved references are just left alone.  This would render basic things, in-cell references and simple markup, but leave the rest as-is.\n- have a button/option that forces a render of the whole document and updates all the cells.  This may not be completely trivial to write, as the default html writer in docutils just returns a whole blob, and we'll need a way to get per-cell output to put it back in place.\n- export to reST on-disk for production of full-quality sphinx-based html and pdf.\n\nNow, it seems there's already useful code in this PR, so we could start merging things piece by piece, as the full effort will be a big job that will take some time.  But in its current form we can't merge it quite yet.  I see when I run the notebook it's dumping the html out to the terminal, but I don't know where that's coming from, since your code doesn't have printing.  Perhaps those were in the old reST code that @ellisonbg was prototyping?  In any case, they should be silenced and turned into logging calls at best, so they aren't seen in normal usage.\n\nSo question to everyone participating: what do we do with this specific PR?  Do we try to polish it and merge it in as a first step on the road towards reST support, or do you think we need to start over with a different approach?  I just want to reach a conclusion with this one before it starts having merge conflicts...\n"
