    "body": "The docstring for `operator.add()` is `add(a, b) -- Same as a + b.` so no help there. :-)\n\nHowever, `help('+')` does show something useful from the docs using the `pydoc` module. I would also recommend getting the keyword documentation from the `pydoc` module instead of rewriting some here. You will have to go source-diving to see how it gets its data from the `pydoc_data` module. Unfortunately, it's not very well factored for integration into other tools, but it's not too bad to work with.\n"

    "body": "Agreed: the doc of operator.add deserves some improvement!\n\nAh ah, thanks to the pointer to pydoc. Yes, that's (essentially) what we need!. With the latest commit `for?` recovers the documentation from the ref manual with pydoc. As you say, pydoc is not very well factored, so I had to hack my way around and duplicate a bit of code from pydoc; yuck.\nThe next steps would be:\n- Handle properly the case where there is no documentation available through pydoc\n- Explore if we could recover the documentation of `for` and friends from the tutorial rather than from the reference manual. Or at the very least provide a link to the tutorial. For complete beginners, the BNF is too dry; there should at the very least be a couple examples.\n\nI have alas exhausted the time I can devote to this. So please someone take over!!!\n"
