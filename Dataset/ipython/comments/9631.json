    "body": "> Well, as I said, I didn't see any warnings. I'm all for deprecating and removing things, but you have to make your deprecations actually seen.\n\nWe did that, it had the opposite effect, as:\n- If your isympy users update IPython, they get warnings until you release a new version\n- which can take a long time.\n- Thus depends project/users would add a \"ignore all warnings\" not to get complaints:\n- leading to actually nothing being ever shown.\n\nWe go a long way to enable any DeprecationWarning in IPython repl **by default** but only when emitted from user code. \n\nPlus you seem you seem to have a few filterwarnings, why not the following:\n\n``` python\nimport warnings\nfrom sympy import __version__\nif 'dev' in __version__:\n    action ='default'\n    travis = (os.environ.get('TRAVIS','') == 'true')\n    if travis:\n        action = 'error'\n    warnings.filterwarnings(action, message='.*', category=DeprecationWarning, module='sympy.*')\n    if [int(n) for n in __version__.split('.')[0:2]] < (2,0):\n        # muffle  inspect.getargspec() deprecated for now, might want to have a look later.\n        warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=DeprecationWarning, module='.*',\n                        message='.*inspect.getargspec.*')\n```\n\nSuch that : \n  1) Only devs see these warnigns, \n  2) You only see the warnigns that are relevant to sympy ?\n\nPlus you would catch deprecation warning from other things than IPython.\n"

I **think** this is a good compromise, let's see if it show more deprecation in the test-suite. \n\nIf that would really help you we **could** make a subclass of `DeprecationWarning` in IPython but we would likely not enable it by default. \n"
