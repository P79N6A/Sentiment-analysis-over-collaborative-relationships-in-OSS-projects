Yes I had been testing this against 5.1.0 from Debian, and didn't notice the import had been removed from git master.\r\n\r\nI'll let the Sage developers know about rlipython. It would be good to have this patch in IPython as well though, so that multiline input works even if not using rlipython. And it's easier for me to backport stuff to Debian after it's been accepted upstream, rather than waiting for Sage to add a new feature.\r\n"
