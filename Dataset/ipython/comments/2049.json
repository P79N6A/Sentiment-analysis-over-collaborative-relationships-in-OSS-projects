    "body": "^C should not terminate the process, because ^C must be interpreted as a regular sigint and raise KeyboardInterrupt in user code.  We don't want ^C to kill the kernel, because then if a user tries to interrupt their own code, the kernel will die.  We used to allow ^C to kill the kernel while user code was not running, but this still allowed accidental kernel shutdown if you tried to interrupt your own code, but ended up sending the signal after your code finished.  The only sensible answer is for kernels to not be killed by ^C.\n\nWe could, however, change the `ipython kernel` entry point to, instead of launching the kernel directly, start a minimal KernelManager, which in turn starts the actual Kernel.  If we did this, then you could interrupt the KernelManager directly with ^C, which would in turn cleanup the kernel.\n"
