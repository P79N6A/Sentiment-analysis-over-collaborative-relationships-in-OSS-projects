Overly long label lists do create clutter, though, so I guess it's a matter of balance: having the label makes it easy to find that info at any time right here, otherwise we have to go dig into the release notes.

I could argue myself both ways on this one :)  I'm still leaning towards helping daily usage by removing clutter, but the destruction of useful data worries me.

Given my recent screwup deleting the old nbconvert repo, that topic is a bit of a sore spot.\n\nThat's why I opened the issue.\n\nThe backport one is relatively easy, we can create milestones a-posteriori, and actually some of these already have a milestone.\n\nThey also get crosslink by the backport message. EG:\n\n```\nminrk added a commit that referenced this pull request on Apr 8, 2014\n @minrk Backport PR #5459: Fix interact animation page jump FF  â€¦\n```\n"
