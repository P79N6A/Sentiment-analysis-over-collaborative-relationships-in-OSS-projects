    "body": "I can't immediately replicate this, but I'd guess that for some reason it was trying to compile the expression - maybe for introspection or completion. Compiling code is usually fast, but there's a corner case with expressions involving only constants and operators which evaluate to very large numbers: Python implements a 'constant folding' optimisation, which means that these expressions are calculated at compile time rather than at run time.\r\n\r\nYou can see this using the `dis` module to examine the bytecode:\r\n\r\n```\r\n 6│ dis.dis(compile('2 ** 8', '<string>', 'eval'))\r\n  1           0 LOAD_CONST               2 (256)\r\n              2 RETURN_VALUE\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause this is being calculated in C, you can't easily interrupt Python while it's happening."
