    "body": "Thanks, there are a few problems when matplotlib is imported:\n- QT_API is ignored, even if set (ETS will be unhappy)\n- PyQt4 is the default, even if PySide is the only Qt available\n\nIt also doesn't address the larger issue of working with other (non-matplotlib) code.  As I understand it, the current model plays fine with matplotlib itself in both current master and release, so it's the _absence_ of matplotlib that seems the bigger issue to address.\n\nOur internal qt import does:\n\n``` python\nif QT_API unset:\n    try:\n        use_pyside\n    except:\n        use_pyqt_with_v2\nelif QT_API='pyside':\n    use_pyside\nelif QT_API='pyqt':\n    use_pyqt_with_v2\n```\n\nIt seems like for the kernel-side all we want to do is change the behavior if QT_API is unset, and do:\n\n``` python\nif QT_API unset:\n    try:\n        use_pyqt_with_v1\n    except:\n        use_pyside\n```\n\nSince if QT_API is set, that means the user probably does use ETS (that's where we got the variable from, I believe), and will require the v2 API, but users with no configuration will get v1 PyQt4 for maximum compatibility with legacy apps. It does mean that users of ETS with PyQt _must_ specify QT_API=pyqt, or ETS will be broken in IPython, but all 3 situations should be configurable no matter what installation combination you have.\n\nIt does demote the preferable (to us) PySide in the presence of PyQt, but that seems the safer choice at this point.\n\nI think it's fine to ask matplotlib about the qtapi, but the fallback should be on the above pattern, not straight to pyqt4 with the v1 api.\n"

    "body": "Hi, \n\nI tried to install the latest version of matplotlib, from github, in order to use pyside instead of pyqt4 (because the latter is slightly too complicated to install for \"commoners\"). However, it would seem that it still does not work, since by default, my rcParams['backend.qt4'] still is PyQt4... How is rcParams filled in? \nI wanted to try on my mac, on which I installed already PyQt4, but renamed it so as to try to only use PySide. Could that explain why python still believes PyQt4 is my backend for Qt4? \n\nedit: sorry, I guess that post should actually appear in the matplotlib github PR board. Anyway, I leave it, the issue seems to be the same for ipython...\n"
