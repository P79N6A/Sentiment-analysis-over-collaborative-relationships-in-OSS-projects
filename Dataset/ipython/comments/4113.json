    "body": "Ok, I finally tried the \"solution\" described in [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18823779/ipython-notebook-and-mathjax-labeled-equations) where you modify mathjaxutils.js. As long as you refresh the ipython notebook webpage after making changes to markdown cells that contain latex, equation numbers show up and do so in the proper order. Refreshing the page also fixes labels, which become unresolved when the cell in which they are defined is re-run (i.e., shift-enter). However, when the notebook is rendered in nbviewer.ipython.org the equation numbers are completely missing, and labels are unresolved so they are replaced with \"???\" where they are referenced in markdown text cells. The bottom line is that this is not much of a solution for most use cases, although I'm glad the original poster asked the question and figured out this much.\n"
