So I had to put logic in the constructor to check if it was being called with parameters or not (not being the case where it was being inherited).  \n\nI'm :+1: for these changes, but still think it may be a good idea to make the IPython Javascript object model more like the one backbone uses - it's a lot more friendly to the average python programmer (and has a notion of `super`).  Of course this would be a large effort.\n"
