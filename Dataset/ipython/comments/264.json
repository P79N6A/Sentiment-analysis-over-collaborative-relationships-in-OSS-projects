    "body": "Thanks Omar, this is looking much better.  Can you make the other fix that Robert suggested?  It' just a matter of moving the _logger from being a class attribute to a simple module-level global.  Since logging is used by all objects in the module, there's no benefit in making it a private attribute of each object, it can just be a module-level global (and it can be named simply 'logger', without the underscore).\n\nWe're getting close to ready for merging, thanks for the good work!\n"

Note, Omar, that the actual merge (9d65bd5f460c5b17750445d507cba2aa3d1a756d) had to resolve a few conflicts because of changes in the session api since you started working on this. But I figured we'd made you work enough on this one already, so I finished that work :)\n\nSo go ahead and continue using master, which has the final form of the merge with your earlier commits and the last one fixed up by me to resolve the conflicts.\n"
