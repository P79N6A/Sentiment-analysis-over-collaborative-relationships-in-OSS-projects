I just though I could scare off people just by saying it's an experimental feature. :)\n\nThere is already a PR implementing multiple worksheet (#2206), so I guess the feature you describe won't be in IPython.\n\nTo rescue the data in multiple worksheet, you can just select all cells, cut them, then paste to a new notebook.\n"

    "body": "We will support multiple worksheet, this is the reason the `.ipynb` format have them in the first place. \nThe only problem with current js it can't handle multiple worksheet. The `propagate the rest` not much more easier to do than supporting worksheet at all. See #2206.\n\nAlso we are working on a notebook format validator that will tell wether or not an `.ipynb` is valid, and where additional data/properties are allowed, so where implementation are required to keep additional data they don't know how to handle. (right now, these are only the metadata fields). You can discuss it in #2396.\n"
