    "body": "Hmmm...maybe. The question is how much of the old syntax we'd want to\nallow. The simple version would only work for a single argument. Multiple\narguments is an obvious extension, but I think it would take several lines\nmore code. Then there's the magic trailing comma to suppress newline, and\nthe ugly 'print >>target, object' syntax. Plus, of course, it mustn't\ninterfere with the real print() function.\n\nWe might also prefer not to have it on by default, for the same reason that\nwe turned autocall off: to avoid confusing people about how Python syntax\nworks. Making print() a normal function means one less piece of syntax to\nlearn.\n\nI think I'd suggest what we've said about quite a few feature ideas\nrecently: make a decent implementation, let people know about it, and see\nhow much popularity it gets.\n\nOn 26 February 2013 00:56, Aaron Meurer notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> OK.
