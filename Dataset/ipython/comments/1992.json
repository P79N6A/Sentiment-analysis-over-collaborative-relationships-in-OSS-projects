Honestly, files with multiple consecutive spaces are in practice _really rare_, so I don't think this warrants adding complexity to our code.\n\nThere's no point in keeping issues open forever which we're pretty sure we're not going to implement, so I'm closing this for now. Github allows further discussion on a closed issue, so we can discuss further and reopen if we come to a different conclusion.\n"
