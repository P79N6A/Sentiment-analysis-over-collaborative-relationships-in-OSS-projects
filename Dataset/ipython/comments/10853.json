    "body": "Ugh, I can see this being a classic 'every fix breaks something else' situation. Are you running screen/tmux inside IPython, or IPython inside screen/tmux? Or some other combination?\r\n\r\nNormally the terminal converts Ctrl-\\ to a signal (SIGQUIT, I think) which is sent to the current foreground process in the terminal. However, applications running in the terminal can turn off that conversion so they get the raw byte `1C` instead. We made that behave like SIGQUIT. I'm not sure how it interacts with other processes also capturing terminal interaction.\r\n\r\nThere isn't an easy way to configure it at the moment, but we could probably add something if we can't think of anything smarter to do about it.\r\n\r\ncc @jonathanslenders for info"

    "body": "To clarify the screen/tmux point: I run into this issue when IPython is run outside tmux, because the Ctrl-\\ binding is in my muscle memory. As a result, sometimes I hit the keycombo forgetting that I'm outside tmux, and poof, there goes the IPython session.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, it would be very useful to have an option to disable this binding.  This has come up as an issue in the past for readline (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21255480/preventing-sigquit-from-terminating-interactive-python/21255589), but the proposed solutions no longer work."
