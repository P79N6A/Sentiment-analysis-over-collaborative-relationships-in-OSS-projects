The related issue is #1858.\n\nThere are several problems:\n1. When substantial output is removed, what do you expect the position on the page to be?\n2. When executing a cell, a new cell is focused.  The browser will attempt to put the corresponding `<textarea>` visible on the screen (CodeMirror hides this element).\n3. CodeMirror will attempt to put the next input cell on the screen also.\n4. jQuery may used to put the next selected cell on the screen.\n5. IPython waits 500ms, then removes the output of the current cell (in case your command is nearly instantaneous -- it will replace the output in a way that is intended to prevent scrolling).\n\nNumbers 2-5 can be handled, though there is a lot of annoying overlapping functionality.  #1 is a bit harder.  If you remove half the output on an arbitrary webpage, there's no good way for the browser to know what you desire to remain on the screen.  The approach I'm taking to this is to attempt to keep the selected input cell at a fixed location on the screen (which is NOT a fixed location within the height of the document -- hence the problem).  This requires us to scroll differently, depending on whether output is removed above or below the selected cell.  Consider executing a long-running cell, and scrolling to an arbitrary position in the document before the output is received.  What do you expect to happen?  To do this I have to calculate the scrollHeight of the selected cell, remove or add output, and scroll to put the selected cell back in the same place.  I'm not convinced this can be done without visible flickering as the page scrolls then scrolls back.  But I have prototype code that does this.\n\nI'll also post a worksheet explaining the old behavior and (what I consider to be) desired behavior for several focus-related issues.\n\nThere's also new auto-scrolling long output cells that I need to pull and look at.\n"

Selfishly, I really don't care because this has no effect on my experience, but I know there are plenty of FF-on-Linux users ( for some reason :) ).  Unless I hear otherwise (pinging @ellisonbg, @Carreau, @takluyver, @ivanov), I will go with @fperez's comments above as our most invested FF-on-Linux user, and leave this without change.\n"

Browser-forced scrolling occurs in two instances:\n1) elements are added to or removed from the DOM.\n2) input form elements (CodeMirror's <textarea>) are focused while off-screen.\n\n#1 can be dealt with by being more explicit about how we add/remove things.  I'm\nexperimenting with (a) animating the removal of elements in\nOutputArea.prototype.clear_output_callback (b) animating adding of output and\n(c) using replace() rather than append() or if that doesn't work, making the\noutput div have 'display: none', add everything, and then make it visible.\n(work-in-progress) The problems I still have is that the height of elements\nisn't always known when added, and if it's not known it can't be animated, and\nthat there are still element movements that I don't understand how they're\ngetting moved.  This 'animation' is on the height of the output div, so it\nappears to close and open and you can see what is moving where, holding the\nfocused input cell at a fixed location.  I really don't like having half the\nscreen jump on an update, then I have to go hunting for what happened to my\ncursor.\n\n#2 can be dealt with by making sure that a focused cell is already on the screen\nwhen we call CodeMirror's focus().  (I've already separated the 'select' and\n'focus' mechanisms into two distinct calls)  This is the easier of the two\ncases and is essentially done.\n\nI'm going to revert and re-write most of my changes in #1 because I made a mess,\nbut I'll try to push what I've done on #2 tonight.\n\n## \n\nCheers, Bob McElrath\n\n\"The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by\nthe tribe.
