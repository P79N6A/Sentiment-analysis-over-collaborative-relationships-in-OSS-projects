    "body": "Two issues:\n\n1) The different icons don't have the same size. I tried it out and unless the icons have exactly the same size and have completely overlapping shapes, it looks horrible and jumpy for the transition. The hollow and solid circle is probably one of the few pairs that look good.\n\n2) More importantly, putting something like an empty checkbox next to the circle kernel indicator leads to this horribly confusing situation where you have a featureless square next to a featureless circle. Users will have no idea what these are - even after they see how it works. I played around with it like this for a while and _I_ couldn't understand the different transitions. More like random blinking shapes..\n"
