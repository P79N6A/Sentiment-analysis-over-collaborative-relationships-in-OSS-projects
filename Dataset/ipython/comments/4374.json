    "body": "Continuing a discussion from HipChat,\n\n@cekees This PR provides an MVC-like architecture on top of the comm stuff.  It's useful for widgets that can be expressed via a list of properties.  This PR synchronizes a python traitlet model in the backend with a backbone model in the front.  Some of the things it automatically handles are \n- delta compression (only sending the state information that has changed)\n- wiring the message callbacks to the correct cells automatically\n- inter-view synchronization (handled by backbone)\n- message throttling (to avoid flooding the kernel)\n- parent/child relationships between views (which one can override to specify custom parent/child relationships)\n- ability to manipulate the widget view's DOM from python using CSS, $().addClass, and $().removeClass methods\n\n~~That being said, if you're interested in lower level control (for example, implementing a renderer that streams images to the browser using webm compression or something similar), you'll want to use comms to implement your widgets.~~\n\n**EDIT 11/20/2013:** Support for custom messages was added a couple of days ago.\n"

If you are planning on using it within a modified IPython environment where only one cell exists, that should work great (as long as the comm stuff is available).  If you are planning on using it elsewhere, the coupling with IPython isn't horrible, but it will require a little bit of work.  As of now it depends on\n- IPython traitlets\n- IPython Comm & CommManager\n- IPython.OutputArea (required to map outputs with a comm message)\n- JQuery, Require.js, bootstrap, underscore.js, and backbone.js\n\n**EDIT 11/4/13: Updated with new details**\n"

Encapsulating all the IPython notebook-specific things, like what the output DOM looks like, into a function or two that I could override is what I was hoping for.\n\nIf I understand things correctly, there is only one widget area per cell?  That seems kind of limiting.  I'd love to print some text, have a widget, print some more text, have another widget, etc.  Is there any way to embed widgets in the normal output flow?  I mean, I can embed images, audio, and all sorts of other things in the normal output region of a cell, inline with the other output---why not widgets too?\n"

This is one of the design questions that we talked about in one of the first dev meetings regarding this subject.  @ellisonbg and I re-discussed the issue when I started implementing this.  \n\nThe problem is that we don't want the widgets to be cleared along with the output.  In other words, we want the user to be able to make a widget and hookup the value change event to a function that clears the output and plots.  If the output clear event cleared the entire output with the widgets included, the widget on the front end and corresponding com would get closed.  Then the user would have to re-show the widget with the output.  Even if the clear output selectively cleared the output, the placement of the widgets would be ruined.\n"

The existing framework can behave like that already.  There is already a LabelView (which lets you display arbitrary HTML in the widget area).  The only thing that is missing is an ImageWidget or PlotWidget.

Suppose I want to execute a user function every time a button is clicked, and put whatever output the user did in that function in a box below the button (this is similar to how Sage interacts work right now).\n\nMaybe, I _think_ redirecting output from the standard output area to a widget is not possible with the current callback system.  I believe that would require the msg callbacks stored in the front-end (that direct output to the correct cell) to be modified in the middle of a cell execution in the back-end.  I don't think there is a message that allows this to be done.  @minrk would definitely know how to do this and if it could be done.\n\n> In the use-case you mentioned above, to me it seems more elegant to make the plot that would be cleared a specific region in the output\n\nIt may be more elegant, but I don't think it would be the simplest solution.   Right now a user can create a widget and register a callback for it's value change.  In that callback the user clears the output and draws a plot, just like he/she normally would for simple animations.  The benefit is that the output area is predictable and behaves like it does without widgets.\n\nAlso, just to make sure we are on the same page, these widgets are not a form of interact.  Interact can and will be built on top of these widgets, which is what @ellisonbg has shown and is still working on. \n"
