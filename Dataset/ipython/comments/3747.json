I personally think this would be great addition (perfect example is the cherry picker plugin I wrote).  Maybe an alias like `--to notebook`.  To do so a matching entry would need to be added to exporter.py in the exporter_map.  \n- Also, it would be nice if the FilesWriter knew how to write a notebook node object if it recieved it as input.  If not maybe a NotebookFilesWriter that inherits from FilesWriter.  I prefer the FilesWriter knowing how to write a notebook node object (see small diagram below).\n\n> I'm wondering if we shouldn't have a dummy IPynb2IPynbExporter class that inherit from BaseExporter just in case we want custom logic later.\n\nI think I would wait to do that.  Most of the logic used in the baseexporter applies to any type of conversion.  Since we still need to write some importing stuff, maybe we could do something like this:\n\n(sorry this is so crappy, I drew it in MS Paint)\n![diagram](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3292874/941993/6b80478a-0166-11e3-9447-1611a4dba545.jpg)\n"

    "body": "> Right now one can't use the baseexporter from the CLI Do we want to add this functionality now? I personally think this would be great addition (perfect example is the cherry picker plugin I wrote). Maybe an alias like --to notebook. To do so a matching entry would need to be added to exporter.py in the exporter_map.\n\nI think we have 5 month, we better have to wait for BaseExporter to be done before jumping into writing something we will have to do from scratch.\n\n> Also, it would be nice if the FilesWriter knew how to write a notebook node object if it recieved it as input. If not maybe a NotebookFilesWriter that inherits from FilesWriter. I prefer the FilesWriter knowing how to write a notebook node object (see small diagram below).\n\nRead and write of `.ipynb` should use nbformat, which already know how to write `.ipynb`. I also want NbValidator to be used along the way.\n\n> I think I would wait to do that. Most of the logic used in the baseexporter applies to any type of conversion. Since we still need to write some importing stuff, maybe we could do something like this:\n\nNot completely sure about that, I don't quite see what rst2ipynb will reuse in base exporter..\n\n> naming question: should the base be Exporter and the current Exporter be TemplateExporter? Seems more precisely descriptive to me.\n\nAsk @ellisonbg he asked @jdfreder to [remove the Template suffix](https://github.com/ipython/nbconvert/pull/137/files#L5L109).\n"

Something like this maybe:\n\n``` python\n    from IPython.nbformat import current as nbformat\n```\n\nAnd in the write method:\n\n``` python\n            # Write conversion results.\n            if isinstance(output, NotebookNode):\n                self.log.info(\"Writing notebook to %s\", dest)\n                with io.open(dest, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n                    nbformat.write(output, fp=f, format='ipynb')\n            else:\n                self.log.info(\"Writing %i bytes to %s\", len(output), dest)\n                with io.open(dest, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n                    f.write(output)\n            return dest\n```\n\n> writing something we will have to do from scratch.\n\nI'm confused, I was just suggesting adding an entry to export.py, not doing the all the import stuff now, putting that off for later work.\n\n> I don't quite see what rst2ipynb will reuse in base exporter..\n\nI think  just `from_file` and `from_filename` method signatures (not the code inside the methods).\n"
