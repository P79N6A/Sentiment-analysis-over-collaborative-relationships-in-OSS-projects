    "body": "**Why anchor temporary variable**\n\nThe reason for storing the result of \"anchor = self._control.anchorAt(event.pos())\" as a temporary variable instead of directly into self._anchor is I wanted to check to see if the pointer was still over the same anchor (line 443). \n\nI'd seen some applications where the tooltip keeps getting redrawn in slightly different locations as the pointer moves and it's quite annoying. This way the tooltip gets drawn once until the anchorAt is empty or is over a different anchor.\n\nI was assuming it's possible for two anchors to be next to each other without receiving a mouse move message that would clear self._anchor.\n\n**Performance of calling self._control.anchorAt**\n\nAs for performance. I'm basically depending on Qt to batch the mouse move messages to keep the lookup call count low.\n\nThe other solution I'd thought of was to have receiving a mouse move reset and then start a short timer, and only do the self._control.anchorAt call once the pointer hadn't moved for 200ms. \n\nThen I decided I wasn't sure where to put the timer class and went for the simpler to read solution.\n\nI'm not sure of a good way to test which is lighter-weight between the timer and just calling anchorAt.\n"
