    "body": "IPython doesn't do syntax highlighting in the terminal - you need to take control of the terminal at a lower level than we do to highlight input like that. If you want that, try [bpython](http://bpython-interpreter.org/), or [bipython](http://bipython.org/) to combine that with the goodness of IPython.\n\nThere isn't a `%color_info` magic - for some reason, our help output says that there is. We'll remove it from the help.\n"
