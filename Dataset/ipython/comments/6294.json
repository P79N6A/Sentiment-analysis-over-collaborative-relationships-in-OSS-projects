    "body": "Today I tested the `ipython nbconvert --to pdf *.ipynb` in my opensuse 13.1 system, after installed texlive and some other texlive-\\* thing, it worked fine without this fix.\n\nSo is this maybe a windows issue? Or has it something to do with the tex(or pdflatex) version or environment I've installed in my windows system.\n\nCan anyone point out how to figure this out? Thanks.\n\nAnyway, at least this works for me. So I'll wait a little while to see if anyone have come up with the same issue or if someone has know what's really going on, then I'll close this, and leave it for anyone to search.\n"
