We put the button in the \"Notebook\" section of the left panel (see panelsection for that code).\n2. We put the button in a span right after the save widget span and keep it up top.\n\nI have been trying to keep the header area clear of most things so my initial though is to do 1, but I am open to 2.  What do others think?\n\nAlso, this capability should be called \"Print\" as we plan on having \"Publish\" be something that is richer (with a static URL) and includes a notion of sharing.  This is more of a lightweight on the fly printing capability. \n"

But he's actually also started to play with gist upload functionality, so you're right that we should keep the 'publish' name for something else.  \n\nHowever, I don't think that 'print' is the right name, because what this gives is a static html version, that can both be saved to disk or printed.  So I wonder if 'View HTML' wouldn't be a better name... Thoughts?\n"

But I don't want ours to pop up a print dialog automatically, as in many cases you may want this for reasons other than actual printing.  So I think we should state what the button does: it gives a static view of the notebook...\n\nObviously the downside is that people looking to print may do the wrong thing and try to print the active version...\n\nHow about calling it 'Print/HTML'?  And _not_ popping the print dialog automatically.  Then it's clear that's the way to print, but also to get a static html view...\n"
