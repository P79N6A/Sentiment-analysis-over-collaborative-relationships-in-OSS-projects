But before we jump into\nthis, I think we should step back and ask some questions:\n- Do we want to go in this direction - it adds a lot of power, but also a\n  lot of hidden/modal state.\n- There are a number of ways of implementing a multikey command mode. We\n  should do a quick survey of the different approaches. Another option is to\n  have more of a full blown mini command line where you can type commands\n  such as \"dd 0-10\"\n- I feel like our existing keyboard shortcuts are less than optimal. I am\n  all for improving them, but I want to make sure that any changes we make\n  are aboslutely a clear improvement.\n\nWhat do other people think about this? @fperez @jdfreder @minrk @takluyver\n@jasongrout\n\nOn Sat, Oct 11, 2014 at 10:41 AM, Matthias Bussonnier <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> by multimeter shortcuts\n> \n> Did I miss type ?
