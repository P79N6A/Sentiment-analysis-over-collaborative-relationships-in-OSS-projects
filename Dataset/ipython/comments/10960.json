At this point (completing `a.<tab>`), one system gives `a.foo`, and the other just gives `foo`, so they're not duplicates. When they're rectified, `foo` becomes `a.foo`, but the deduplication has already happened.\r\n\r\nPresumably we want to rearrange things so they are rectified and then deduplicated. Have you got time to work on this? You're more familiar with that bit of the code than I am."

I hadn't  had a chance to send a patch.\r\n\r\nThere is a `_deduplicate_completions` already available  in `IPython.core.completer` and used only by prompt_toolkit.\r\n\r\nIt's probably just a matter of plugging it in the right place in ipykernel.\r\n\r\nA more permanent fix would be to use the new completion API and give feedback on it with notebooks fromtend.\r\n"
