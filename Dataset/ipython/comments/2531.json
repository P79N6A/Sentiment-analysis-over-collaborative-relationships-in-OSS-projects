    "body": "using [EXE Explorer](http://www.mitec.cz/exe.html), I can confirm that the py2-win32 installer gives 32b executables and the py3-64 installer gives 32b executables.  I'm not sure the py3-64 case is a problem, since the 32b executable actually works fine.  The 64b py2-32 executable will work fine _on 64b Windows_, but not an actual 32b Windows system (why does such a thing still exist?!).\n\nThe explanation being [here](http://docs.python.org/2/distutils/builtdist.html#cross-compiling-on-windows), that Windows Python cannot cross-compile (though it will not raise any errors, it will just do it wrong), and my default python2 is 64b and my default python3 is 32b.  The answer is to generate each installer with the target Python.\n\nI have updated release_windows.py to do this, and I believe that I now have the right installers.\n\nRegenerated installers currently at [archive.ipython.org](http://archive.ipython.org/testing/0.13.1/) if anyone wants to test/confirm.\n\nShould I upload them, and just clobber the bad installers (py2-32 and/or py3-64)?\n"
