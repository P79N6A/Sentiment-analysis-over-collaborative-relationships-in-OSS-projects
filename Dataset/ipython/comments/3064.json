If you put `%20` in place of spaces for the actual page URL (normally browsers do this substitution behind the scenes), it should work.\n"

    "body": "Hi, thanks for this feature, but here's a use case that isn't currently supported. If I have headers like this:\n- Setup 1\n  - Unnormalized\n  - Normalized\n- Setup 2\n  - Unnormalized\n  - Normalized\n\ni.e. some headers are duplicated under different parents, the anchors of all \"copies\" point to the first one. Do you think this use case is worth supporting or should I just work around it? I think it would be convenient to have such a feature. It could be implemented by prefixing anchors with all higher level headers' anchors.\n"
