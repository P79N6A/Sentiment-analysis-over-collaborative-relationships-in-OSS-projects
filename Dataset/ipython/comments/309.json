It would be nice to see K reported in addition to S in the test run.  Some skips are just for optional or platform-specific stuff, which don't really need 'fixing', while the known failures are things that eventually should go to zero, though for now (as discussed before) we don't want them polluting the main test run.\n\nSo if you can figure out how to make those guys return true K in the test run, that would be awesome.  Otherwise we'll merge it as is, since it's already quite an improvement over the current state of affairs.\n\nThanks for the good work!\n"
