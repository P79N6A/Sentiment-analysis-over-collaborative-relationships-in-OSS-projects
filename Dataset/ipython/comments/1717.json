    "body": "I was just thinking that the `[]`, absent actual numbers inside, look a bit nonsensical.  hence my suggestion to go with bare `In :` and `Out:`.  Those original constants were part of a toy prototype that @ellisonbg and I wrote back in early 2010, when we built the first proof of concept of a 2-process interactive python shell using zmq.  Since we just wanted to see if it ran and the basics worked, we put a simple static prompt, but made it different from the regular python `>>>` one to remind us visually that it wasn't the normal shell.  So there's no real importance to those old prompts, and I think we should lean more towards consistency with actual ipython use.\n\nBut this is a very minor point, of course :)\n"
