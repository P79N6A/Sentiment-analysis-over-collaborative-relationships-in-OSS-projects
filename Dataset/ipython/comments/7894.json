Try moving `cache.py` (and possibly `decorators hack.py`) away, I have issues seeing how `decorators hack` could be imported as decorator. But it seem like something is imported as decorator instead of the right one. \n\nYou can try to shove a `print(decorator.__file__)` just before the line that crash to get a hint I guess. \n"
