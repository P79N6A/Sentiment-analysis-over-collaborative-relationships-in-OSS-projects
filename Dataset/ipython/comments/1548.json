    "body": "I made your edits to the notebook, and started a doc for the AsyncResult object.  I really want to make it clear that the AsyncResult object itself is where most of our API lives.  At least the nifty parts.\n\nI have one question we should resolve before merging.  In wall_time, I use received -  submitted, which is the actual roundtrip time for the Client.  The only problem with this one is that the `received` timestamp is not _especially_ reliable, particularly in interactive use cases.  The reason being that this timestamp is made when the result is pulled off of the queue in the Client, as a result of `Client.spin()`.  So if the result of the computation arrives either while the user is sitting idle at an interactive prompt or just performing some client-side computation, that time is added to the wall_time measure.\n\nThis is a larger issue for AsyncHubResults (those fetched from the Hub), where the `received` stamp could technically be days after the computation finished.\n\nPossible partial solutions to this problem:\n- HubResults should use `completed-submitted`, ignoring result-reply overhead\n- _all_ AsyncResults should use `completed-submitted` (most consistent, but probably not most useful/interesting)\n- HubResults should just not have a `wall_time` property\n- Add an analogue to `received` to the Hub's DB, and use that in HubResults\n- Leave it as-is, and let users deal with wall_time rarely being useful in HubResults (it would still be accurate if the HubResult is requested and waited upon while the computation is pending)\n\nI'm personally inclined towards either one of the last two, but I want there to be a convenient\n\nThere are a couple of other timings that might be useful to add:\n- last completed - first started (actual time spent _working_, excluding overhead - I don't know what it's name should be)\n- last completed - first submitted (wall_time excluding reply overhead, which may not be interesting or meaningful)\n- last received - first started (excludes start overhead, which could have just been waiting for other jobs in the queue)\n- idle time (total time spent on each engine _not_ during a computation) - this might be computed per-engine to draw one of those pipeline concurrency figures.\n\nI don't know how many of these I should actually include.  Perhaps I should just make a method that makes it easy to do any of the `last/first X - first/last Y` deltas.\n"
