The man page for that says:\n\n> mintty communicates with the child process through a pseudo terminal device, which Cygwin emulates using Windows pipes. This means that native Windows command line programs started in mintty see a pipe rather than a console device\n\nThat doesn't sound like it will work terribly well, and a solution that involves installing Cygwin isn't very satisfactory anyway.\n\nI'm hoping that [midipix](http://www.midipix.org/) might eventually make things better on Windows, but I don't think it's an immediate solution.\n"
