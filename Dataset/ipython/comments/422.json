    "body": "I see no problem with this other than possibly the copying of find_scripts to find_gui_scripts.  Our setup code for finding packages and scripts is ludicrously complicated at this point, resulting in the just about every new package or script not being properly installed under some circumstances for weeks or months after being added.  Maybe implement this inside one `find_scripts` method that returns:\n\n``` python\nif entry_points:\n    return {'console_scripts' : [cscripts], 'gui_scripts' : [gscripts]}}\nelse:\n    return [allscripts]\n```\n\nSo we can just do:\n\n``` python\nsetuptools_extra_args['entry_points'] = find_scripts(True)\n#...\n setup_args['scripts'] = find_scripts(False)\n```\n"
