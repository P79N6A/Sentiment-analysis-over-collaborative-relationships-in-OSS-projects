    "body": "Thank you. I also can reproduce it . Very interesting bug. \n\nFirst of all, let me simplify your example:\n\n```\nimport numpy as nps\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'svg'\n%matplotlib inline\nsize=2\n\nplt.hist(np.random.random(size), log=True) # run in one cell\n\nplt.hist(np.random.random(size), log=True) # run in another cell\n```\n\nNow delete the first one and look at the second plot. The issue should appear.\n\nThe interesting thing is that this only happens when:\n1. We are plotting in logarithmic scale (`log=True`). \n2. The plot that is deleted has the same type than the second plot. If we use `plt.bar` and `plt.hist`, the second plot is not modified after deleting the first. The second plot is also restored after printing another plot of the same type.\n3. Using Chrome. In Firefox, everything looks alright.\n\nBefore deleting the first plot:\n\n![screenshot from 2015-03-24 17 44 40](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/599274/6815926/debc64be-d251-11e4-9a8f-385459886426.png)\n\nAfter deleting the first plot:\n\n![screenshot from 2015-03-24 17 44 55](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/599274/6815933/110c0582-d252-11e4-9b06-398c3f548b19.png)\n\nAfter printing another plot of different type:\n\n![screenshot from 2015-03-24 17 45 21](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/599274/6815940/33320fc6-d252-11e4-8de6-63362e9e665f.png)\n\nAfter printing another plot of the same type (in this case, `plt.hist`):\n\n![screenshot from 2015-03-24 17 45 39](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/599274/6815954/4fe6f280-d252-11e4-99ef-05bcb8c61019.png)\n\nAfter diffing the whole HTML of the notebook before and after deleting the first plot, I wasn't able to find a significant difference. The paths are the same and axes don't seem to be modified. The positions of the paths seem to change (or the axes)  but that wasn't reflected in the diff. The only thing I noticed that might cause issues is that every svg plot has the same ids. For example:  \n\n```\n <g id=\"figure_1\">    \n        <g id=\"patch_1\">...</g>\n        <g id=\"axes_1>...</g>\n </g>\n```\n\nbut I don't think that is the problem here.\n"

    "body": "> After diffing the whole HTML of the notebook before and after deleting the first plot, I wasn't able to find a significant difference.\n\nYeah, I'd doubt that it'd be HTML; it comes and goes (and comes and goes again) depending on various actions in the notebook.\n\nI think it's really just that the data points are failing to be clipped by the axes rectangle.  But why this should fail intermittently is the question.\n\nAnother data point: I can use just plain `plot`s, with no log scaling, and get extra data to appear on all four sides of the axes:\n\n![matplotlibsvgnotebookbug2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1470769/6817728/2c9b4a78-d27b-11e4-820a-494f771aea1c.png)\n\nSo I guess it's just a generic feature of the SVG, whenever the range of the data being plotted is larger than the range of the `xlim` and `ylim` values.\n"

    "body": "Okay. I still can't decide who is at fault here. This is the evidence so far:\n\nIf you delete the node that contains the first plot (that is, delete its SVG information)  using the Developer Tools in Chrome, then you obtain the same bug.\n\nNow, after copying (twice) the SVG code to a HTML file and opening the file in Chrome, you get a huge plot (due to `width: 100%;` and `height: 100%;`). Try to delete the first plot (again with the Developer Tools) and at first nothing wrong happens, but zoom-in or zoom-out and you're going to obtain the same bug:\n\n![screenshot from 2015-03-24 21 31 09](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/599274/6817920/1e83a9b6-d26d-11e4-8ebc-c26954d245b3.png)\n\nBy the way, after that, I removed the additional properties that Ipython is including in the SVG. The reason is that Firefox wasn't rendering correctly the plots. I don't think most of them are needed anyway.\n\nFirefox (after removing additional attributes in SVG):\n![screenshot from 2015-03-24 21 33 08](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/599274/6817953/a5001aec-d26d-11e4-9e7e-c2e0a1588cf5.png)\n\nThat seems upside down. However, if I zoom in, I get this:\n\n![screenshot from 2015-03-24 21 36 27](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/599274/6817973/da4bd934-d26d-11e4-8d66-bcafec731969.png)\n\nWhen I zoom in even further the plot switches between bars starting from the top and the bottom. \n\nIn Chrome, we get more consistency (even though the plot is wrong)\n\n![screenshot from 2015-03-24 22 14 57](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/599274/6818337/4a3f4712-d273-11e4-9444-93e2b9460e30.png)\n\nI'm thinking the generated plots might not be valid SVG (or at least, they are obviously not standard). That could be the problem. Does anyone know a good SVG validator? I found a couple but the results were not satisfactory. One of them pointed out that the SVG has one error in the property xlink:href in this line: `<use style=\"stroke:#000000;stroke-width:0.5;\" x=\"30.5\" xlink:href=\"#m93b0483c22\" y=\"230.4\"></use>` but I'm not completely convinced about it.\n"

    "body": "@takluyver Very unlikely. As an example, the New York Times is full of SVGs and work very well. [caniuse](http://caniuse.com/#search=svg) shows that support among browsers is reasonable. I also tested Mike Bostock's example of a histogram (copied the d3 code twice to generate two histograms) and  the bug didn't appear, although the example is admittedly very simple. \n\nI think the main indicator that the generated SVG might be suboptimal is that Firefox and Chrome have different issues displaying it.  As I said, I had to remove many attributes in the SVG tag because Firefox didn't want to render the plots. However, the picture is complicated by the fact that Firefox rendered the plots correctly within the notebook.\n"

    "body": "Yes, Safari and Chrome are likely to share the same bug. In my opinion, the best argument in favor of a browser bug is that the second SVG code is not changing at all after deleting the first plot. On the other hand,  I tried to replicate the bug with this [histogram](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Histogram_example.svg) from Wikipedia but no luck so far.  \n\nThere might be a middle ground, though. We are generating a tricky SVG to handle. It is using a lot of paths for things that are better done using `rect` or `polygon` and adding properties that are not necessary when rendering HTML documents. Maybe that is exposing some bug in the browsers. However, it is also difficult to explain why it is exposing different bugs and at least in Firefox, overall unstable behavior. Furthermore, we are generating different SVGs (bar, hist, plot) and all of them reproduce the same issue. Assuming our SVGs are correct, that's quite a coincidence.  \n\nIt is also interesting that the example using `plot` can reproduce this issue but removing `log=True` in the other examples avoids the problem.\n"

With `log=False`, the bars of the histogram range between y=0 and y=1 (or higher), but the limits _also_ go from y=0 to y=1 (or higher), so all of the plotted stuff is within the limits, and there's nothing to be displayed incorrectly.  With `log=True`, the bars extend infinitely(ish) far down, but the ylimit has some finite minimum, so the bars can be accidentally displayed.\n\nThat's why I think `plot` is the more useful case; as long as there's data outside the limits, it looks like there's potential for that data to be accidentally displayed.\n"

    "body": "@moble Okay. I have reproduced the problem in a very simple SVG:\n\n```\n<svg width=\"120\" height=\"120\"\n     viewPort=\"0 0 120 120\" version=\"1.1\"\n     xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n\n    <defs>\n        <clipPath id=\"myClip\" >\n            <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"97\" height=\"97\" />\n        </clipPath>\n    </defs>\n    <g clip-path=\"url(#myClip)\">\n        <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" fill=\"blue\" />\n        <circle cx=\"97\" cy=\"50\" r=\"5\" fill=\"red\"/> \n    </g>\n</svg>\n\n\n<svg width=\"120\" height=\"120\"\n     viewPort=\"0 0 120 120\" version=\"1.1\"\n     xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n\n    <defs>\n        <clipPath id=\"myClip\" >\n            <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"97\" height=\"97\" />\n        </clipPath>\n    </defs>\n    <g clip-path=\"url(#myClip)\">\n        <rect x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" fill=\"blue\" />\n        <circle cx=\"97\" cy=\"50\" r=\"5\" fill=\"red\"/> \n    </g>\n</svg>\n```\n\nIn the developer tools, delete one of the figures and zoom in. The circle will be shown outside of the boundary.\n\nI can't explain exactly what is happening, but the problem is related to the clipping mask applied in  `<defs>`. When we zoom in (or zoom out), the clipping mask doesn't seem to scale correctly but this only happens after removing one of the figures. The issue here is that both figures have the same `id` property for the `clipPath` element. If you change one of them (e.g. `<clipPath id=\"myClip2\">`), then this issue should be solved (remember also change it in `<g clip-path=\"url(#myClip2)\">`).\n\nBefore:\n\n![screenshot from 2015-04-04 00 28 22](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/599274/6991707/014b40b4-da62-11e4-98c1-db6eb41f0828.png)\n\nAfter:\n\n![screenshot from 2015-04-04 00 30 38](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/599274/6991708/08c80d2c-da62-11e4-80ad-584bf38ed6c3.png)\n"

As you can see, matplotlib is only using content information in the hash. I think a solution would be to include an extra parameter with a randomly generated value to prevent the current bug. However, they could be relying on the current behavior in some tests, so it is better to open an issue and let them know what is happening.\n\n@takluyver I think you can close this issue in favor of opening another in the matplotlib repository.\n"
