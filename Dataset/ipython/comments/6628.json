    "body": "Support for lossless roundtrip to .py files is not planned for support. In the next release, the `--script` flag is to be removed. The reason the output is different is also the reason `--script` is to be removed. `--script` was added when writing notebooks as Python was part of `IPython.nbformat`, and never actually wrote correct Python files. With the addition of `nbconvert`, this is no longer the case, and support for `.py` files is to be removed from IPython.nbformat. `Download as` uses nbconvert, which is the proper Python output of a notebook.\n\nIn the absence of `--script`, I do plan to add a more generic post-save hook, which could be used here.\n"

Round-tripping is not strictly necessary, but it would be nice feature anyway (running PEP8 checkers as suggested by @raghavrv  being one use case and easy diffing/merging another),\n"
