    "body": "As a reminder to anyone else reading this, the correct way to configure an IPython instance is to create a config object first, set values on it, and pass it in when the instance is created. After instantiation, you change values directly on the app and shell objects, not in their config (but that doesn't work for config values which are only checked at startup, like in this example).\n\nBut it's still bizarre that the behaviour is affected by the existence of a config file, hence this issue.\n"

    "body": "I'm going to close this, because it's just a misuse / misunderstanding of config.\n\nThe reason creating a config file has an effect on this particular code is that loading a config file will load the config from the file file, then _reload_ prior config (which would normally come from the command-line), in order to ensure the right priority.  It's that reload for priority that makes this case 'work'.\n"
