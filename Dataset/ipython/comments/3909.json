If it doesn't, you could just symlink (or copy over) the other directory to the place where the Notebook is currently finding IPython. You could also try contacting the folks at @Enthought to see if they might have a clue as to how you got into this state and how to best get out of it. I don't know anything about Canopy and how it packages things.\n"
