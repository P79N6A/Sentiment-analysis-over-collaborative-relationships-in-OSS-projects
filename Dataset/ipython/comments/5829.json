I think (we should test this) it will force users to mouse click\nback on the notebook area to reenable command mode after using anything in\nthe toolbar. Again, I think we should only add this logic to the exact\nelements that need keyboard focus, not entire divs just because.\n\nOn Mon, May 12, 2014 at 10:53 AM, Juergen Hasch notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> My usecase is actually a small search extension for the notebook.

I think even if you are escaped from the keyboard manager, the standard tab key should cause the next element to focus on the page- enough tab presses should re-enter you into edit or command mode (if this isn't true, we probably should fix this- this is also useful for the widgets- the user should be able to tab to get back into edit/command mode).\n"

    "body": "It is true that clicking at some toolbar buttons (those not performing a cell action like save), you have to click back on the notebook area to get to command mode again. That could be fixed.\n\nThe other approach would be to register the cell type and cell toolbar dropdown menus only, so they can be used with standard keyboard controls. This might be the better solution, as it does not require every additional toolbar button to focus the notebook area again after execution.\nSo I would be fine with this:\n`IPython.keyboard_manager.register_events($('#cell_type'));\nIPython.keyboard_manager.register_events($('#ctb_select'));`\n"
