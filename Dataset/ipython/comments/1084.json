    "body": "Well, I don't think we should be going overboard, but I'd found myself already a number of times wanting precisely this very feature, and I do find it super useful: it's unobtrusive and lets you know at a quick glance, from a pile of open browser tabs, which one to return to.  It's the browser equivalent of terminal bells.\n\nGmail/gchat use this same idea to mark activity in a browser tab and I always have found it useful, despite me being fairly allergic to anything that blinks/moves in my visual field.\n\nHow else would you suggest we approach this?  Within javascript we  don't have the right to call any local (growl-like) notification mechanism, and those tend to be even more intrusive in general (with popups and stuff).  I'm happy to discuss it further, but honestly this one seems to me like a good, valid use of the titlebar as the least-intrusive solution to an actual problem.  I don't foresee anything else going into the titlebar in the long run,  though, so I don't think you need to worry about this being the first step in a problematic feature creep in that direction.\n"

So the place where you need to know whether it needs\n  saving is in the worksheet itself, we can think of a good place to\n  show this state, but the title is certainly not.\n- the icon changing: that goes a bit too far, and starts getting into\n  visual gimmick territory.\n\nSo on this particular topic, I'd say the 'busy' indicator does serve a\nvalid purpose, but I reiterate it's _not_ the 'first of many' such\nthings.  It's useful because it does show you the one thing you want\nto know about a kernel without opening its tab manually: \"is it\nfinished so I can go look at my results, or should I keep doing\nsomething else over here?\".  Because it lets you answer that question\nat a glance, without otherwise disturbing your workflow and that\ninformation _has_ value when you're in a different tab (in contrast to\nthe dirty info, for example), then I think it's a valid piece of data\nto put in the title, and probably the only piece of dynamic info that\nshould go there.\n\nNote that I'm not trying to quash your concerns, we should definitely\ndiscuss this one further; just trying to show what I think are valid\nreasons to justify that decision, and also to not keep adding other\nstuff there.\n"
