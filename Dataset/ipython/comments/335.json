But one key point\nis that the installation MUST always work without setuptools in the\npicture.  So the scripts do need to be registered in normal\nnon-setuptools fashion.\n\nNow, perhaps what we should do is, in find_scripts, have something like\n\n<pre>\nif 'setuptools' in sys.modules:\n return []\n</pre>\n\n\nso that a setuptools-driven installation doesn't produce duplicate scripts.\n\nf\n"

I would love it if\nsetuptools could use existing script definitions, but as far as I know\nit does its own thing separately.\n\nThere is a cleaner solution, perhaps, but it requires a little bit\nmore work.  Easy work, though: we make a base find_scripts() function\nthat returns more information; instead of a simple list of pathds, it\nreturns paths, package names and function entry points, in some\nsuitable data structure (a dict seems the obvious choice).\n\nAnd we have find_scripts_distutils and find_scripts_setuptools that\nget called in the branches of the \"if setuptools\" block.  These two\ncall the same base find_scripts(), but they each parse it differently,\nto make distutils/setuptools happy.\n\nHow does that sound?  It's easy to implement.\n\nCheers,\n\nf\n"
