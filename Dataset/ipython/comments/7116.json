    "body": "@takluyver I hadn't until you asked.  I think even with kernel/comm/widget docs, coupling the JS API docs to the PY API docs isn't worth the trouble.  However, it's probably be a good idea to:  \n- have a high level index file, that allows you to access either the PY API or JS API index page  \n- try to find a style for both the PY API and JS API html that's consistent\n\n... in a separate PR of course.\n\nYou and the others (@Carreau @minrk @ellisonbg) should be aware of a caveat to the JSDoc parser that I discovered.  In order for it to support minimalistic comments, without all the JSDoc tagging junk, the comment must come before the function signature.  If we want the comment to follow the function signature, we have to use a magic JSDoc tag to tell JSDoc that the comment represents a function, what the name of that function is, and what namespace it belongs to.\n\nWe have the following two options:\n\n``` js\n/**\n * This method does this and that.\n */\nMyClass.prototype.dosomething = function() {\n};\n```\n\nOr:\n\n``` js\nMyClass.prototype.dosomething = function() {\n    /**\n     * This method does this and that.\n     * @function module:mymodule~MyClass#dosomething\n     */\n};\n```\n\nI strongly prefer the first.  It'd be very easy to forget everything about JSDoc paths and I don't mind the function comment appearing before the function as much as everyone else seems to.\n"

Looks like some of the big names in the industry also use comments before function signatures:\n\nGoogle JS Standards:\nhttps://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml?showone=Comments#Comments\n\nMozilla JS Standards:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Coding_Style\n\nI know... \"If your friends jump off a bridge does that mean you will you too?\"  But I think in this case, it's better to think about the opposite, \"If your friends don't jump off the bridge does that mean you will jump off it?\".\n\nAside, looks like M$ decided to jump off the bridge:\nhttps://ajaxcontroltoolkit.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Style%20Guidelines&referringTitle=Read%20the%20Ajax%20Control%20Toolkit%20Coding%20Standards\nLiterally the opposite of Google's standards, `//` prefixed, after the signature, and xml tags.\n"
