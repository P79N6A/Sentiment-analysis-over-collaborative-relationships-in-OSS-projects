    "body": "- It's possible there is Windows-specific behavior.\n- pyreadline is not involved at all in the qtconsole.\n\nBut now I'm confused about what the bug is supposed to be. I don't see any incorrect behavior in your GIF.  If you press ↑, it should search the history only for blocks with a matching prefix (the line leading up to the cursor). In the case of your long line, there are no previous lines with a similar prefix, so there are no matches through which to cycle. That's why pressing up at the beginning of the line works - no prefix matches all history entries.\n"

Now, due to the \"matching prefix\" rule mentioned by @minrk, history navigation \"breaks\", in the sense that you have to go back to the beginning (not the end) of the line to keep navigating up in the history.\n"

If this is still relevant I would suggest this issue to be reopened on the above cited repository. \n\nThis will allow us to keep the number of IPython issues smaller and focussed on IPython. As currently there is an extremely high number of opened issues , it make it really hard to find if a problem is actually known, or going to be worked one. \n\nFeel free to reopen if need, for the time being I'm going to close this. \n\nThanks.\n"
