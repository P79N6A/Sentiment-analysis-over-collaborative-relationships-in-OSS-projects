    "body": "> I would change the behavior to embed=True unless url kwarg is explicitly given\n\nThis seems pretty reasonable to me.  From the notebook's perspective, I still think when an Image is given by URL, it _rarely_ is actually desirable to embed the image, which has several disadvantages (in size, elegance, performance, etc.).  But if this has to be done with `Image(url='http...)`, and that makes default behavior less surprising, perhaps we should do it.\n\nThe costs of this change:\n- increased notebook size\n- increased unnecessary b64 data in notebook\n- increased cost of displaying images (b64 encoding / decoding)\n- increased network traffic when displaying images / loading notebook\n  - kernel downloads image, never caching\n  - kernel sends b64 image to Browser, which is significantly larger than the original\n  - circumvents browser cache of images from urls\n\nThe benefits:\n- consistency between QtConsole and Notebook\n- Notebooks more likely to be complete in offline viewing\n"
