Maybe it's up to the user to configure a headless backend, or maybe MPL's \"inside IPython\" check should also check whether it's in a headless environment.

The trade off has historically been in favor of the interactive users and preventing the \"no plot showed up\" bug and letting the \"I can not use an interactive backend on a headless server\" bug happen because in the later case the user gets a clear error as to what is wrong.\r\n\r\nThere was some discussion recently about how to support \"which ever Qt flavor is installed\" as a backend and how to do backend fallbacks, but it gets a tricky in general because GUI frameworks tend to step on each other's toes if you import them simultaneously.
