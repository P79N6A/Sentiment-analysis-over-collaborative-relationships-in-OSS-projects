    "body": "I am in the middle of writing the email to ipython lists about this, because I just cut that pyzmq release today, but you were too quick!\n\n0.11 uses a string comparison for checking the pyzmq version, but this obviously doesn't work once you get into double digits.  This was fixed in master some time ago, so updating to IPython master (or using pyzmq dev) will avoid the issue.\n\nThe issue came up more quickly than anticipated, because libzmq 2.1.5, 2.1.6, and 2.1.8 all had serious bugs, and were superceded immediately, which is how zeromq made it all the way from 2.1.4 in May to 2.1.10 in October.\n\nIf you must use released versions of code for some reason, then you must install pyzmq-2.1.9 to work with IPython 0.11.\n\nThere are quite a few bugfixes in IPython trunk (as well as the notebook!), and 0.12 is not far off.\n"

The issue has been fixed in IPython master already, so if you simply update to git master of IPython, it's already gone.  You can either do a full git clone, or download a current tarball from the downloads button: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/zipball/master.\n\nI'm closing it b/c it's actually already fixed in our master.  Let us know if you need any help with the update so you can work around this.\n"
