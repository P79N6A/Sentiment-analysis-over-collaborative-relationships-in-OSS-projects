    "body": "`IPython.utils.tempdir import NamedFileInTemporaryDirectory` act much more as a context manager and has quite a different behavior than mktemp. In particular it opens the file  and wait to have cleanup called on it which close the file. \nWhich I don't want as mktemp just create a file with data and close it. The will be reopened at a later point by the editor.\n\nI could used it, but it would require quite some change / addition : \nOption not to keep the file open, ability to get file abspath, ability to pass some data to write to the file. \n\nUsing it as a context manager could be doable, but would require significant rework of the %edit magic and `_find_edit_target`.\n\nSo I'm not 100% sure it is worth.\n"
