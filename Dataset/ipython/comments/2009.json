The drawback here is that they show up twice on all listings as we have no concept of 'real' aliases.\n2. Leave them for now but deprecated and remove later on.\n3. Build up machinery to have a first-class concept of magic aliases.  That's what this PR was doing.\n\nI'm starting to think that 3 is just too much complexity for a fairly obscure feature.  But if we want to avoid more user habit breakage, a good alternative would be to go with 1, with an implementation of `magic_alias` that simply auto-creates the new method with a standard docstring that reads `Alias for magic %foo, see its docstring for details`.\n\nThat would give us no deprecation but at least short docstrings for the duplicates in the big `%magic` listing and an easy to use interface for users who may like to add their own aliases.\n\nI actually like this as a design brief, what do you guys think?\n"
