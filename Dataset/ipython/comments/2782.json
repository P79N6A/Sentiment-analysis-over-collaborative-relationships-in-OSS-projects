    "body": "An alternative approach, which might have been simpler, would have been something more like:\n\n``` python\nbp_cmd = opts.get('b', [1])[0]\nif ':' not in bp_cmd:\n    bp_cmd = filename + ':' + bp_cmd\n# ...\ndeb.do_break(bp_cmd)\n```\n\nBut I'm not sure if `deb.do_break` would have run through all of the same `checkline` code that we do.  As a side effect, this might have allowed breaking at function names (but I never implemented it to test it, so there might be other unexpected issues which would prevent that from working anyway).\n\nFor now I think the proposed patch here is plenty fine.\n"
