    "body": "FWIW the failing test seems to be due to a difference in how the signatures module handles method signatures between Python 2 and Python 3.  On Python 2 it drops the `self` argument.  However on Python 3 there are no longer unbound methods per se, so this different behavior of `MethodType` is passed over.\n\nI know from recent experience it's possible to work around this, but I would consider it an upstream bug in the signatures module backport.  In the meantime I think the behavior of dropping the `self` argument from method signatures is a Good Thing.  The question is where to fix this so that it's consistent.\n"
