    "body": "Ah, right, it's the function signature. It's the content of the rubbish, not the size of it, that's the issue. It's a series of random bytes, which we attempt to decode into unicode to send (because json strings are unicode, not bytes). That much is OK, using the replacement character a lot. However, some of the bytes randomly happen to be valid UTF-8 sequences, so they are decoded and sent as unicode code points. Then on the receiving end, the json decoder sees a code point from the range dedicated to surrogate pairs, which causes it to throw a wobbly.\n\nUgh, that's fiddly. There are two things we could change, both with some drawbacks:\n- Send the `repr()` of bytes strings in object info, rather than trying to decode them. The downside is that, on Python 2, people often use bytestrings to represent text, so you might want it to appear as 'café', not 'caf\\xc3\\xa9'. (I've just tested, and the error doesn't occur on Python 3)\n- Catch any failures to decode to parse Javascript. In the case of an `object_info_reply`, the program can continue happily without it. But we don't know what type of message it is until we've parsed it, and ignoring them all could make debugging tricky later.\n"

It only manifests itself when the bytes happen to form a UTF-8 sequence, and that happens to represent a code point from the surrogate pairs range. Oh, and it only occurs on wide-unicode Python builds, which I think are mainly on Linux.\n\nIt's not just function signatures, unfortunately. If you construct crc32 then do `print crc32.func_defaults[1]`, you get a similar error. The minimal case is `print u'\\udc00'.encode('utf-8')`.\n\nPerhaps, when we prepare the JSON to send, we should replace any surrogate code points with the object replacement character (�). Although ideally we'd avoid doing that for valid surrogate pairs, which will be in use on narrow-unicode Python builds, like those on Windows.\n"
