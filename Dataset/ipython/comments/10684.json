Though I strongly feel this is due from (mis)-using sudo. "

But you having to sudo-chmod with homebrew is a really bad sign that something is wrong with your system. I would likely run a `brew doctor` and/or nuke my brew python install then reinstall python3. Usually with Python and/or brew if you have to use sudo then something is deeply wrong and things are only going to get worse with time."
