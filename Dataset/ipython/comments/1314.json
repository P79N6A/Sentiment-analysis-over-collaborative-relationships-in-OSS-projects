    "body": "Implementation wise I think you did a great job, it looks clean and slick.  However...\n\nI hate to say this, but I personally don't like it _at all_, because it has a non-trivial cost in vertical space.  I measured and on my laptop, I can fit 9 1/2 one-line cells with one-line output using current master, and with this applied I can only fit 8 1/2, so there's a ~10% loss of usable vertical space.  Given that 10 cells total is already very little to begin with, losing anything at this point really hurts, big time.\n\nFurthermore, creating a new cell with the mouse isn't all that useful to me, since I'll immediately need to go back to the keyboard to type again, so it's a fairly flow-disrupting action.\n\nNow, I also realize that this is most likely to benefit less experienced/advanced users, who may prefer a mouse action to remembering a keybinding or using a menu option...\n\nBut the benefit to new users would need to be really huge to justify the loss of extremely valuable real estate forever.  It's kind of like soldering the training wheels onto the bike, so you can never get rid of them even once you know how to ride, and you're stuck with this annoyance forever.\n\nSorry to take this view, but huge -1 on this one from me.  If there's overwhelming user demand for this feature, I'm willing to discuss it, obviously...\n"

    "body": "Another option is to add a small context menu to the right of each cell to insert new cell below or delete that cell.  Instead of taking up vertical space, this could just take up the last couple of characters of width of the cell.\n\nPersonally, I think it would be better to add this or the triangle above on the right side, so it's not visually cluttering up the start of the lines of code.\n\nOne problem that we have in Sage is that the \"blue bar\" (small div between cells to add a new cell) is not very easy to discover or target, and it's not obvious that shift-click adds a text cell.  We've played with the idea of adding explicit \"code\" and \"text\" links to the div.  I'm interested in seeing what you guys come up with for a UI.\n"

BUT, I don't like the fact that this makes the UI have a flashy feel, meaning that things flash on/off as you move around.  Our current api is so clean and simple and I am very hesitant to clutter it up in this way.  I also agree that the vertical space is an issue that we don't want to compromise on.  Some options:\n- We just abandon this idea.\n- We try to go with @Carreau s idea of making a less flash, less vertical space sucking icon on the L.\n- We could also provide an option in the view menu to collapse this space for advanced users wanting the simpler UI and more vertical space.\n"

I'm happy if advanced users need to tweak a few things for their use patterns, and I think the out-of-the-box experience should favor the new users.  What I don't like are things that are impossible to change once a user advances in his/her use patterns to more advanced ones and doesn't need the 'training wheels' anymore.\n\nI'm not crazy about the little triangle icon @Carreau suggested only b/c it seems really small, and super-small targets are harder to hit.  Your original solution had the advantage of being huge in one dimension, and hence required much less hand-eye fine coordination to hit: you only had to be somewhat precise on one axis, not on both.\n\nAnd I do agree with you @ellisonbg, in that the flashiness can be annoying.  For some reason yours flashes less than the blue bar in Sage, which I actually find a little distracting, so yours didn't bother me as much.  But still, I'm not crazy about visually flashing UI elements either.\n"

    "body": "Just to record my current take on this here (Brian and I had a skype chat): I vote for not doing this now, and wait until we can add UI control at the per-cell level done correctly.  Since we want to expose things like cell metadata, eventually we know we're going to have to figure out a solution to small UI controls per-cell, perhaps with a menu raised by the prompt area.  That would be a spatially local menu (being spatially close to the action is one advantage of the current PR that I acknowledge) while not having any cost in terms of vertical space or UI flashing visually.\n\nSo that's my vote; wait for now (there's still the menus and keybindings, so there are ways of getting new cells) and implement a clean solution later rather than hack in something that flashes and costs vertical space.\n"
