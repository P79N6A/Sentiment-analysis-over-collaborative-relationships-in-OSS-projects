I remain +1 on that (after 4.0 and big split are done).\n\n@jdfreder already looked at fixing the Files tab scroll issue for the 3.0 release. At the time, we were still scrolling the entire page. With the whole page scroll, it was a complete mess to fix this for the Files tab while leaving the Running and Cluster tab the same. Now that we are back to scrolling just the site div, it may be easier - I had forgotten that the page doesn't scroll any longer.\n\nLet's see if some variant of the affix CSS class can get this to work.\n"

However, I wouldn't use Javascript to fix things that are supposed to be done in pure CSS.\n\n@Carreau \n\nWhen I was writing the PR for a fixed header, I noticed that `position: sticky;` doesn't really work as a replacement of `position: fixed;` at least without a careful consideration of the layout.  `sticky` has the effect of hiding the header when the parent no longer fits the page. Since the browser support is not good at all, I didn't look deep enough to make it work. However, let's say it doesn't work \"out of the box\".\n"
