    "body": "Interesting. \n1. The kernels seem to start up okay standalone.\n2. Something very wonky is going on with QtConsole. When I run it my entire system gets locked up, requiring a reboot. From the console output I see it looks like Qt is attempting to make a window that is bigger than the maximum size and so  some widget is failing to instantiate.\n3. The output looks fairly normal, to my eye. \nhttps://gist.github.com/2651743\n\nHowever, it seems that you are right. The notebook kernels are dropping into Z+ mode straight away, a new zombie process for each time around the \"dead kernel loop.\" What could be making the kernels die right off the hop like that?\n\nEDIT: I've worked around the initial QtConsole lock-up... some issue when using Qt with GTK+. I'll look into it later. That aside, I get the same behavior when running QtConsole as the notebook: instant Z+ kernels.\nMy first thought was to start a standalone kernel and then connect qtconsole to it, but it seems that now not even standalone kernels will start (previously I was able to observe them start, but now they don't show up in ps at all). The output from starting a kernel and corresponding connection file are here:\nhttps://gist.github.com/2652058\n\nEDIT2: The problem persists after installing ipython into a brand new, stripped down python environment (not epd). I built/installed each dependency one-by-one as per the docs. Of course some issue with my system-wide shared libraries could still be causing the problem.\n\nEDIT3: Tested again in a completely stripped down VM (lucid64 running on top of windows), again built everything up from scratch. IPython works in this scenario. It seems that either I've muddled up some library somewhere (somehow I suspect zmq still, although I'm not sure precisely how) or it has to do with the version of Ubuntu (12.04 vs 10.04, unfortunately I don't have a 12.04 VM image lying around). \n"

Adjusting the times mentioned in #1232 solved the kernel restart problem, but in either configuration password protection does not work. What should be the redirect call has no data in the response. I have tested this same configuration on other machines with no issues.\n\nAny ideas on how to get password protection working?\n"
