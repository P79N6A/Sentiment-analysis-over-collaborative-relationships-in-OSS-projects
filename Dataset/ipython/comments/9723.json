    "body": "It seems that due to the limited color capability of the Windows console (16 color palette) prompt-toolkit is converting the RGB colors to one of the 16 builtin colors but the conversion doesn't seem to get it right for the bright colors.\n\nAlso the default Pygments style that is used seems to use some dark colors for example dark blue, which is unusable on a black background terminal. (IPython before 5 used to use the lighter blue). Try reading this:\n\n![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2670892/16738983/c36bc87e-47a0-11e6-87cb-72e9a4b98edf.PNG)\n\nThis might mean that we need to tweak the default Pygments style used to use lighter colors on dark terminals. Pygments has a TerminalFormatter which has a dark/light bg argument but that class doesn't use the standard Pygments styles which prompt-toolkit does.\n\nFor now, unless I built a custom color configuration that essentially restores IPython before 5 colors, this version is unusable on Windows. This can hurt newcomers quite badly too...\n"

    "body": "I didn't think the colours in the oinspect output (`os.path.exists??`) had changed for 5.0. @Carreau, could your changes to the colour system have affected the ANSI codes we produce? Otherwise, it could be a difference in how the ANSI colour codes are translated to Windows API calls; previously pyreadline was responsible for that translation, now colorama is.\n\nWe can't in general detect what the background colour is, so we try to make the default colours visible on both black and white. This is complicated by the fact that the same colours get rendered differently in different systems. Maybe we should assume that there's a dark background on Windows, though - I think it's pretty unusual for Windows users to have a light background command window.\n"

But also keep in mind that Windows consoles only have 16 colors, which are configurable. IPython does not have that much control of which actual colors the user assigns to these 16 colors.\n\n@takluyver, not sure if we could use some slightly different colors for Windows. For ptpython, I have hardcoded a color scheme that seems to work well on Windows: https://github.com/jonathanslenders/ptpython/blob/master/ptpython/style.py#L52\n"

I couldn't find a single place describing format and place which I should change:\n  -- should that be console (http://jupyter-console.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_options.html) or terminal (http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/options/terminal.html)\n  -- what's the format, as plain \"InteractiveShell.colors='Linux'\" in .jupyter_console_config.py leads to NameError\n\nCurrent status is that after entering %colors linux docstrings are more readable, but that doesn't solve prompt issue:\n\nIn [7]: from collect\n\ncollect colors are different than those in docstrings\n\nSorry for being chaotic and/or inaccurate, I'm writing things from ordinary Windows ipython/jupyter perspective.\n\nRegards,\nRobert\n"
