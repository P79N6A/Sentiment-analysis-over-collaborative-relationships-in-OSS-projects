    "body": "The reason for `_repr_png` , `_repr_jpg` is that image can be displayed in frontend other than notebook or qtconsole. \nEg, the ZMQ console have a hook that display image in external viewer, I'm not sure the emacs mode does support the embeding of HTML but it does for jpg and png. \nAlso we want to move away from base64 because of the overhead and the bad VCS compliance. So this solution is IMHO not the good one. \n"
