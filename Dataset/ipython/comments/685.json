    "body": "This is super useful, but I think it would be really good to have even a short paragraph illustrating this in the docs.  Not all users are familiar with the details of ssh tunneling, so I'm sure a short illustrative example will do lots of good here.\n\nOtherwise, the code looks solid (and the current test suite still passes) but I'm a little concerned that there's no test coverage at all, despite a fair amount of new functionality.  I know that testing multiprocess things like this is super tricky, but even some light tests that at least do api validation will help us catch silly mistakes in the future.  Obviously if you can think of some robust tests for it, that would be even better.\n\nBeyond some docs and testing, it looks otherwise great for merging.  Thanks for the excellent work, this will be very useful!\n"
