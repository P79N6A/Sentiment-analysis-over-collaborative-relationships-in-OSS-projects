    "body": "Hi @neocarlitos,\n\nI'm glad you like the nbconvert latex output.  If I were you, I would write a notebook extension, that would allow you to set the figure caption/labels in the notebook.  The data could be stored in the custom metadata of the cell.  In nbconvert, a custom template which inherits from the base latex template could be used to read that data and use it with correct latex code.  You _may_ find that you need a preprocessor to condition the metadata before the template, but I think you can do it without.\n\nCheers,\nJon\n"
