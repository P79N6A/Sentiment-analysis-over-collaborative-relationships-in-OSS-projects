But by accident, I had just finished testing his branch\nand left my checkout there, and started doing something else without\nrealizing that.\n\n> Because this bug does not exist in master for me (just tested Linux, Windows, and OSX).\n\nOK, thanks.  That's great to hear.  @takluyver, that means that a test\nof this kind should be added to your pickle branch, so that a) it gets\nfixed there b) we have a safety in place for this in the future.\n"

It's going to be tricky to test, though, because in the test environment, `user_ns` and `user_global_ns` are already separate objects. In fact, I'm not quite sure why we need two user namespaces - can anyone enlighten me?\n"
