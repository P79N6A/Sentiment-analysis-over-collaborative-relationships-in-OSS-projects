    "body": "If you have IPython configured to use SSL and you are using an nginx proxy, that means you are requiring that nginx make an https connection to the notebook server behind the proxy. That doesn't have any effect on whether the connection to the outside world should use SSL, though. I'm not sure that's actually what you are after. Typically with nginx you do SSL termination at the proxy, and use http for the local connections, in which case you would configure nginx to use SSL, but IPython would _not_ have any SSL configuration.\n"
