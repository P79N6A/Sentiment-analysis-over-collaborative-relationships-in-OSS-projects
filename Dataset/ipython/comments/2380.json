I can confirm that for me, master produces the problem 100% of the time, and #2294 completely fixes it.  It's a bummer that #2294 is such a delicate one that we've decided to keep out of 0.13.1, because I would say that this bug is a major one.  Giving people a busted matplotlib 1.2.x with Qt is a real downer...\n"
