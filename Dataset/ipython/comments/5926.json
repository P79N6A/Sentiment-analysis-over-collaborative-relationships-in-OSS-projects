Besides this, and the problems with skipped history, I also find that pure terminal from a command prompt will only give me one line at a time of previous multi-line entries.  All but the last (haven't tried) I've replicated on both WinPython & Anaconda, Python 2.7.x, IPython 1.1, 1.2, 2.0, and 2.1.  (And 1.3, if there was a 1.3 I'm forgetting).\n"
