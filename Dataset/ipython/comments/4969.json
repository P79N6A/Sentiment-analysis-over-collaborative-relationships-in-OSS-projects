    "body": "I believe our pylab machinery (`IPython.core.pylabtools`) overrides the backend selection in matplotlibrc. I don't know much about mpl, but I guess someone must have determined that Gtk3Agg made more sense as a default than Gtk3Cairo.\n\nDo you experience any actual problems with matplotlib using Gtk3Agg? It might simply be that the warning is out of date. It [looks like](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/1227) matplotlib now only warns if it doesn't find the cairocffi module, but no-one actually seems to say that it outright doesn't work on pycairo.\n"
