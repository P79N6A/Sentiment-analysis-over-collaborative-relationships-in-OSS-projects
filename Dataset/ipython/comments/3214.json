    "body": "This is because argparse accepts any leading fraction of a flag to be specified, so `--no-brow` actually successfully specifed `--no-browser`, but the code that scrubs flags from the args to be relayed down to the Kernel does not do this, so `--no-brow` doesn't get scrubbed.  I don't know if there's a flag in argparse to disable this behavior. Anyone aware of one?\n"
