    "body": "The original reason we moved to using jinja templates is that we were having an explosion of `config=True` attributes to allow the configuration of everything.  This PR reminds me of that insanity and I really don't think we want to go there.  More and more I am thinking that we need to refactor our LaTeX templates to make them easier to extend by template overloading.  I know the LaTeX templates are currently not setup in that way, but we need to get there.\n\nI am fine with this going in for now, but please keep in mind that when we clean up the LaTeX templates (in the next week or so) we will likely kill these specific attributes in favor of template overloading.\n\n@minrk @jdfreder @Carreau do you think we should towards using templates for this type of customization?\n"

    "body": "I think there are two classes of customization that are emerging:\n- Simple key, value type things like papersize, author, title, latex class, etc that need to be injected into the document.  There are essentially an infinite number of these and I think they should all be handled by template overloading.\n- Complex things that are difficult to implement/customize and which significantly change the structure of the document.  Things in this category are input/output/prompts/wrapping/pagination.  This stuff is too complex for most users to manage and I think we should try to find a way to make it easy for users to select what they want without diving into all the gory details.  This is why I am thinking that the code_cell_style should be in this category.\n\nMaybe the distinction is artificial though - I am more than willing to consider other approaches.\n"
