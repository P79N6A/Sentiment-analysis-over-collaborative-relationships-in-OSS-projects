    "body": "Yes, this is a known issue, and we want to move the language in the top level metadata field instead of per cell, in next notebook format. \n\nin the meantime, I suggest to tag notebooks in metadata like [IJulia does](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl/blob/master/deps/custom.js#L52), so that conversion can be eased later. (I saw that you already patch codemirror to get ruby mode, so it won't be too complicated for you (be carefull btw, your `$getscript(` will not work if notebook run with a prefixed URL), pr are welcomed on nbconvert to detect/highlight ruby.\n"
