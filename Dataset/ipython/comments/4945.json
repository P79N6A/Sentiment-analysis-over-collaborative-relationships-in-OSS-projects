    "body": "Hi @montefra, the latex templates and nbconvert have been completely re-worked since the merge into IPython master.  I just tested running `latex` on the output of `ipython nbconvert notebook.ipynb --to latex` and I was able to get a working .dvi file that renders almost the same as the pdf output from `pdflatex`.  If you can verify that you still have a problem, please tell me and I will re-open the issue.\n"
