    "body": "I _think_ if you do a clean reinstall of IPython, the first failure (profile lists not matching) should go away.  The `pylab` profile has been removed, and you may have a stale install (or simply build dir) where this file still exists.  If you cleanup your IPython install and build/dist dirs, I would expect this one to go away.\n\nThe other failure is clearly encoding related, and thus _might_ somehow have to do with the `xterm` setting.  All the locale stuff is very confusing, and clearly IPython is making some assumption it shouldn't be.  Have you seen any weird unicode behavior in IPython itself (printing unicode, or entering unicode literals)?  It's possible this one is just an issue in the test suite itself.\n\nWhat do you get for: \n\n```\npython -c 'import locale; print locale.getpreferredencoding()'\n```\n\n?\n"
