Some quick thoughts before I forget:\n- Unfortunate that inline math isn't done with a single `$` like standard latex/mathjax.  Might be possible to get them to change.\n- I didn't see mention of anything for bibliography references.\n- It has a rst-like extension model (which markdown lacks), so that might let us fix the bib problem.\n- Is there a JS renderer? The reference implementation is ruby, which won't work client-side.\n"

    "body": "Hi @JanSchulz:\n- Server load is actually critical: a single notebook server can be potentially handling many open notebooks, and it should block as little as possible on render operations. So we always want to keep the notebook server very lightweight.\n- Latency: having higher latency on every _render_ operation would degrade the experience. It's natural to expect higher latency when executing code, simply because the computation may take a while to run. But if every time you exit a text area it takes a few seconds to render it, the UX really suffers.\n- Simplicity. The amount of networking machinery that would have to be added for this to be done server-side is much more than you think.  We don't particularly like JS, but in this case, keeping that logic in the client _is_ simpler.\n\nFor all these reasons, we keep client-side render as a requirement.  This is something we've thought a lot about and have considered pretty carefully, and right now we're pretty confident it's the right design approach.\n"
