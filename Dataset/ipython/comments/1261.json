    "body": "Great job!!! Functionality works great, and I think we can move forward even if it's only for code cells now.  In any case, those are the ones where it matters most (I don't think there are nearly as many reasons for wanting to merge/split text cells).  A few questions:\n- From looking at the code, I wonder if we couldn't make the text cells reuse the same code by having all cells have a `get_content` method.  Because ultimately, the logic should be the same, regardless of whether the content is code or text.\n- Though we don't have it implemented right now, we should think about what to do regarding cell metadata, which we know we'll have soon.  On split, it should just be copied to both children, but how to go about it on merge?  Something to keep in mind when we tackle exactly what/how much cell metadata to allow and how it will be stored.\n\nRegarding the edit menu, I think it's still OK but I agree we're about at the limit.  We could do what LyX uses, they have plain 'paste', but submenus for 'paste special' and 'paste recent', which have a few options each.  That is: keep the most common option available at the top-level, and create sub-menus for the others.\n"

    "body": "About the `get_content` idea: I am planning on refactoring the abstract Cell API when I add heading cells.  We need a more uniform interface for these things.  That will also simplify the code for switching between cell types.  I will wait to implement text cell splitting once that happens.\n\nOn the menu and shortcut issues, I think we should leave it as is and see how it goes.\n\nOn the cell level metadata, let's cross that bridge when we get there.  But how this will be handled in a merge operation is good to keep in the back of ours heads for latter.\n"
