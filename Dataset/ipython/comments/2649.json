But probably a list in the header won't give you any significant penalty?  I can't tell, as I don't do any benchmarks.\n\nMore important than that, if it is in the header, client needs to send a no-op message to get that.  I guess `execute_reply` with an empty code does the job but maybe it is not straight forward for client writer.\n\n---\n\nBTW I'd write it this way:\n\n``` python\ndef msg_header(**kwds):\n    kwds.update(date=datetime.now(), version=_version_info_list)\n    return kwds\n```\n"

    "body": "Okay, then if we are adding this, I would suggest a few changes:\n- the protocol version should live in zmq.session, _not_ ipkernel.  session is where the protocol implementation is.\n- the version info currently included in the header should be removed, as it is wasteful and redundant.\n- the version request should reply with more information (at least IPython version, msg spec version, Python version, and maybe even platform info).  This message should be the only one we need for a whole \"who are you, and what are your capabilities\"\n- a version tuple makes more sense than a dict that duplicates its own content\n\nI think using semantic versioning is fine, but may be overkill - a 'bugfix' to a protocol definition doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but people generally expect 3-part versions, so we might as well use it, even if the last field is always zero.\n"

The spec is meant to handle this, so it seems this is the place for such a Kernel to identify itself. We could use 'ipython' by default, and if we ever bring back the pure-Python kernel, we would call it 'ipython-pure' or something.\n- platform - It could be defined on a per-language basis, rather than trying to force each language to conform to Python's `platform.platform()`.\n\nIf these aren't easily settled, we can go with the 4-key version above for now, and add more as we discover a need for them.\n"
