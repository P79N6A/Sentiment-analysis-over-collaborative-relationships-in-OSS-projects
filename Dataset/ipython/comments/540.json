    "body": "Pinging @fperez and @bgranger.  This specifically supports `-pylab` _only_.  Flags still require `--` prefix.  An alternative would be to accept single-`-` prefix for all flags.  This would be more natural for flags like `ipython -i` for force-interactive.  Leaving it as-is gives us a place to add something new in the future.\n"

    "body": "My take on this is to be conservative for now.  `-pylab` is special because it's extremely widely documented, so we don't really want everyone's scripts, aliases and habits to break everywhere.  We'll have to fine-tune our handling of command-line args after more extensive field use and feedback, so I'd suggest we stick, for now, to the bare minimum of tweaks until we can collect such information post-0.11.\n"
