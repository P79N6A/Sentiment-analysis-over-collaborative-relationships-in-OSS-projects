    "body": "Well if you `git reset --hard  32642d8` that will bring you back to before you tried to do the rebase. \nthe thing to keep in mind with git is that the `sha` of a commit is alway referring to a particular state and most likely unique across all existing repository of the earth for hundreds of year. \n\nSo `32642d84625a7a5115c8a0ce45a7dca540f6c3b1` to be exact refer to the state of the PR you submitted. \n\nthe `reset --hard <sha>` will just tell your tardis/dolorean (depending on your preferences) to bring you exactly as this state of space time. \n\n`rebase` came in 2 flavors, `rebase` and `rebase -i` (for interactive), the second one allow you to pick what you want and don't want on final rebase. \n\nAs I cloned my repo from `ipython/ipython` directly, I can directly refer to the current state of the main repo as being `origin/master` (you might not if you cloned from `amcdawes/ipython`) so rebasing on `origin/master`or `upstream/master` (after a git fetch) prevent me from having to `$ git checkout master`; `git pull`; without having to worry of wether master is up to date, then reswithch to what I am doing. \n\nRight now you seem to be on `b9c9b4f`\n\n```\n~/ipython (rebase-32642d8) $ git reset --hard b9c9b4f\nHEAD is now at b9c9b4f Merge branch 'i7424' of https://github.com/amcdawes/ipython into i7424\n\n~/ipython (rebase-32642d8) $ git rebase -i origin/master\n#vim opens\n```\n\n```\n  1 pick 3f0140d fixed Notebook Help item as specified by ellisonbg\n  2 pick b606309 rebase and fix conflict from #7429\n  3 pick 32642d8 fixed Notebook Help item as specified by ellisonbg\n  4 \n  5 # Rebase 7b16447..b9c9b4f onto 7b16447$\n  6 # Some explanation\n  7 # .....\n```\n\nif you `esc``:wq` it would be just like a classical rebase.   What you will do is delete the first two line telling that you \"only\" want `32642d8` (`dd` in vi, but you can configure your editor :-P)  \n\nSave and quit, and then continue as in my first example, then force push. Tada ! \n"
