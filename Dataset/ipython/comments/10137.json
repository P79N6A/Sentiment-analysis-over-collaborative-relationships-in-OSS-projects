    "body": "which backend are you using?  Does running `plt.ion()` or `%matplotlib` help?\r\n\r\nMy knee-jerk / making this up as I go guess is: When IPython de-coupled from readline, it also decoupled from the `PyOS_InputHook` machinery.   In the plain python case, the GUI is starting up (starting the bouncing), the GUI code installs the hook, and when it finishes starting up some how phones home to let the rocket know to stop bouncing because the gui main loop runs intercolated with the repl.  In IPython, that hook is still installed, but does not matter because IPython is running through prompt toolkit.  If you start up the IPython event loop integration the GUI will phone home and stop the bouncing.\r\n\r\nOr I could be wildly off base."
