    "body": "in #5152 @minrk also suggested hiding directories that start with a `.`, do you disagree with that?\n\nPersonally, I think it's weird to hide directories that start with an underscore - some people rename files/directories to have a leading `_` as a way to ensure they are listed first. But if we're going to hide those directories, we should also hide directories that start with a dot.\n\nHiding `__pycache__` and only `__pycache__` makes more sense to me - it is the least surprising behavior.\n"
