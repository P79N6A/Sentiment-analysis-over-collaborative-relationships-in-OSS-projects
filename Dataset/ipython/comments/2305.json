    "body": "+1 to this approach.  When a traceback is being rendered, execution is stopping anyway, so micro-optimizing to make the stack one frame shallower isn't really necessary.\n\nPlease check, however, that after this patch the traceback in various scenarios look OK.  We have some fairly brittle logic in a  few places that has hardcoded the 'distance' (measured in number of stack frames) between the user code and the traceback-handling code.  So this extra frame may mess up that logic and need adjusting (I'm not sure it does, just asking that you check to be sure, as errors like that may not be detected in our test suite).\n"
