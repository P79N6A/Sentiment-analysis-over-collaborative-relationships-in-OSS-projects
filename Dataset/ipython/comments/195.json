The job of printing prompts is a purely client-side business now, and for example the Qt console doesn't even make them customizable at all (at least not yet).  So the kernel shouldn't be making those decisions.\n\nThe output should just be sent to the client without further modification, and only the client should be responsible for deciding how to display it. Eventually, even the checks for any newlines shouldn't be there, as some clients may display prompts in a separate box so that they don't need to worry about newlines.  But don't remove those yet, as the terminal client code would need to be fixed accordingly, so that's probably best done elsewhere (unless you want to commit to the whole cleanup job).\n- Could you format new files according to the guidelines here?\n  http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/nightly/html/development/coding_guide.html#new-files\n\nThese are minor points, once taken care of it looks good to me.  Thanks!\n"
