    "body": "Was working on one of my other things [hy_kernel](/bollwyvl/hy_kernel), and re-encountered the kernelspec. For that, I had gone with a spec as close as possible to IPKernel, and at install time (when installing the `kernel.json`) copy `hy/hy.js` into `profile/static/.../mode/hy`, which becomes part of the unioned static directory. works great! (except it doesn't, for some reason... still getting odd errors in travis, WFM).\n\nIn light of that experience, though, I would also like to propose that the `codemirror_mode` member of `language_info` also support the format used in [`CodeMirror/mode/meta.js`](/codemirror/CodeMirror/blob/master/mode/meta.js) i.e.:\n\n``` python\n﻿'codemirror_mode': {\n    'name': 'ipython',\n    'version': sys.version_info[0]\n},\n```\n\nand\n\n``` python\n﻿'codemirror_mode': {\n    'mode': 'ipython',\n    'mime': 'application/x-ipynb+json',\n    'version': sys.version_info[0]},\n    'ext': ['ipynb'],\n    'alias': ['notebook']\n}\n```\n\nIf that mode spec could be passed all the way to CM, this would allow the kernel writer to tune the end user experience much more carefully.\n\nThe other thing that would be nice, which the CM spec doesn't support (which may be argument enough against it), is a specific, overloaded location, bower package or otherwise. The one above works if the unioned static way is the way, I guess.\n\nAlternately, if _the right way_ for kernel authors install scripts will be the `nbextension` route, it seems like i should be able to say, for example:\n\n``` python\n'language_info': {\n  'codemirror_mode': {\n      'mode': 'hy',\n      'mime': 'text/x-hylang',\n      'version': __version__\n      'ext': ['hy'],\n      'alias': ['hylang'],\n      'nbextension': 'hy_kernel/codemirror/hy' # the new key, or...\n  }\n  'nbextension': 'hy_kernel' # maybe better\n}\n```\n\n...where the later assumes that at `hy_kernel`, there is `require`-able `index.js`, that among other things, will ensure that the codemirror mode from above is available.\n\nobviously, it could be named/put something/somewhere else, but i like the bower/nbextension namespacing idea, such that a kernel author only has to think about a single entry point, installed with a single command, etc.\n"

    "body": "What's the advantage of putting the mime type and extension into the codemirror mode? They're already in language_info as separate fields. And codemirror shouldn't need to know about them.\n\nWe're already concerned about how much information is being replicated in every notebook's metadata, so I'm wary of putting still more fields in there.\n\nAlso, while it's not really relevant, a couple of mistakes caught my eye:\n- The mime type and extension in the language info describe the language within the notebook, not the notebook itself, so it shouldn't be describing an ipynb file.\n- We've agreed to use the mimetype `application/x-ipynb+json` for the notebook format. Please don't use any other mimetype, even in examples, to avoid introducing confusion.\n"

    "body": "Hm, I was thinking about the `kernel.json` and/or the definition of the kernel class... is what a kernel needs to know when starting up and documenting itself necessarily the same as what must be stored in the notebook?\n\nAnyhow, I was basically thinking that when a `kernel.json` is found, that that data could be merged into `CodeMirror.modeInfo`, and mime-based lookup would work throughout. But that might be overkill, and not actually help the kernel developer as much, as it's being used for special things like python's `version`.\n\nIn my specific example, i need to provide a custom module, and right now the only way to do it is `profile/static/components/`... but was wondering if `nbextension` would be better.... _if_ i could document that that was needed.\n\nI guess, looking into it more, it really comes down to: \n\nFor the following cases:\n- markdown highlighting\n- cell editing\n- editor editing\n- others?\n\nAre the following things known:\n- a thing (object or string), that `CodeMirror.resolveMode` can handle, to yield a mode that can make a given chunk of content more readable\n- that that mode was loaded successfully at some point\n\nMy initial stuff was all based on the first use case, which is basically this key chunk of this PR:\n\n``` js\n        var info = (mode && modename && mode.mime && mode) ||\n            CodeMirror.findModeByName(modename) ||\n            CodeMirror.findModeByExtension(modename.split(\".\").slice(-1)) ||\n            CodeMirror.findModeByMIME(modename);\n```\n\nI also still like returning the mimetype to the callback vs whatever require happens to return.\n\nHowever, once the other cases must also be accounted for, it gets more complicated. \n"

On `master`, the text is just black. Changing it to `javascript` works:\n> > - before:\n> >   - ![nbviewer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/45380/5263988/feae21ea-7a04-11e4-84a0-c3f126714fea.png)\n> > - after:\n> >   - ![master](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/45380/5263987/fea87fc4-7a04-11e4-8dcc-1fd7cd11d883.png)\n\n---\n\nSo anyhooo:\nAfter highlightjs was dropped, many languages' syntax highlighting with markdown (a la GFM [name--or-extension-after-fenced-block-starts](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#syntax-highlighting)) stopped working, because, for example, there is no `json/json` mode. A `.language-json` is added, but this does nothing.\n\n> I think codemirror/mode/meta might make sens, but anything that you can do in custom.js Would be good in custom.js for the time being.\n\nIt seems unreasonable for a user, who is upgrading from 2.x and used to seeing syntax highlighted JSON (or whatever), to have to hack `custom.js` and `custom.css`. Per mode.\n\n> I haven't well understood the highlighting thing completly, cause I believe we do already load codemirror.css, but I might be missing something.\n\nCode and markdown cells use `.cm-s-ipython`, so the [`.cm-s-default`](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/blob/master/lib/codemirror.css#L93) rules don't hit.\n\n[`highlight.less`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/html/static/notebook/less/highlight.less) still has all the old highlightjs rules in it, which included more token types than the CM theme supported. I've removed those and added support for _all_ of the token types (even `mode/python` generates more than are currently being handled) by defaulting to the `codemirror.css` values, while the `_refs` file lets me treat `codemirror.css` as a library of LESS mixins instead of importing and including it..\n\nAlso, there is that bug of returning [`CodeMirror.modes.mode`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/html/static/base/js/utils.js#L568). Luckily, nothing relies on the output of `requireCodemirrorMode`.\n"
