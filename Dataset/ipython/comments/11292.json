    "body": "Hi @ivanov , thanks for your replay. I think `IPython.embed_kernel() ` does the same things as my script. I figured out having a constant connection file name using app.connection_file = . I really wanted to have the Ctrl+Space shortcut for code completion which I had made working in IPython. After some digging, it seems like that jupyter console using ZMQT related thing to handle the shell and IPython has its own interactive shell implementation which has support for customized shortcut in shell (e.g. ` ip = get_ipython(); bind_key = ip.pt_cli.application.key_bindings_registry.add_binding`) won't work under the jupyter console. Nonetheless, it's really nice to be able to prototyping gdb python scripts under IPython."
