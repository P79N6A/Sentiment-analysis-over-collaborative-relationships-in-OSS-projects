    "body": "PNG is also generally more predictable - SVG renderers in browsers are definitely better than Qt's (which is quite bad), but they are not perfect, nor are they reliably identical to each other.\n\nThere is also the option of sending multiple versions at the same time. This is obviously duplication of data, and increased network traffic, but it would allow better embedding of figures, especially in the notebook, where the right answer could be any of PNG/PDF/SVG/etc. for export, while the display format should be something else.  This is already true for Qt, where PNG is _definitely_ the right display format, but having SVG around as well would mean that the XHTML export would still work.\n"

In fact, we'd like to go beyond plots and have something akin to Sage's `@interact` but with a model more closely based on Traits and our own display protocols.  But that's a larger job, so it's quite likely that someone will add as an intermediate step support for matplotlib pan/zoom interactivity and basic event handling, with a full architecture for arbitrary widgets in the future.\n"
