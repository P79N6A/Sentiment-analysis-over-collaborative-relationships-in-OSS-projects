    "body": "No, abspath is not necessary but I tend to do this because it works even if you live with evil functions which changes directory.  Also I don't have strong opinion about the naming so it is OK to rename it to `__directory__` (but I don't know if it is a good idea to define variable with double underscores which is not in some kind of spec).\n\nBTW, what is the policy for merging PRs?  Does it need more than two reviewers or one reviewer is fine?  I just quickly checked the wiki but there is not much info.  If one reviewer is fine I would just fix them right away, because this kind of stuff is mostly about preference and I think comitters preference must be weighted than mine.  But if more than two reviewers are needed, waiting for another comment is better because other reviewer might have different opinion.  I am just being lazy :)\n"
