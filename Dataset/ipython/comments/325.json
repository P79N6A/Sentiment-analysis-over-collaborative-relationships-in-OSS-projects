Because we don't want to (or have\nthe time to) fix those regressions, we feel it is better to remove it\noutright.

The idea will be:\n- 0.10.x -> old code, with twisted in  it\n- 0.8x -> new project layout, stabilisation of apis. Basically what we have now, once this pull request goes in and we merge newparallel and new config.\n- 0.9x -> api stable, shake out bugs for release\n- 1.0 -> once we're happy enough with the 0.9x series.\n\nHow does that sound?\n\nBrian, thanks a lot for doing this!  This is phenomenal :)\n"

    "body": "Sure, we can stick with 0.x if there are objections, it has the inertia, but I think we _are_ really thinking about 1.0.  Even if we are sticking to 0.11 with newparallel and config in April, and 0.12 with htmlnotebook very soon after, I think that 0.99 (or whatever we decide to call pre-1.0 preparation) would come immediately thereafter.  I expect (or at least hope) that this will happen in 2011.\n\nNew things IPython 1.0 will have, not in 0.10:\n- completely reorganized codebase (0.11)\n- no twisted (0.11)\n- newparallel (0.11)\n- new config (0.11)\n- display (0.11)\n- unicode (0.11)\n- qtconsole (0.11)\n- html notebook (0.12)\n- two-process 0MQ terminal (0.12?)\n  Anything else? Curses Terminal?\n\nI see two options here.  Either we consider 0.99.0 as the point where we don't mind breaking everything in preparation for 1.0 (what we are doing in 0.11), or we jump to 0.99 the instant we are 1.0 feature-complete (not bug-free, just having a releasable version of all new features), and consider it strictly stabilization and cleanup.  I like the former, because it better prepares users for the changes they will face in an update, but the latter makes sense too.  I don't think too many users would expect approximately zero API compatibility between 0.10 and 0.11.\n\nI checked matplotlib's history, and they had a 0.98.x series prior to 0.99.x.  I think this is better than 0.88, other than Fernando's comment that 0.88 is 0.11, but 8 times as awesome.\n\nOther options are: jump a short distance to 0.20, or say we are halfway there with 0.50.  If there's no consensus, let's stick to 0.11, but I would vote for approximately every other proposal so far before 0.11.\n"

Because we'll want to build the docs and push a build with this information immediately to the users, so people can start preparing for it (as well as announcing it quite loudly on the lists).\n\nIn fact, I'd suggest pinging the -dev and -user lists right away pointing to this pull request and indicating what's going on, so people can start preparing.  Because the moment it gets merged, anyone who was running from master with twisted code (and I'm sure there are people like that, for whom it was working with local clusters) are going to be in for a really rough ride...\n\nSo I think before actually pulling the trigger on this one, we really need to make an announcement on the lists, so people at least are given a warning.\n"

I don't want the docs to start falling badly behind...\n\nOnce these two minor things are in, go for it!  The tests look good.\n\nthanks!\n"
