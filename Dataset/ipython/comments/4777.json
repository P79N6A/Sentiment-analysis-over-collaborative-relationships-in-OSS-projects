    "body": "OK here is a description of the bug. It is unrelated to #4860.\n\nIf the completer is open and the `TAB` key is pressed again, this code path is triggered:\n\nhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/html/static/notebook/js/completer.js#L323\n\nThat passes the list of completions to the `shared_start` method, which tries to find a common starting string among the different `raw_results`. When `x.__dict__.__` is completed, `raw_results` contains the list of actions completions (`type=introspection`) as well as the entiry `__dict__` (`type=context`) which comes from the local cells context and `CodeMirror.contextHint()`.\n\nThe shared start of the actual completions (which begin with `x.__dict__`) and `__dict__` is the empty string, which is then inserted into the cell here:\n\nhttps://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/html/static/notebook/js/completer.js#L330\n\nI am going to assign this to @Carreau as I don't really know what is going on here. But questions:\n- What cases is `shared_start` meant to handle? Maybe provide some inline comments to describe what it is going. It looks like it is just meant to handle strings that begin with `%`. If so, let's make sure it is not called at other times.\n- The names of variables in this part of the code are very obscure (`sh`,`A`,`B`,`tem1`,`tem2`, etc.). Maybe rename everything with long, clear names.\n- I am not sure what pressing `TAB` in the middle of already tab completing is supposed to do. Can't we just remove all of this logic?\n- There is a constant defined here `10` with no indication of its significance: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/html/static/notebook/js/completer.js#L33\n"
