    "body": "You mean why not put it into the KernelManager itself?  Honestly not sure.\n Some of the reasons:\n- MKM almost always has an event loop running, whereas KM doesn't always\n- KM's don't always own their kernel, but MKMs do.\n\nBut there are reasons to include the logic in KM itself:\n- It allows different KMs to implement autorestart in different ways - and\n  MKM can still manage them all.\n- It makes it an internal detail of the KM implementation that others don't\n  have to worry about.\n\nThoughts?  It is easy to move this around at this point...\n\nOn Fri, Feb 1, 2013 at 11:20 AM, Min RK notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> why is the autorestart only for MKM?
