(Putting aside the problem on duplicated callbacks when the container is displayed multiple times which you don't address here). \n\nThere is a corner case in terms of efficiency. When transitioning from `children=[foo, bar, bar]` to `children = [foo, bar]`, all the views of `bar` get deleted even if the first one could be spared rather than deleted and re-created. \n\nIf you want to address this special case, one way to save deletions and creations, rather than using the `difference` function would be to create an array of the multiplicities of each model in the new list. (Delete `max(0, old_mult  - new_mul)` views, and create `max(new_mul - mold_mult, 0)` views. )\n"

I've been trying to get #5980 working and it's now kind-of working, so I'll take a break and look at this some more.\n\n> I just checked the bug on the master branch, and it appears that the example I gave is also broken on master. It appears that your change didn't make things any worse.\n\nI'll save that for another PR.  It sounds like it could be a little more complex than the issue I'd like to solve with this PR.\n\n> There is a corner case in terms of efficiency. When transitioning from children=[foo, bar, bar] to children = [foo, bar], all the views of bar get deleted even if the first one could be spared rather than deleted and re-created.\n\nIt's not supposed to behave like that.  If that's what it's really doing it's probable a bug in my code.\n\n> Another issue, which is also present in master, is that when updating the children list, the order is not respected.\n\nYeah.\n\n> Another minor issue is that ContainerView has a member children that is unused and remains an empty object {}, which a bit misleading.\n\nAh yeah, you told me about that on HipChat but it's good to have here in writing because I'd already forgotten.\n\nI will make some changes and post back.\n"

Originally the use case was for an IPython blocks type thing (that never was implemented) where many many little colored square divs, each individual container widgets, would be added and removed from the DOM fast enough to create animations.  I don't have a problem removing this method, and the differencer here.\n"
