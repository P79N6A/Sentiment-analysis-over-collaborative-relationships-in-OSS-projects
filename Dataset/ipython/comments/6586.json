I also created this page on the wiki, for referencing the various event types: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Dev:-Javascript-Events\n\nThere are still two cases that I want to test that I don't know how to, though:\n1. When the frontend `Kernel` object gets a status message saying that the kernel is restarting (i.e. it is \"autorestarting\")\n2. When the frontend `Kernel` object gets a status message saying that the kernel is dead\n\nIs there a way I can trigger the kernel to send these two types of messages, so I can test how the frontend handles them?\n"

    "body": "Hmm, yeah, I hadn't thought about that case. The reason why I close them is because otherwise the experience is kind of weird when the kernel dies and can't be restarted -- first it pops up the dialog saying \"the kernel has died and will restart automatically\" and then when it eventually gives up it shows another dialog saying \"the kernel has died and needs to be manually restarted\". If the first dialog isn't closed, then, the second one is shown behind the first one and they won't see it until they click ok on the first one. Additionally, the gray backdrop stacks, so the background gets darker for each additional dialog.\n\nMaybe it could be, only close dialogs that are kernel-related, and if there are other dialogs open, leave them be?\n"
