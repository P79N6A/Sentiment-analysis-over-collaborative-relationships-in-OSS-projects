    "body": "%run and %cd have special completers loaded from completerlib.  The bug was  a tiny one-liner in [completer.expand_user](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/12e906918e19feab3e02b34878738f1024780fa0/IPython/core/completer.py#L178), that makes an inappropriate call to `str.replace`, which doesn't take into account the fact that what it's replacing can occur more than once (e.g. it is '/' when expanding '~/', so the tilde_val is 'homeuser' instead of '/home/user'.  I fixed it by truncating the path by length, rather than using `str.replace`.\n"
