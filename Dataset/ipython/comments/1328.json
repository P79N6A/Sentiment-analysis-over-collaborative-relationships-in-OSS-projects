I keep getting redirected to their homepage every time I try to go to our Jenkins url.\n\nBTW, any particular reason you made this branch in origin and not in takluyver?  Normally we make branches in the main repo only when we need to all have write access to them, so typically just for long, complex problems.  If it was an accident, don't bother cleaning it up: I'm sure we'll want this merged, so we can just delete the branch from the repo when we're done.\n\nThe code looks good, but I suggest one change: let's make the option be called `--with-xml-coverage`.  Otherwise, this would shadow the already valid nose `--with-coverage` option, which can be used to provide quick and dirty console-based coverage reports.\n"

Testing on OS X gives us a wider base than another Debian-based Linux system. If not, we can still work something out - if we can get the Debian packaged version of Numpy installed on ShiningPanda, maybe your machine could test against the latest released versions Numpy/Matplotlib.\n\nWeekly testing would be fine. If you want to do nightly testing, I've got ShiningPanda set up to run at 9am UK time/10 am Western Europe/1am California, which I think should avoid most of our prime hacking time, at least until we get Chinese contributors.\n"
