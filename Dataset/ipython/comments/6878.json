I was looking into whether we could highlight the block as a whole, and concluded that there wasn't an easy way to achieve it.\n\nIt's also annoying that Pygments has an `ExtendedRegexLexer` which does allow this state to be stored externally without a monkeypatch - but only a handful of the lexers inherit from that, so there doesn't seem to be a practical way to use it as we want.\n"
