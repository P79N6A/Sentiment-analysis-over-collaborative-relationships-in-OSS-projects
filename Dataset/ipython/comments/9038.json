    "body": "Digging into the source code (version 4.0.1), we found no trace of variable `kernelManager.autorestart`. However, we found variable `KernelRestarter.restart_limit` (default = 5) which when set to `0` does what we want, that is prevent any automatic kernel restart. The curious thing is that this variable does not appear in the command line `--help-all` options. Is the `KernelRestarter` class not included in the automatic parameter discovery mechanism?\n\nSo I guess it's the documentation that has fallen behind the implementation? Can a developer confirm that this is the correct way to go (changing the `restart_limit`)?\n\nThanks.\n"

    "body": "1. autorestart is hardcoded on instantiation of KernelManagers in MultiKernelManager, which takes higher priority than config, which makes it impossible to configure. I don't think there is a reason for this.\n2. in the meantime, you are correct that setting `KernelRestarter.restart_limit = 0` does what you want, and is fine to set. The omission of KernelRestarter from the generated help is an oversight, but doesn't affect the fact that it can be configured, as you have found. Only that it's a lot more difficult to find that out.\n"
