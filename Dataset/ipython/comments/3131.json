    "body": "We should add a one-liner to the README, it would be:\n\n```\npip install tornado pyzmq jinja2 ipython\n```\n\nor just\n\n```\npip install ipython[notebook]\n```\n\nfor the same thing.  To do the same thing from local git would be\n\n```\npip install -e .[notebook]\n```\n\nThe main issue is that these are all _optional_ dependencies (called 'extras' in setuptools) - core IPython itself has zero dependencies, that's why `pip install ipython` doesn't pull anything in, and why it shouldn't.\n\n(Note that `easy_install` is generally preferable for pyzmq on Windows and OS X, because pip frustratingly ignores eggs. Maybe someday wheel will address this.)\n"

    "body": "Thanks for the _optional dependencies_ hint - just what I was looking for.\n\nYou can take a look at my pull request, see if it fits. I didn't list the dependencies explicitly to minimize the number of edits necessary in case they change. I think the `pip install -e .[notebook]` method is the cleanest.\n\nBTW, I successfully  installed pyzmq using `pip` on both OS X and Ubuntu today. Maybe it started working on Windows as well.\n"
