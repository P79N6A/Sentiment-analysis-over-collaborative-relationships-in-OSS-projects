It should indeed be quite a straightforward merge.\n\nYou can give trunk a clean merge if you rebase your branch onto master, and handle the conflict there.\n\nDoes this specifically link %exit to the requesting frontend's closeEvent, is that how it works? Or are there other things happening as well?\n\nThanks for this!\n"
