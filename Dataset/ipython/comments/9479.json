If you are too much fine grained you have the risk of people not knowing exactly which dev version is using... even more, one user install a dev1 option and 10 min later another user install a dev2... if some bug was introduced, then both versions have the issue and since you are too grained, you could eventually been looking into the incorrect version, I mean, assuming the issue was because something introduced in dev2 whereas it was introduced in dev1...\nThe opposite works as well, if you are low grained, then you accumulate a lot of potential bugs in one common version... but I guess if I have to choose a compromise I would run with a daily-based devel release process...\nAnd for the \"every commit thing\", as @takluyver mentioned, in this case (not the notebook one), a quick pip install dev version should be enough...\n"
