    "body": "> What surprises me is that the LazyEvaluator was removed from ipykernel before @takluyver removed the PromptManager class from ipython.\r\n\r\nIn master, yes, but not in a release. ipykernel 4.4 was released in August. In general, master of every individual IPython or Jupyter package should work with the *stable* version of everything else unless something has gone wrong. Beyond that, every breaking change should really solve a problem. I don't think cleaning up is a good enough reason to break compatibility in general, but we've done two releases of ipykernel that will work, and IPython 6 is still some time off, so I think this is probably okay."
