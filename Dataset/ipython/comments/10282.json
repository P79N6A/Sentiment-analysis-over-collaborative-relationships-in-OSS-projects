If you read [reflexion on trusting trust](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf)  you'll figure out how we did it, and why you never find the reason. \r\n\r\nWithout joking the first column in Jedi, the second is IPython. Fixing the bug is not that hard, it's just that \"visually\" the completion are identical, under the hood they are not. you press tab several time to highlight some of them you will see the first column should show the types. The second is that under the hood. `it.accumulate` is \"Instert `.accumulate` at index 3.\" for left column for right one: \"replace text from 0 to 2 by `it.accumulate`.\"\r\n\r\nThere is even a comment in the code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        # Possible Improvements / Known limitation\r\n        ##########################################\r\n        # Completions may be identical even if they have different ranges and\r\n        # text. For example:\r\n        # >>> a=1\r\n        # >>> a.<tab>\r\n        # May returns:\r\n        #  - `a.real` from 0 to 2\r\n        #  - `.real` from 1 to 2\r\n        # the current code does not (yet) check for such equivalence\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll push an ugly 2 lines fix.\r\n\r\nYou will still see duplicate now and then, in particular `from foo imp<tab>` has 2 completion with and without trailing space.

I don't think there's any rush to fix this quickly, I wasn't really complaining :)  I just wanted to report it in case it wasn't flagged (I didn't see it open), if nothing else for folks that may be following master and be surprised.  As long as the issue is here open and explained, it's perfectly OK if a clean fix takes a bit of time.\r\n\r\nThanks though!  I know the Jedi support has been hard work, much appreciated."
