    "body": "The shim is a tiny bit more complicated now, since it's not just moving `IPython.frontend.*` to `IPython.*` anymore, as `IPython.frontend.html.notebook` became just `IPython.html`.  A result of the extra shim is that there is  one old import that doesn't work:\n\n```\nfrom IPython.frontend.html import notebook\n```\n\nbut\n\n```\nfrom IPython.frontend.html.notebook[.submod] import whatever\n```\n\nworks just fine. \n\nIt seems to be an artifact of `sys.modules['IPython.frontend.html.notebook']` already existing as a module, but not being a submodule of what `IPython.frontend.html` would point to.\n"
