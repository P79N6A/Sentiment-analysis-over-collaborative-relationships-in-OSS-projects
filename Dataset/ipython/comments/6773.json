I have two projects that are relevant here:\n- [nbopen](https://github.com/takluyver/nbopen) - open a notebook from the command line or file manager, reusing an available notebook server if possible.\n- [nbmanager](https://github.com/takluyver/nbmanager) - view running notebook servers and shut them down conveniently.\n\nFeel free to come and talk to me on either of those repos if you're interested in doing more with them.\n"
