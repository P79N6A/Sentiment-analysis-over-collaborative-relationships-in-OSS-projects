While convenient there, for quick and short releases, in IPython I think we're better off just rebuilding the -dev docs by default, and calling the script manually for a release build.  In the case of a release, it's no big burden to add manually the extra link.\n\nThis would simplify both the code and the usage, since the index.rst page would be fully manually edited, and the script would be limited to one of two actions:\n1. Buidling dev/, default action.\n2. Building an explicit tag (such as for a release).\n\nAnyone wanting to have a stab at it, go for it :)\n"

    "body": "I had been thinking of manually specifying the tag in the Makefile, but I will use your dev default, so it can still be used to build other releases from the Makefile without directly calling gh-pages.py.\n\nThe note was already in error, because it wasn't possible to create a duplicate release line if you used the correct makefile command (currently 'gh-pages-current', but will be 'gh-pages' after the fix) for the dev docs. I will update the doc page to match. \n\nThanks for the note.\n"
