    "body": "Typically, just setting `c.HubFactory.ip = '*'` in `ipcontroller_config.py` is sufficient. But this relies on\n\n``` python\nIn [1]: from IPython.utils.localinterfaces import public_ips\n\nIn [2]: public_ips()[0]\nOut[2]: '10.0.1.14'\n```\n\nreturning an IP address visible from the engines. If it doesn't you will have to set `c.HubFactory.location` manually to an appropriate value. Since the config files are Python, you can put your own logic to discover the address, e.g. \n\n``` python\neth1 = netifaces.ifaddresses('eth1')\nc.HubFactory.location = eth1[netifaces.AF_INET][0]['addr'] \n```\n"
