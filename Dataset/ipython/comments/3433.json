    "body": "For the record, I'm puzzled as to why there was a problem. 2.x shouldn't need this, and 3.x should get it fixed automatically by 2to3. Can 2.7 be forced to use the equivalent of `__future__.absolute_imports` for every module?\n\nAnyway, there should be no harm in this - explicit relative imports were added in 2.5. So I'll merge it.\n\n@codebraker thanks for the contribution, I hope it's the first of many\n"
