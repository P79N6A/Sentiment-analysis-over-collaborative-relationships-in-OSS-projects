    "body": "I think it will be great that we can use the \"max-height\" CSS property.  Namely, by default, if the output is less then some per-specified height, it outputs as usual. If it is more than then \"max-height\", we use the scroll bar. The output cell will never be more than the max-height.  I tried to modify some the CSS  to test it out, but I can not get it working properly on Firefox but the max-height behavior is correct in Safari. I think it is a bug in Firefox CSS implementation. One way to workaround that is to use something like @minrk's patch, using javascript to manipulate the height CSS property directly. \n"

First of all, it works mostly, i.e. the output is limited to 27 rows of print-output and I can scroll up and down using my MBP touchpad.\n\nWhat’s not so nice is that there is no indicator of the existence of elided output at all, since Lion only displays the scrollbar during active scrolling (actually, even then only the moving part of it).  IMO that should be addressed before the merge.\n"
