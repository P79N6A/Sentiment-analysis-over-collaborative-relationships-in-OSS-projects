    "body": "Looks fine to me, will fix things for those that are doing setups with proxies. Agree on the backport.\n\nHypothetically, what would be the attack surface for exploiting different protocols? You would need another service running on HTTP from the same host to exploit this, which would likely only be relevant in a scenario where\n- There are multiple users who cannot access each others data and service (if they have access or root access, they don't need this convoluted route)\n- Arbitrary users can host services on port 80 (think multi-tenant PHP via Apache)\n\nThen a local user could run code on port 80 to attack those running a service on 443. You'd think by that point though that they could also be hosting on 443. I got nothing else, but we can think on it.\n"
