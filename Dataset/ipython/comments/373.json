    "body": "go for buffer removal, if it's safe.\n\nBasically, when I wrote inputsplitter and built the new machinery, I was a bit afraid of tearing down everything at the same time: if something went badly wrong with the new system, I wanted to have an easy way to back off (without full version control reverts), so I left all the dead code around.  And just hadn't gotten around to removing it...\n\nSo aggressive removal of anything there that seems unused is ok.  However, in addition to  running the test suite, also do a little bit of old-style manual interactive  testing just for extra safety: type a few lines, indented stuff, magics, etc... Write out a little file you can paste from to make life easier if you want...\n\nBut it will be great to get rid of this old code, so we can actually see our new  shiny building :) Thanks!\n"
