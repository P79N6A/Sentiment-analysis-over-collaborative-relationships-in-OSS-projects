    "body": "@paykroyd, the changes look good, but I'm struggling to make it work easily and fully with python-mode-6.0.4.  Bear with me, I'm pretty ignorant of elisp... :)\n\n# problem 1\n\nI can get it to load ipython instead of python with `C-c C-!`, _but_ only if I put\n\n```\n(setq py-shell-name \"ipython\")\n```\n\n_before_ python-mode is loaded at all, by anything.  It means it took quite a bit of trial and error moving this line around in my config files; ultimately I stuck it just at the very beginning of my file.  This didn't use to be the case long ago, one could just\n\n```\n(require 'ipython)\n```\n\nand everything would work.  It would be nice to understand what's going on here, so we can give users some guidance.  \n\n# problem 2\n\nAll my attempts at configuring the arguments, to load with pylab mode active, failed.  I put\n\n```\n(setq py-python-command-args '(\"--pylab\" \"--colors\" \"LightBG\"))\n```\n\neverywhere in my emacs init files, from the start to the end, and no matter what I do, the value of that variable is reported as just `-i`.  Furthermore, I see there's code in ipython.el to auto-detect the color scheme and set `--colors``appropriately, but it doesn't seem to be working, because the variable`py-python-command-args` is also not being set automatically (I tested by _not_ setting it myself, and nothing happened).\n\nI temporarily disabled _all_ other python-related files, and tested that the codepath for auto-detection of the background _is_ being taken.  In fact, `py-python-command-args` is `(--colors=LightBG -i)` as I verified with a print statement in the elisp.  But strangely, once the emacs session starts, it's back to being only `-i`, so something is overwriting it later...\n\nThe only way I could make it work was by setting it interactively with `M-x set-variable`.  I went as far as completely nuking (temporarily) my entire emacs configuration, leaving a bare .emacs file with nothing but this:\n\n```\n(add-to-list 'load-path \"/home/fperez/.emacs.conf.d/lisp\")\n(add-to-list 'load-path \"/home/fperez/.emacs.conf.d/lisp/python-mode\")\n(setq py-shell-name \"ipython\")\n(require 'ipython)\n(setq py-python-command-args '(\"--colors\" \"LightBG\"))\n```\n\nand this did make ipython start, but still the colors didn't work right.\n\nSo we seem to have a problem where the order of loading of the files is getting things rewritten, no idea why.\n\nIn any case, if you can point me to a bare `.emacs` file with the minimum amount that makes it work, and I can reproduce it, I'd be thrilled to add these fixes.  But today I've already spent ~4 hours fighting with emacs and getting nowhere...  I hope we can find a solution for this, and really appreciate your help.\n"
