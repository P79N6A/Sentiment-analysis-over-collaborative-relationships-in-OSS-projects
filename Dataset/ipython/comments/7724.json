    "body": "@rsmith31415 it's a bug because the inner_cell shouldn't be overflowing at all. The inner CodeMirror element should be the one fixing its width and scrolling, which it does on other browsers (it can also be backward - maybe we are relying on buggy behavior in other browsers, where FF is the only one doing it right). It probably makes sense to set `overflow-x` to `hidden` or `auto` on div.inner_cell as a workaround. It doesn't fix the behavior, since it's still wrong (scrolling the wrong element), but it's a reasonable mitigation.\n"

    "body": "@minrk Certainly this shouldn't be happening. I think Firefox is causing the issue and maybe CodeMirror is not helping by changing things on the fly. It would be nice to isolate this issue in a simple example (without CodeMirror) to understand better what is happening. Keep in mind that  `overflow: auto;` depends on the user agent according to Mozilla's [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow), so we have to careful there.\n\n@takluyver I think it is better if you or minrk make a pull request for this since you guys have a much better understanding of the code base and this can be tricky.\n\nDoes anyone is able to test this workaround on Windows? \n\nBy the way, I just noticed you don't support IE (that is a relief).\n"
