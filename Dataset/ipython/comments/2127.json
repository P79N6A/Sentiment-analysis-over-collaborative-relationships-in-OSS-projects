Removing the `btn-small` class helps a lot.  I think there was, and will continue to be, confusion between the \"move cell up/down\" and \"insert cell up/down\" buttons.  Looking through Font Awesome, the most similar to the previous icons are `icon-upload-alt` and `icon-download-alt`, but it's not clear to me that they are any more obvious.\n\nThe play icon has bugged me for a while, I think it should be a \"step-foward\" button to indicate that it just runs one cell and advances to the next cell.\n"

A few things to keep in mind:\n- I am +1 on moving to bootstrap, but let's do that in a separate PR.\n- In general, I am trying to keep as much of our page structure in the HTML template as possible.  IOW, I want most of the DOM to be created in HTML, not dynamically in JS.  That is why I have been a bit hesitant on this one.  But I understand we do need this to be resuable, so I am OK with this being in JS.  But please keep this in mind in other development work.\n\nGreat work!\n"
