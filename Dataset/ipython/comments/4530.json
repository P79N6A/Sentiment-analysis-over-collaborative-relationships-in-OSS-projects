    "body": "You need to be slightly more specific in what you describe. \n\nBut if I understand you request either :\n- You are not understanding the difference between Python/IPython and the SciPy Stack. If you are interested in multi-dimensional data array, you could have a look at numpy, pandas and scikit-ndimages. etc.\n- Or, If I look at the other identical question you ask on other project, I suppose you are speaking of graphical user-interface, then no, it is not on the roadmap but could be written as a plugin. Be warned though, even if it **looks** nice, above 3D and a certain amount of number, spreadsheets are useless and slow.\n\nAlso you seem to try to make many project collaborate with each other, which is appreciated, but be careful, some person takes those messages as a request to cease to exist and could react in a bad way.\nAlso, just to warn you;  usually merging project has a huge cost, and even if we are happy to de-duplicate functionality sometime the energy barriere is too high, and is help full to have someone supervising the merge that just letting devs discussed with each other \n"

    "body": "Main advantage is easy data storage, pivots, data flow computing and charts. Dataflow aspect of spreadsheets make it very useful. That is why I thought it might be useful to include.\n\nOf course Excel style spreadsheets have lof of flaws. But there are other / better models. E.g Javeline and the other examples above.\n\nIt will be good to see such functionality if you decide to include it as Shreadsheets are still be best computable documents arround.\n\nAlso perhaps you can get some ideas from Org Mode also.\n"

But they both take quite different and complementary approaches. I don't think there is much scope for combining the two. If you think you have an idea for doing so, I encourage you to pursue it in an external project and keep in touch on the IPython mailing list. I don't think this is a productive just as a feature request for the core IPython team, though.\n"
