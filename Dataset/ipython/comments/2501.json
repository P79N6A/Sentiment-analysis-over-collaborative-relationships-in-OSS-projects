    "body": "Hi Brian, here is what I mean:\n\nI use IPython notebook on my laptop. I create a notebook, with some calculations. Now I would like to send a link to it to my colleague. So I click File->Export->download as ipynb. Using your and @Carreau's comments I realized that I can just as well find the ipynb on my filesystem in git. Either way, I have to open it in gedit or some other editor that allows me to copy the whole file to clipboard. Then I paste it into a gist. Finally, once it is in gist, I go to the nbviewer.ipython.org and paste the gist url. At the end, I ended up with this:\n\nhttp://nbviewer.ipython.org/3912958/\n\nand I am very happy with the result. My idea for huge improvement would be to only click a button in the notebook (that runs on my laptop _locally_), and it would publish it to gist and automatically load it in nbviewer.\n\n@Carreau, I like your ideas about git. But as the first step, it can simply create a gist automatically, and simply keep updating the same gist. Github should automatically version it. If this is too complex at first, let's just create a new gist with each click on \"Publish\". That should be easy and ipython doesn't need to keep track of anything.\n\nLet me know if I made myself clear.\n"
