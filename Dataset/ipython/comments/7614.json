    "body": "Hi @Carreau,\n\nYes, I've seen Facebook Lua kernel, it looks great. We can't use it because in https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash we're using Lua scripts to control PyQt4.QtWebKit.QWebView - most code is in Python (yeah, that's complicated; there is also Twisted event loop involved). In addition to that, iTorch uses LuaJIT while Splash uses Lua 5.2; they are not compatible. But we'll probably borrow some code (a completer?).\n\nOnce I finish the IPython integration I'll add a link to the wiki, thanks for the suggestion.\n"
