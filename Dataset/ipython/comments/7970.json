Wouldn't it be more correct to copy these issues over to the notebook repo?\r\n\r\nYes, though there is a large number of opened issues and some of them are duplicates. So while it would be nice I think the number of issues that would need to be migrated is small. It's also uncertain wether this should be notebook or lab or something else.\r\n\r\nThe migration bot is also broken – I should work on that, and a close issue can still be migrated reopened. So Far IPython was above 1k opened issue and having an open issue here let people believe it would worked on while the people mostly involved in notebook/lab do not look at issues here so leaving open is that wrong kind of signal."
