    "body": "Rather than coming from the running kernel, perhaps it should come from the profile. Pros:\n- if the kernel has any problem, you still get info\n- you get the info fast (some kernels may take a bit longer than Python to get started)  \n- you can get the info when the kernel isn't running\n\nCons:\n- it could be wrong, out of sync with kernel\n"
