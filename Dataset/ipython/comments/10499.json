    "body": "#514 was closed, perhaps over-eagerly, when we were separating repos into different pieces. This is a limitation of the Jupyter architecture as a whole, not specific to the IPython kernel.\r\n\r\nThe 'stdin' referred to in #3089 is a little bit of a misnomer. The Jupyter protocol allows the kernel to get a line of user input from the frontend, but this is designed around the paradigm of an explicit request for input (like Python's `input()` function), not the stdin paradigm of a pipe which you can put data into at any time.\r\n\r\nThe root of the difficulty with subprocesses is that there's no way (AFAIK) to tell when one is waiting for input - it doesn't have any way to signal to its parent process or the terminal 'you need to send me a line now'.\r\n\r\nNow that we ship a terminal emulator in the notebook, one thing we could look at is providing a way to launch a command in a terminal from a notebook cell, and display an interactive terminal as part of the output of the cell."

    "body": "This seems related to another common problem: debugging a cell with `%pdb on`, then forgetting to quit before changing the cell and re-running it.  The output the disappears, so you can't hit \"q\" any more to quit, and interrupting the kernel doesn't help.  You have to restart the kernel.  See e.g.  https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/3400 which remains open, but which seems different, since it isn't clear to me that pdb runs a separate sub-process.\r\nIf there was a way to run `pdb` on the notebook in  a terminal emulator, that would be handy."
