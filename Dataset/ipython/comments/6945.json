    "body": "This is related to #6850.\n\nThis fixes the loading, but I think we should think a bit more clearly about part this part of the language_info changes.\n\nIn v3, we have:\n\n```\nnotebook.metadata.language\n```\n\nIn kernel_info, we now have:\n\n``` python\n{\n  \"language\": str, # in all msgspec versions\n  \"language_info\": { # new in v5 messages\n    \"codemirror_mode\": \"etc.\",\n  },\n}\n```\n\nAnd right now, we are _moving_ kernel_info.language into metadata.language_info, which is otherwise a direct copy of kernel_info.language_info.  I don't think we should have that mismatch between kernel_info.language_info and metadata.langauge_info. We should either:\n1. keep 'language' at top-level, and only use language_info for extra information like mimetype, cm mode, etc., or\n2. move language into language_info.name in kernel_info_reply.\n\nI am somewhat inclined to prefer 1.\n"
