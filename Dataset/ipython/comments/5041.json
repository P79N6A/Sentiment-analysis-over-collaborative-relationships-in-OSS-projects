    "body": "I think this is a bit overzealous, and we need to be clearer about when and why `.html` is unsafe.  Often, it is perfectly safe, and the right thing to use.  `.html` is safe when:\n- it is a simple literal\n- we control what goes into the call\n- html is escaped\n\nBecause of this, the 'CAUTION' warnings on every `.html` call are much too enthusiastic. A simple comment about why each call is reasonable should be sufficient, and when it's just a literal, a comment even seems unnecessary because it is obviously perfectly fine.\n"
