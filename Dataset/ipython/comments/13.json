    "body": "[ LP comment 1 by: Fernando Perez, on 2010-01-18 01:39:06.370752+00:00 ]\n\nSome notes on the above:\n- I talked with William Stein (sage) a few days ago: no major progress from them on using pexpect for windows, instead they are moving away from pexpect as much as possible by building library wrappers for everything they can (like maxima and gap).\n- I don't see us abandoning nose anytime soon.  Trial has a few critical problems:\n- it would make testing depend on twisted for us.  Nose is a tiny, self-contained download, but Twisted is a much larger dependency.  Too much for something as critical as testing.\n- It has no discovery mechanism for doctests.\n- My earlier efforts on doing ipython doctests without nose were only partly successful.  In the last few weeks that I've been working a lot on this, I realized we really need quite a bit of machinery to be able to validate full ipython sessions, just doing syntax conversion to get a unittest out of a docstring (the part I was able to succeed on) isn't sufficient for the whole test suite.\n\nI don't think it's really possible to expect our test suite to pass without an ipython shell running somewhere.  We are more than just plain python, and to test all of that we really need a true ipython somewhere that we can beat on.\n\nHaving said all this, I think things now aren't really that bad.  Having cleaned up the test machinery a lot recently, it's working quite well, debugging is possible with --pdb or other mechanisms, etc.  The only thing that is hard is debugging a big doctest with lots of output, but that's simply how doctests are, not something specific to ipython (and for that reason, a bad idea in general if you want your tests to be debuggable).\n\nI'm all for making our testing machinery as simple/robust as humanly possible, because I fully realize the importance of the test support in the health of a project.  But having spent literally upwards of a hundred hours on this problem alone, I'm not sure right now I'm capable of making it much simpler without writing something like nose again, from scratch.\n\nOne ray of light may come from python itself: I think for 2.7 they are improving unittest, so perhaps we could find better support there once it's out.  \n\nI'm open to revisiting this question when possible, but I'm not terribly optimistic on _me_ making lots of improvements beyond what's right now in my trunk-dev branch (which actually works quite well, it must be said).  But I'd love to see someone who comes with a fresh eye on this problem make progress on it!\n"

Over-generic issues without a concrete metric for success are in practice more or less noise in the tracker, as they can never be truly satisfied.\n\nIf anyone wants to reopen this, please do so with _specific_ information on what needs to be done to consider it fixed.
