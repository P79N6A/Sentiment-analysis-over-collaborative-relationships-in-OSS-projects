All the people installing IPython releases through conda, pip, distro packaging tools, etc. will get dependencies automatically.\n\nEven for the people who do live on master, a. this only happens once every few months, it's not the end of the world, and b. those people can probably work out that `ImportError: no module named foo` means they need to go and install foo.\n"

Having said that, I think this approach of adding a simple explanatory statement (_without_ hiding the traceback or otherwise obscuring the problem, as @minrk  pointed out in his closed PR), is a good idea.  It's low cost, and if it helps us steer a few users every now and then away from a trap that may discourage them, all the better.\n\nThere's no such thing as \"too friendly/easy installation\", or at least we're still a galaxy away from that.\n"

We can't even tell if it's that import that failed, or something else that was imported by that module. If the user sees \"blah blah blah ImportError: foo ... IPython depends on the bar package, please install it first\", we're obscuring the real problem.\n\nI don't really think it's worth cluttering up every external import with a dozen extra lines of exception handling for a slightly better error message in a fairly rare case that we can't reliably detect anyway.

    "body": "As @minrk indicated, it's good to have the TB in case there's a nastier problem to debug. The point of the extra message is simply to provide a clear, unambiguous statement to the user: 'the above import error is really a core dependency you're missing, not some accidental  side-error, install the package to fix it'. It conveys _information_ to the user about a choice _we_ have made regarding package X being an actual core dependency.  The traceback is there in case additional debugging is needed, but in most cases those two lines will just get the user unstuck.\n\nGuys, I'm frankly a bit surprised at how much opposition you're raising for this fairly simple fix. This is three lines of help information with no real complexity, algorithmic cost, maintenance burden, etc. If they get a few users get unstuck, it's a good thing.\n\nI understand the need for solid review, but there's also death by a thousand nitpicks. Let's not devolve into that...\n"
