I'm on a really bad 3G connection here and v2 fails after 1 or 2 min. The master version is easily surviving 30min of inactivity. Maybe an hour.\n\nConnection drops or VPNs are still a problem. I see it's `Reconnecting websockets`, then new connections show up, but it's still not possible to run commands. I'll try to document this case a bit better.

How does it solve in production?\r\n\r\nSorry about that, this is a known limitation and we've been working on it. Unfortunately that requires changing bits of code in a backward compatible manner for things that are several years old, which is far from easy. \r\n\r\nIn general if you have a long running task you should try to save intermediate results; if you are running Python you should look into `Futures` to wrap your task. The task themselves will complete successfully, and the results will still be on the kernel side. You just need to redisplay them. Only the displaying part is necessary, not the computation. \r\n\r\nHope that will help."
