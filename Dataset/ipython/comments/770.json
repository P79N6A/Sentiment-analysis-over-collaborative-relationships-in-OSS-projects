Since the kernel can be started without there ever being a terminal associated with it (e.g. as a GUI script), it makes sense for there to be somewhere to store an encoding that should be used to interpret bytes.  I think there just isn't a reliable way for us to always get the right answer, and when that's the case, it makes sense to let advanced users make the choice.\n"

And it's reproducible all the way back to 0.11 release, so it has nothing to do with recent unicode fixes like I thought.\n\nThis is using PyQt4 (Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, qt4/pyqt4 from apt: PyQt4 4.7.2, Qt 4.6.2).\n\nAs we discussed on IRC, this only affects PyQt, and not PySide, and the reason it appears new is that your PySide is 1.0.0, and PR #725 made the minimum PySide version 1.0.3, effectively switching your default from PySide to PyQt.\n"

    "body": "I added debug statements to the frontend, and I can see the difference between the normal traceback sent, and the one that's drawn wrong: null characters.  Each triangle corresponds to a (\\x00) char that is somehow added to the color-code only in the source, and only from ipdb.\n\nRaising the error with `222/0`, the line in the traceback is:\n`\\x1b[0;32m----> 1\\x1b[0;31m \\x1b[0;36m222\\x1b[0m\\x1b[0;34m/\\x1b[0m\\x1b[0;36m0\\x1b[0m\\x1b[0;34m\\x1b[0m\\x1b[0m`\n\nWhereas the same line, colored by ipdb is:\n`\\x1b[0;32m     -1 \\x1b[0;31m\\x1b[0;36m2\\x1b[0m\\x1b[0;31m\\x00\\x1b[0m\\x1b[0;36m2\\x1b[0m\\x1b[0;31m\\x00\\x1b[0m\\x1b[0;36m2\\x1b[0m\\x1b[0;31m\\x00\\x1b[0m\\x1b[0;34m/\\x1b[0m\\x1b[0;31m\\x00\\x1b[0m\\x1b[0;36m0\\x1b[0m\\x1b[0;31m\\x00\\x1b[0m\\x1b[0;34m\\x1b[0m\\x1b[0m`\n\nIt would appear that PySide just ignores the `\\x00` null chars, whereas PyQt draws them as triangles.  You can see this by simply doing `print '\\x00'`. You will see a triangle with pyqt, and nothing in every other context I can find.\n\nSo this really seems like a bug in ipdb, just one that doesn't actually matter anywhere but in a pyqt-console.\n"
