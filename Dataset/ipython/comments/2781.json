    "body": "I also have this **critical** issue. It seems to be related to loops indeed. This prevents me from running long simulations or data analysis, which means: I'm screwed...\n\nI don't know if it's related but I noticed that once it hangs, the hyperthreading seems to collapse into one CPU still working. You can see that by using [htop](http://hisham.hm/htop/), for example. At first, it seemed to me that hyperthreading (which the numpy -> BLAS libraries are exploiting on my machine) was the one crashing and then the whole thing would run crazy slow, but then I tried to interrupt and had no luck and so I realized it was the IPython kernel just getting stuck.\n\nThis problem never occured me when:\n- I was using an older machine (but still very similar, just fewer RAM and CPUs)\n- I was using old ipython<3.0\n- I was not working on a remote IPython notebook\n\nMy educated guesses are:\n- issue with the some socket somewhere...\n- matplotlib threading backends are messing up <-- but that's just because they almost always do so better put there the bet ;)\n\nWhen the problem occurs, I just restart the kernel from within the web interface and re-do what I was doing...\n\nEDIT: it is hard for me as well to reproduce it but I noticed that if I don't use BLAS, for example if I don't use numpy's dot product, the problem doesn't appear, although I should run some more tests to verify that.\n"

I can get to the point where I click the interrupt kernel button and it highlights as if it was clicked, but something, somewhere doesn't receive the message to stop. \n\nMy initial impression is that it's a problem with chrome's text rendering engine, but I know little on how that works.\n\nAnother example of slowness is when a relatively large matplotlib comes to the foreground after scrolling to it. The entire notebook becomes extremely jittery for a good 4-5 seconds.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm using a fairly beefy machine, so it's especially weird that jupyter can bring my entire machine to its knees.\n\n9/10, it happens on accident, so it's not as easy as calling it a user error bug.\n"
