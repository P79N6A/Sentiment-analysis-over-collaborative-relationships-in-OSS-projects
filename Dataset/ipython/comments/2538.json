    "body": "Hi ! \n\nThanks for the PR ! \n\nMy personal opinion on this one would be to maybe have an explicit end of cell (for example an `%%end` cell magic). I don't have searched for argument for or against an implicit delimiter (`\\n\\n`) or an explicit delimiter though.\n\nI think we should think of how are handled nesteed magic.\nwould `%%timeit` wrapping `%%bash` require 4 newline ?\n\nAnd also how much user are used to skip line and will inadvertently break the cell.\n\nDoes `\\n\\n`have special meaning in other potential languages (LaTeX processing ? Coffeescript?)\n\nAlso, If we have a strict marker at the end, would it be possible to indent for readability ?\n\nThanks ! \n"

    "body": "Yeah, all of those are great points. These are definitely a few of the reasons why this requires some careful considerations by you guys. (\"\\n\\n\" is definitely important in LateX)\n\nI think a `%%end` magic would be appropriate, but that's a bit of a change to the \"ipython\" language. In a sense, `%%end` would not actually be a magic itself, but a symbol that is used to delimit magics.\n\nHaving the contents of cell magics be delimited via their indentation is another option, which is perhaps more \"pythonic\", but is different from how cell magics are currently used in the ipython notebook, which currently does zero processing of the contents of the magic. (If your magic is something like `%%R` or `%%bash` that doesn't care about leading spaces, then you can always indent if you like.)\n\nMy preference would be to use indentation to delimit cell magics I guess, but anything is fine.\n\nUsing indentation, we'd have something like\n\n``` python\n# test_indentation.ipy\n\nprint 'Hello World from python'\n%%timeit\n  %%bash\n    echo \"Hello World from bash\"\n\nprint 'Ending in python'\n```\n\nUsing an explicit %%end delimiter, we'd have something like\n\n``` python\n# test_end_delimiter.ipy\n\nprint 'Hello World from python'\n%%timeit\n%%bash\necho \"Hello World from bash\"\n%%end\n%%end\n\nprint 'Ending in python'\n```\n"
