I don't think a ConsoleWidget without history makes a great deal of sense.\n- Merge BaseFrontendMixin into FrontendWidget, the only class into which the mixin is mixed.\n- Merge RichIPythonWidget into IPythonWidget. A plain-text-only IPythonWidget doesn't make much sense.\n- Possibly merge FrontendWidget into IPythonWidget, depending on Enthought feedback about how useful a FrontendWidget is, without the IPython part.\n\nThat would bring the situation from 6 classes down to 3 or even 2, which I think would be a lot more manageable. One of the most confusing parts of working on the Qt code is the `super()` hierarchy of some methods, where 'simple' cases are handled in a parent class, but complex cases of the same event are defined in a child.\n"
