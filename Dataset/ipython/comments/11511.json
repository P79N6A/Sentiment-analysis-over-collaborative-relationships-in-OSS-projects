    "body": "Hi, \r\n\r\n> I'm a newcomer to python, ipython, etc... (migrating from matlab!)\r\n\r\nCongratulation ! it takes some time to get used to, but it's worth it. \r\n\r\nI think all the issues are link to the same root cause. It's on windows so i'm unsure exactly. \r\nBut likely when you start the notebook server with `jupyter notebook` , it is supposed to start in current working directory. It is lilkey that  it starts somewhere else. Like in `C:\\`, hence why you see all these files. \r\n\r\nEven if you are administrator, the notebook server is not and then can't write a file. .\r\n\r\nYou could try to run `jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=<path to where you want to start>`\r\n\r\nLet us know if that works. \r\n\r\nSide note this question may be better in https://github.com/jupyter/notebook \r\n\r\n"

I was expecting I would chose the working path once I was in the notebook.\r\n\r\nI didn't get form the youtube tutorial I should start from an empty folder, despite of it was there! \r\n\r\nI started from Windows 'start menu'  opening a command window with  \"cmd\", and Windows put me in the \"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\" folder... starting Jupyter Notebook from there, so the files in the dashboard was the content of this folder (so obvious now!). Windows doesn't allow me to create nothing there, even I'm the administrator, so the permission issue. Changing to other folders (non-system ones), all runs nicely. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
