    "body": "Ok, got a way to get around that, but it is not easy if we don't want to add python assumption in it. \n\nThe issue is that \"tab\" has been weaponize and that we need to \"guess\" wether one want to complete or tooltip. \nRight now if the cursor is preceded by space or '(' we invoke tooltip.\n\n `foo( param1, <tab>` will get help on `foo(` \n\nOtherwise, completer is invoked.\n\nI can special case `import <tab>` to complete, but it is python specific. \nYou could also  in `custom.js` set `IPython.config.tooltip_on_tab = false` and use `Shit-Tab` to trigger tooltip (this should also work if you select text and press shift tab, it will trigger help on selection).\n\nIn any case, I'm not sure there is a really perfect way to deal with that. But we might have to in any case separate complete from tooltip as language like julia will more likely need more complex heuristic in the kernel where we cannot decide on frontend what to do.\n"
