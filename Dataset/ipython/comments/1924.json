    "body": "I believe the philosophy behind CSS resets is that they take out almost all of the browser's defaults and then put them back in manually, so that the web application doesn't fall prey to unexpected, undesired defaults in certain browsers. It's not _that_ wrong-headed to choose whitelisting over blacklisting... but I guess it destroys some useful and probably-universal defaults as well. There's [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/), which tries to preserve said defaults.\n"
