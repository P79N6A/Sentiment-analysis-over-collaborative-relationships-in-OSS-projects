    "body": "To unpack that a bit:\r\n\r\n- You don't see source because `Exception` is implemented in C, not in Python. We can only find and display source for objects implemented in Python.\r\n- The `?` introspection works on names and attributes but not on calls, so you can do `Exception.__init__??` but not `Exception.__init__()??`\r\n- You don't see any docstring for `Exception.__init__` because it doesn't have one (technically, it does: it gets the base docstring from `object.__init__` by default, but that's so generic it's not really useful, so we don't show it)\r\n- I have no idea what `??Exception.__init__(Exception.__new__(Exception))` is about :-P"
