We don't want the case\n\n%edit filename.py\n\nto dump the entire contents of filename.py into the history!\n\nBut for input lines it does seem like a better implementation than what we have right now.\n"

    "body": "This would be tricky with our current design: we store the input before we attempt to run it. Three ways we could get round it:\n- Special case `edit` in the input logic, so that you actually do the editing as part of the input translation. Doesn't sit well with our current design.\n- Not record input until after execution, so we can change what we store. But part of the motivation for the current system was that the input should be recorded even if it crashes IPython.\n- Add messy code to update stored input after execution.\n\nAs you may have guessed, I don't much like any of those options. There's also the wider question of whether history should be a record of what's executed, or of what's entered. Finally, if you want to edit and rerun a line from history, you can use the `%rep` (aka `%recall`) magic to place it at the next prompt.\n"
