    "body": "see http://codemirror.net/doc/upgrade_v4.html and http://codemirror.net/doc/upgrade_v3.html  onKeyEvent have been dropped, codecell has been upgraded but not TextCell (textcell.js:44-46). \n\nIt actually happend in the following case: \n- Current cell is text cell \n- cursor is on second line and would go on first line char 0 if you were to press up.\n- or Last-1 line and woudl go on last line char zero if pressing down.\n\nCell.js:190-216 is patched, codecell uses codemirror.on(...) textcell still use onKeyEvent map. \n\nShould be a (relatively) easy fix by duplication the codecell,js:~143 logic and/or moving logic in common place.\n\nI there is a ipython sprint in 2 weeks in london, I'll mark it as sprint-friendly and try not to fix it unless it becomes too annoying.\n"
