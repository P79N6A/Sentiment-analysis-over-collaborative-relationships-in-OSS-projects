The run_cell method is invoked so all of the interactive shell rules apply.  \r\n\r\nThe current way of running notebooks is using `nbconvert` with the `--execute` flag.  The [__runipy__](https://github.com/paulgb/runipy) project is deprecated, and recommends the `nbconvert` approach.  Some other ways to acheive a similar result is with [__importnb__](https://github.com/deathbeds/importnb) or [__papermill__](https://github.com/nteract/papermill/)."
