    "body": "OK I finally had a chance to look at this.\n1. The two methods where renaming collisions can happen are `save_notebook` and `save_new_notebook`.  Both are in the base notebook manager class and call `write_notebook_object` for their work.  Currently, `write_notebook_object` returns the `notebook_id`.  We need to modify this to return a JSON structure that includes the notebook_id, but also information about the state of the save when it fails:\n\nOn success: status code 200 and return JSON:  `{'notebook_id': 1232342432}`\nOn save error: status code 400 and return JSON: `{'message': 'Filename already exists'}`\n\nYou have to go through and make sure the everywhere the server returns data to the client using the notebook id, we send back JSON.\n1. After thinking further, I don't think we should allow the replacement action on the server.  It is too destructive and I think we should force users to delete the original file and then perform the rename.\n"
