    "body": "Lots of the Twisted-based parallel code is broken in 0.11, and will not be fixed. It is to be deprecated, and possibly removed before 0.11 release, in favor of the new ZeroMQ based parallel code, currently found in my newparallel branch:\nhttp://github.com/minrk/ipython\n\nIf you want to use the Twisted parallel code, you should use 0.10.\n\nUnfortunately, at this point there are several key things missing from the new parallel code, including the more sophisticated ipcluster scripts and the magics.\n"
