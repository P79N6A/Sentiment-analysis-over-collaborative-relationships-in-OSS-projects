    "body": "Hi @rossant ,\n\nI don't think this is a problem with the widgets.  Instead its an intentional behavior of browsers with canvas elements.  I've whipped up a [jsfiddle illustrating the behavior](http://jsfiddle.net/2tQxV/1/).  All you need to do is set the tabindex of the canvas so the browser knows it can accept input.  \n\nAdding something like this \n\n``` javascript\n    .attr('tabindex', '1')\n```\n\nto the jquery commands that create your canvas should do the trick.  Can you try this and report back?\n"

    "body": "> It's not specific to <canvas/>, is it?\n\nNo problem, glad I could help!\n\nI think most elements default to _not_ having a tab index.  Some elements, like text boxes, buttons, and other user input controls do get tab indicies assigned to them by the browser.  \n\nContrary to my jsfiddle, you should set your tabindex to 0 if you want the element to be focusable and want the browser to assign an appropriate tab index.  IIRC -1 means not focusable and any other positive integer gives it a specific index (which requires you to know the surround indicies if you want to assign it correctly).  ref: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4112289/what-is-the-html-tabindex-attribute\n\nI'll go ahead an close this then.\n"
