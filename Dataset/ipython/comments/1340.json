You could programmatically build the notebook with that input cell, execute it to get the output cell, then collapse it, then launch the browser page. \n\nIn the widget example, it means I could \"script\" a web app from Python by writing some code to generate an interactive plot. Then when I launch it, the _only_ thing that appears is that plot itself (no input cell) yet it can still be controlled via the widgets.\n\nThis would be a great feature, and it needs to be part of the live notebook proper, not converted notebooks, since it is still about executing live code (in my example, through the widgets).\n"

    "body": "@ellisonbg  You wrote \"We have decided to not implement this feature in the live notebook itself. It will be present in nbconvert and possibly in nbviewer though, where viewing is more the purpose. We will however be adding the ability to collapse/show full cells and sections of notebooks in the liv\"  \n\nWhy is this?  I feel this is looking at iPython vs nbconvert through a narrow lens. If you look at iPython as a place to do work, there are many cases where you want to put some code in, maybe only show 1 line (the top line so you have a reminder of what's there) and then collapse the rest.   Maybe you have a large text JSON file you want to push into a variable etc.   you can put it into your variable, execute the code, then collapse it so you can get on to the work of manipulating it.  This way the data is there, and anyone can open it back up, but now you are not scrolling through two pages of stuff to get to your \"work\"\n"
