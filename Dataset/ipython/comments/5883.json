    "body": "Sorry for the delay: I had to get back to the affected machine. The crash requires the IPython Notebook magic %matplotlib inline or %pylab inline. It doesn't happen in an IPyhton terminal window. \n\nTo reproduce it, I set up a new virtualenv with Python 2.7.6 and Matplotlib (+ dependencies) and IPython, pyzmq, Jinja2, tornado - just enough to run an IPython notebook. I have a different machine with 2.7.5 and otherwise identical package version where it doesn't happen.\n\nIf you could point me to where this issue should be filed if it isn't IPython I'd be grateful. Matplotlib? Python itself?\n\nThanks.\n"
