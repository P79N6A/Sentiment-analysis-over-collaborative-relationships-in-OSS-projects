    "body": "for now just listing here as a known issue - not sure what the way to go about handling this, since we won't expect to be able to ready the author's mind in general for the type of language they want to be using with the code blocks.\n\nSwitching to github-flavored markdown may help, for when the author wants to explicitly dictate the language for the codeblock.\n\nI was able to turn off the commenting in prettify to confirm that this was happening there. Look for the code starting with `cStyleComments&&` - which has the regex matching `//` - but changing that match stil makes `//` render funny.\n"
