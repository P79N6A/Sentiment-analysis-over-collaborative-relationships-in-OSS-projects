    "body": "This is just a matter of resolution.  You have a large 1200x1200 image with a one-pixel line down the middle, but the inline figure is only ~375 pixels square.  So the hairline is getting lost by the resolution reduction.\n\nIf you increase the figure size:\n\n```\nfigsize(10,10)\n```\n\nor decrease the resolution:\n\n```\nw, h = 600,600\n```\n\nor increase your line width, all of these will result in visible lines.\n\nOr, yet another approach, and perhaps most preferable: skip matplotlib's imshow, and display the image directly.\n\n[here](https://github.com/minrk/ipython_extensions/blob/master/pil_display.py) is an IPython extension that registers a default display formatter for PIL objects, so you can just display them without going through matplotlib.\n"
