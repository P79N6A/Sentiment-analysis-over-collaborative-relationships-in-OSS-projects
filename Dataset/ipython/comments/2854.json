This would be for the parts of the kernel at are zmq independent.  This would be for the base kernel implementation, kernelmanager, kernelmanagerabc, and your kernel utilities (maybe as IPython.kernel.launcher or utils?)\n- Consolidate the zmq kernel apps into a single module, possibly combining into one class, but minimally putting them in one file.\n\nI think this would provide a clean set of abstractions that better reflect how the code is organized.  I know this expands the work for this PR a bit more, but you are much of the way there...\n\nCheers,\n\nBrian\n"

A minority is directly for launching kernels, the rest is for dealing with connection files (locating them, writing them, etc.), and connecting to kernels (ssh tunnels, etc.).  In any case, I think the official API for these should be IPython.kernel, so the specific filename or number of files is not so important.\n"

    "body": "I should say - your argument does make sense, in that IPython.zmq contains 'our zmq-based IPython kernel', and these other things like KernelManager might belong somewhere else.  I just think 'IPython.kernel' isn't the right name for it, since there is something called the \"IPython kernel\" and IPython.kernel is strictly code that is _not_ that kernel.\n\nThere is one point though - if the zmq KernelManager belongs in this new package, but the zmq Kernel lives in IPython.zmq, that would suggest that the inprocess KernelManager and Kernel do not themselves belong together in the same subpackage, right?\n\nTo my mind, we have subpackages containing an _implementation_ of a Kernel (currently zmq and inprocess), and their unique peers (associated KernelManagers) are also defined adjacently.  Things that belong in IPython.kernel should be strictly reusable, which the zmq KernelManager certainly is not - it can only talk to kernels that talk the _wire_ protocol (distinct from the message protocol in general) as implemented in zmq.Session.  In this way, IPython.kernel makes sense as the generic kernel-related code, IPython.zmq is zmq-specific kernel-related code, etc.  The KernelManager is 100% zmq-specific.  If we do build a generic zmq-free base class, then _that_ would belong in IPython.kernel under this scheme.\n"

I'm still 50/50 on moving Kernel and KernelManger from zmq to kernel, so I will wait until we chat.\n\nHere's the gist, as I see it:\n- it makes sense to have the base Kernel and KernelManager in IPython.kernel, and currently the ZMQ versions are our bases\n  _however_\n- KernelManager, as it is, is tightly bound to the zmq wire protocol as implemented in zmq.Session\n- the same is true of Kernel\n- BlockingKernelManager should be adjacent to KernelManager\n- embed_kernel and IPKernelApp should be adjacent to Kernel\n- it does make some sense for KernelManager to _not_ be adjacent to Kernel, but `IPython.kernel` is not an appropriate name for the non-kernel part of that equation.\n"

I really like how this turned out and think it is such a huge improvement.  The code is much more transparent and logically organized.  There may be bug that this PR is introducing, but I think the only way we will find them is by using it.  Because of this, I think we should merge this unless you want to get some other eyes on this.\n"
