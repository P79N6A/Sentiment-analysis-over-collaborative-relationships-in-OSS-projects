    "body": "@Carreau I'm not having any luck with this. Here are the steps I performed\n1. Made a new virtualenv and installed IPython from the GitHub repo and the notebook dependencies. Command for installing IPython:\n   \n   ```\n   pip install -e git://github.com/ipython/ipython.git#egg=ipython\n   ```\n2. Created a new profile\n   \n   ```\n   ipython profile create slideshow\n   ```\n3. Cloned the ipython-static-profiles repository\n   \n   ```\n   cd ~/.ipython/profile_slideshow\n   git clone git://github.com/Carreau/ipython-static-profiles.git\n   ```\n4. Edited my `ipython_notebook_config.py` at the appropriate line with this\n   \n   ```\n   # Extra paths to search for serving static files.\n   #\n   # This allows adding javascript/css to be available from the notebook server\n   # machine, or overriding individual files in the IPython\n   c.NotebookApp.extra_static_paths = [\n       '/Users/clasher/.ipython/profile_slideshow/static',\n       '/Users/clasher/.ipython/profile_slideshow/static/css_selector',\n       '/Users/clasher/.ipython/profile_slideshow/static/slidemode',\n       '/Users/clasher/.ipython/profile_slideshow/static/nbviewer_theme',\n       '/Users/clasher/.ipython/profile_slideshow/static/init_cell',\n   ]\n   ```\n5. Created the `js` subdirectory for `custom.js`:\n   \n   ```\n   cd ~/.ipython/profile_slideshow/static/\n   mkdir js\n   ```\n6. Created a new file `~/.ipython/profile_slideshow/js/custom.js`; I tried the three different following\n   contents\n   1. Per the [readme](https://github.com/Carreau/ipython-static-profiles/blob/master/README.md):\n      \n      ```\n      $.getScript('/static/js/css_selector.js')\n      $.getScript('/static/js/slide_meta.js')\n      $.getScript('/static/js/init_cell.js')\n      ```\n   2. Since there's no actual path `/static/js/init_cell.js`, I tried\n      \n      ```\n      $.getScript('/css_selector/js/css_selector.js')\n      $.getScript('/slideshow/js/slide_meta.js')\n      $.getScript('/init_cell/js/init_cell.js')\n      ```\n   3. Since there's `css_selector`, `slideshow`, etc. already in the\n      `c.NotbookApp.extra_static_paths` from step 4 above, I tried just\n      \n      ```\n      $.getScript('/js/css_selector.js')\n      $.getScript('/js/slide_meta.js')\n      $.getScript('/js/init_cell.js')\n      ```\n7. Started the ipython notebook with\n   \n   ```\n   ipython notebook --profile=slideshow\n   ```\n\nNone of the `custom.js` configurations gave me any extra \"presentation\" button after changing the\nCell Toolbar type to \"Slideshow\". The toolbar looks the exact same.\n\nWould you please provide more explicit instructions?\n\nMy platform is OS X 10.7.5 with Python 3.3.1 from MacPorts.\n\n**Edit**: corrected the `custom.js` configurations and added command used to run the ipython notebook.\n"

Leaving cells undefined (-) works well!\n\nI have yet another question: IPython Notebook does not seem to be responding to changes in `static/slidemode/css/custom.css`; even after shutting down the server closing the browser tabs, starting the server back up again, and reopening the notebook. Then, when I reverted the changes to `custom.css` using `git checkout custom.css` so that it matches exactly the file at clone time, the centering of `h1` elements disappeared. I even tried clearing the browser cache to fix this and it had no effect. Do you know if CSS is being cached anywhere else?\n\nAlso, none of the CSS switch dialogs work for me. Maybe this is a separate problem or maybe it's related. I'm running off of the master branch of IPython.\n"
