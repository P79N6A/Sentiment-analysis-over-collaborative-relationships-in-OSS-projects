    "body": "A flag to echo the command-to-be-executed would be useful. The method used to format these is `get_ipython().var_expand(line)`, which you can use to see what a command would be:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nip = get_ipython()\r\nip.var_expand(\"\"\"\r\necho \"{x}\" | awk '{{print $$1}}\r\n'\"\"\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could implement a more bash-like parsing, which doesn't reach into single-quoted strings. That seems desirable, to me."
