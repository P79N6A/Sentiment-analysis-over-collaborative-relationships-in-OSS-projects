    "body": "It looks good already, thanks!  One usability note: if you could also fix a couple of annoyances of the nb completer compared to readline:\n- once there's only one completion, hitting `<tab>` should finish up the compleiton immediately.  Right now, if the filtering has brought the list down to one item, you first have to hit tab once to dismiss it, and then again to finish the completion.  It should dismiss _and_ complete with a single `<tab>`.\n- indeed it gets confused with uppercase letters. Try for example `plt.<tab>` and then type 'ci'.  It will offer Circle with uppercase C, which then doesn't actually complete.  It should match exactly the casing of what has been typed so far.\n- the first completion should also write as many letters as are unique up to the new stuff.  For example, if you do `plt.au<tab>` (with plt == matplotlib.pyplot), then all the completions start with 'aut'.  In the terminal, the 't' is automatically added and then the completions are shown.  Here you must manually type the 't'.  We really should match how readline works here, which is the right way to do it.\n\nThanks again for the good work!\n"
