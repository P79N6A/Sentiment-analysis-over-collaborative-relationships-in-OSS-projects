    "body": "I reviewed this in person with @SylvainCorlay, and the code looks good.  The only question we had at the time was whether or not the new `show()` method was necessary.  @SylvainCorlay convinced me that it is useful to have to be able to create a custom view that still interacts with the widget area, but doesn't  inherit from DOMWidget.\n\nI've tested the code and it works as expected, as long as no-one has objections, I'll merge this the next work day.\n"
