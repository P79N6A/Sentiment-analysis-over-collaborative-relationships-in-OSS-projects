Namespaces are sufficient! \nThere is another change which would be very useful, and could maybe be incorporated into this PR:\n\nI often find myself writing:\n\n``` JavaScript\nif(this.is_displayed) {\n   // do something which requires the dom to be populated\n} else {\n    this.on('displayed', function() {\n        // do the same thing\n    });\n}\n```\n\nMoreover, the variable `is_displayed` is lacking in general widgets. \nI opened PR #6168 to show how it simplifies container widgets for example (and even more in other portions of my code). However, this PR should probably be integrated into this one. Let me know if you think I should open a PR with these changes to your branch. \n"
