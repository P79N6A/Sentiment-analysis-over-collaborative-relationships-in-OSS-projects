    "body": "OK, that's not quite what I meant with the tests. We shouldn't mess with user visible folders in the test suite. Have a look at `IPython.utils.tempdir`. In the `setup()` function, put something like:\n\n```\nworkon_dir = TemporaryDirectory()\nos.environ['WORKON_HOME'] = workon_dir.name\n```\n\nThen in `teardown()`:\n\n```\ndel os.environ['WORKON_HOME']\nworkon_dir.cleanup()\n```\n\n`workon_dir` will need to be a global variable (or make the tests a class and attach it to the instance). Really, `teardown()` should restore `$WORKON_HOME` to whatever it was previously, but that's probably not a major concern.\n"

If so, is that small missing point a deal-breaker to merge it? Given this will be probably pretty popular, I'm willing to ask @fccoelho to improve the testing post-0.13 if need be, so that we can get it in now.\n\nThoughts?\n"
