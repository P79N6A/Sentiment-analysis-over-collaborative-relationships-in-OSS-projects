    "body": "Thanks, I hadn't spotted the duplicate. Having said that, t#514 is discussing a much more complex scenario, involving actually interacting with subprocesses (and it seems to be Unix based, as it's about pty-style interaction). For my requirements, a simple means of killing a rogue subprocess would do. Consider something as simple as `!sleep 50000`, where just being able to kill the sleep is all you want. (Maybe Ctrl-C works for this on Unix, but it doesn't on Windows).\n"
