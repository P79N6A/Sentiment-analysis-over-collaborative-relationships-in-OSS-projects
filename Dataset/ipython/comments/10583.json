    "body": "> I'll put together two PRs (one for master, the other for 5.x) that limits the insanity to old versions of pip (<6).\r\n\r\nIf you have pip <6 anyway IPython will likely fails to install (mostly on python 2) as pi will download IPython 6 and try to install it while it's not compatible.  So I think that expecting users to have a recent pip is reasonable.\r\n\r\nHappy to get a PR making things better though. Don't spend too much time on a PR for 5.x if the PR for master does not conflict, our bot will be able to auto backport.\r\n\r\nThanks !"
