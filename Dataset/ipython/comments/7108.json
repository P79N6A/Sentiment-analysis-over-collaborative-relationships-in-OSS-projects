I hope that this might improve matters, but even if it doesn't directly, the simplification is almost necessary in order to follow what's going on.\n- It's not as though people are going to be any less busy or any more keen to review this after 3.0 is out.\n\nI know it's a lot of complexity, but with most of this stuff, if you break it, you break it, it fails quickly and obviously. I've been testing it as I go, including interactive testing with the Qt console and the in-process examples.\n"

    "body": "These are nice clean ups, but I wonder this will affect third-party console clients that want to communniucate with a ZMQ kernel asyncronously? The following is probably not The Right Way To Do It, but in a client for IPython 2.x (an experimental plugin for Neovim) I do the following to recieve async notifications for messages:\n\n```\nclass IPythonVimApp(BaseIPythonApplication, IPythonConsoleApp):\n    kernel_client_class = KernelClient\n    def init_kernel_client(self):\n        self.kernel_client = self.kernel_manager.client()\n        self.kernel_client.shell_channel.call_handlers = self.target.on_shell_msg\n        self.kernel_client.iopub_channel.call_handlers = self.target.on_iopub_msg\n        self.kernel_client.stdin_channel.call_handlers = self.target.on_stdin_msg\n        self.kernel_client.hb_channel.call_handlers = self.target.on_hb_msg\n        self.kernel_client.start_channels()\n\n    def initialize(self, target, argv):\n        self.target = target\n        super(IPythonVimApp, self).initialize(argv)\n        IPythonConsoleApp.initialize(self, argv)\n```\n\n(where the target, running inside a different event loop, is aware notifications come from a different thread).\n\nNow how will this the simplest be done on the new infrastructure? To me it seems the new QtKernelClient and its helper classes does almost what another async console client wants (or at least mine); I mean very few parts of it are Qt specific. Do you think it would make sense to later refactor this into a generic async/thread-safe zmqsocketchannel/kernelclient (and perhaps implement the Qt kernel client on top of it)?\nIf it would be interesting, I could try implement this once this PR gets merged.\n"

    "body": "Thanks @bfredl for that use case.\n\nYes, it may well at some point make sense to split out a base class for a generic async client. I'd rather not do that here, because it's a big enough PR already, and since we only have one asynchronous client (the Qt console), I probably wouldn't get the abstractions right.\n\nThere are really two possibilities for async clients:\n- Run the pyzmq event loop in a thread and use some mechanism to go between that and your main event loop. This is what I've made the Qt console do for now, but it's the quick and dirty option.\n- integrate listening to the ZMQ sockets into your main event loop. This is a bit more work, but @minrk assures me that it is practical.\n"
