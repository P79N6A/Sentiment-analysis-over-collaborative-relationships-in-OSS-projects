    "body": "@Carreau : I've tidied up a few uses of `iterkeys()` (which is mostly easy, because iterating over a dictionary yields keys) and a couple of `itervalues()`. We obviously use `iteritems()` in quite a few places, and I haven't looked through them all yet.\n\n@bfroehle : I'm inclined towards gameplan 1 - merging soon so we give people plenty of time to find corner cases. It will make backports slightly harder, but hopefully there won't be too much stuff that we need to backport. We're thinking of doing a 1.1 release about a month after 1.0. I know it's a huge diff, but I don't think it's really going to get much easier to review in total if we break it up.\n"
