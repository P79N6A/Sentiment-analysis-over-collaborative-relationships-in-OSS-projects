I looked earlier and wasn't able to find a latex package to wrap content so it doesn't overflow the _mdframed_ boxes **without** breaking the multi-page support.  I think the best solution would involve measuring each line and breaking once the contents of the line reached the border of the _mdframed_ box.\n\nThoughts?\n"
