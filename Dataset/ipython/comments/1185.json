    "body": "As far as I know, you can't really do that. The 'real' stdout belongs to the kernel, which is in a separate process to the frontend you're using. It might even be on a different computer. The cost of this approach is that you can't use stdout as a raw tty device.\n\nAs a hack, you might be able to use `sys.__stdout__`, but note that it will write to stdout where you started the kernel, not necessarily where you started the frontend.\n\nI'm going to close this issue, because I don't think there's anything we can do about it. Feel free to discuss things on the ipython-user mailing list.\n"
