    "body": "It's late and I have to catch a flight in the morning, so  I can't really review this in detail.\n\nBut I want to record a _huge_ +1 from me on this idea: `FakeModule` has been a constant source of weird and obscure bugs over the years, and if we can get all the behavior we need without it, by all means go for it.\n\nHowever, I remember introducing it because certain behaviors with `%run` wouldn't work in the same manner than a plain python script at the shell without this hack.  I would like to think that all those reasons are now tested, so that if your changes don't break the test suite we're golden.  But that may be wishful thinking...\n\nSo please double, triple-check every imaginable scope/pickling/etc issue you can think of that could be affected by this...\n\nI'm almost thinking we should defer this to post 1.0 just to be safe, since it's more of a cleanup than a  burning necessity... I just don't want to get hit by an obscure but nasty bug introduced by this that would force us into a rapid 1.0.1....\n"
