So after upgrading to the dev version, the issue with `processed_output` is visible again. I can provide a basic git repository demonstrating the issue if necessary.\n"

    "body": "Ok, I've managed to avoid the issue. It turns out I had some old test files from when I was doing some work on the IPython directive. If you have a block in an rst file such as:\n\n```\n.. ipython::\n\n   In [2]: x = (\n\n   0,\n\n   1)\n```\n\nwhich is only possible through a pasting via Ctrl-V (in an old version of IPython)...then it would cause weird errors like I described above in sections of code that are unrelated to it. The exact error would depend on the version of Sphinx as well. \n\nAnyway, the above is no longer valid input (even when using Ctrl-V or %paste), so I think we can just ignore this issue..unless it comes up again.\n"
