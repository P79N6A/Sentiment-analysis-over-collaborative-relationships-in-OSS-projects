I'd only have to search up for the numbered prompt, instead of both up and down to find the boundaries of the input field. But in pure python mode, with no numbered prompts, I don't think that could work, could it? `In` doesn't seem to be bound. Also, in ipython mode, the user might for some reason bind something else to `In`, which would mess up retrieval of previous inputs for copying.\n\nSorry about merging in master. I'm still sort of winging it when it come to git. I'd be happy to create a new branch and pull request and reapply the net diff without all the messy commits.\n"

    "body": "Ah, I think this is all because there isn't a blank line in between successive inputs in pure mode like there is in ipython mode. I guess I have to limit myself to finding exactly one non-continuation input prompt (>>>), not just any number of either type of input prompt.\n\nAs for the `print '>>> not input'` thing, with the current approach, I don't think that's avoidable. As you say, it looks like a valid input line to the user (and to the prompt regexp), and I don't think there's any way to distinguish it from a true input line. This holds for ipython mode as well, where `In [1]: print 'In [2]: not input'` causes problems, but in that case I think they may be avoidable.\n\nPerhaps a tidier approach would be to start flagging lines (or line ranges) as input fields as they're generated. I don't suppose this already happens anywhere, does it? Could this info be saved as an attrib of the widget, maybe one of the `_history*` attribs in `HistoryConsoleWidget`?\n"

    "body": "The `print >>> noinput`/`print In[5]: foo` is definitely avoidable - you can only have one non-continuation prompt in a block.  The first one you see searching down means the end of the block. It doesn't, of course, protect against printing the continuation prompt.\n\nBut you are right, each input should be in an identifiable block that print statements _can't_ mess with.  The 'rich' widgets are actually HTML, I believe, so that should be quite easy, though I haven't the foggiest how to get access to that information.  It should be straightforward to drop each block in a `<div>`, but I honestly have no idea how that works.\n\nI also think it is perfectly appropriate for this to be a feature of the RichIPythonWidget, and thus not available in pure or plain mode (not that people actually use either, that I know of).  That would make this easier, and it would also allow you to simply identify the execution ID of the current block, and actually call `set_next_input()`, which would be cleaner than trying to figure out the contents of the current block, etc.\n"

Whenever you find the time to hack on it, you can decide whether it's easier to continue with this PR (and if so, just reopen it) or to make a clean new branch.\n\nThanks again for your interest, and best of luck with graduation!\n"
