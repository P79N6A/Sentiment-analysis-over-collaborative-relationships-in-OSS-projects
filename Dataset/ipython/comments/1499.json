    "body": "The `get_ipython` and `_ip` reports are all almost certainly incorrect, because these are names we inject into builtins.  The kernelstarter file is an incomplete implementation of the nanny process watching engines and isn't yet used (and probably shouldn't be in the repo).  The same goes for zmq.frontend and zmq.completer.ClientCompleter, which is really example code more than anything, and not used anywhere.  I'll check out the others.\n"
