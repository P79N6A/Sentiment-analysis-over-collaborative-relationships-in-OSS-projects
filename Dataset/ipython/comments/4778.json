    "body": "With files, this is something we expect third party code to call at runtime, to ensure that their files are in the correct place. So e.g. we avoid copying files that are already up to date. But with URLs, this clearly doesn't make sense - you don't want stuff to be downloaded repeatedly at runtime. I wonder if we should separate these concerns a bit more, so there's an API for 'install', and an API for 'ensure these files are in place'.\n\nAlso, as an alternative to recursing into directories and comparing timestamps, should we offer a way to symlink a directory into nbextensions, e.g. from something that has been installed at the system level? This would potentially be much quicker to check at runtime.\n"

    "body": "Okay, now I've added:\n- `check_nbextension`, that lets you check whether files exist without implying install (useful for avoiding redownload when installing from URLs)\n- `symlink` option, for installing with symlinks (useful for shipping js in a Python package, or git repo)\n- `IPython.load_extensions` in javascript, which is a shortcut for `require(['nbextensions/name'])` that calls `ext.load_ipython_extension()` if defined.\n\nI didn't fully separate check and install into separate actions, which I probably could do. But I thought that just adding a check-only method might be sufficient, and left the install behavior untouched.\n\nFor an example use case for the last bit, see minrk/ipython_extensions#19 and minrk/profile_default#1\n"
