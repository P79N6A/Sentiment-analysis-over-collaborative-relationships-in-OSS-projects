    "body": "Got it, thanks.  In that case, I'm actually going to merge it with a note that this was old code which can be removed once we're 100% sure nothing got screwed up.  It may save time if there's a problem, to someone looking for a fix, to have the old one right there instead of just in git's history.\n\nNote (I'll send an email to the list about this): in general please don't merge _from_ trunk into feature branches, to avoid criss-cross merges.  Keep feature branches fast-forwarding as they evolve, or even rebase them if truly necessary.  It makes the merge history much cleaner, and it's not an issue of pickiness, but of being able to more easily analyze in isolation what the branch does compared to the trunk (which a merge makes difficult).\n\nI'll make the merge with your state pior to 753f7eb, and will add the **builtins** fix as well as a comment on the code from 7dfe077.\n\nThanks for the great work, this should be merged and closed in a minute.\n"
