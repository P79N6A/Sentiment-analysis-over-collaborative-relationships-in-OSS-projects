So we can modernize them a bit, all I want to get is the ability to control the three 'basic' schemes (nothing, dark, light) from the command line including prompts...\n\nIn summary:\n- for 'linux', we can use the current green with brighter number default (green/red)\n- for 'lightbg', I'd do something similar, with a brighter/bolder number (blue/red)\n\nAnd otherwise apply the fixes for `--colors` to work.\n"
