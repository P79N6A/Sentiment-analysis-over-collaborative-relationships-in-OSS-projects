    "body": "The most logical place for this kind of thing is distutils `data_files`, which typically end up in `sys.prefix/share`. Unfortunately, it's not strictly reliable as a destination because distutils doesn't record where it puts files. It is probably fine in all cases one actually cares to support, though.\n\nAn extra wrinkle for things like that, though, is that docs shouldn't be mutable, and often aren't (e.g. `sudo pip install`). We do plan to address this with a sort of copy-on-open way for packages to specify \"my docs are here\" and the notebook can open them in a special way that doesn't attempt to edit the files in their original home, but that doesn't exist yet.\n"

To find the location, use:\n\n``` python\nimport mypackage\nmypackage.__file__\n```\n\nClosing as I don't think we're likely to do anything on this; and if we do the relevant repo is now jupyter/notebook.\n"
