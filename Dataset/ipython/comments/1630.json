I think we are seeing that Kernel should probably have been a SingletonConfigurable.\n\nI see two options here:\n1. embed_kernel as it is elsewhere (inject into calling scope).\n2. turning an engine into a kernel (essentially adding a few `bind` calls, on existing sockets), but with the same namespace.\n\nThe difficulty in 1. is in restoring the original namespace after the embed call leaves, and making the embed call block properly (it wouldn't).  I think I can do 2. with little difficulty.\n"

I have also tried to skim through the code (almost line by line).  This is enough code that at some point we just need to merge, have people start to use it and find any remaining bugs that show up.\n\nThe only other thing we have talked about that I don't see yet is the separate `promote_to_kernel` function.  \n"
