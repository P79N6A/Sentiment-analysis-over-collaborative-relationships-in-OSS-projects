The second was out of curiosity as one of the \"feature\" of IPython is to force-execute if there is  more than 2 newlines. \r\n\r\nPart of the relevant code is in [shortcut.py:L109-L127](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/194d1d7fe2fcc8547205bd7f54fcf63bee9df4e3/IPython/terminal/shortcuts.py#L109-L127). \r\n\r\nI guess there is some kind of conflation between the role of defining whether a check of code is \"complete\", or whether we should \"execute or add a new line\".\r\n\r\nI'm _guessing_ that the heuristic that check whether the input is multiline and whether the last character is already a new line or not should be sufficient. \r\n\r\nOne of the remaining questions is where to put that fix ? \r\n - in `shortcut.py`? if so it will only fix terminal IPython\r\n - in input_transformer2 ? Ithink that might be the right solution as this but will likely also affect QtConsole. \r\n\r\nLet me know if that's enough to at least get you started. \r\n\r\nThanks !"

    "body": "Oh, I didn't think it'd attach to this issue. Anyway, the reason it fails is that when we have\r\n```\r\nasync with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:\r\n    pass|   # < cursor is there\r\n```\r\nit runs `check_complete` on each line ending, which, in turn, executes `compile_command`, and the latter one raises a `SyntaxError` because 'async with' is used outside of the async function.\r\nIn my fork I just muted that `SyntaxError` but it's certainly not the brightest way to fix that, lol.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions/ideas:\r\n\r\n - should check if the `autoawait` is turned on. if it is, could ignore that specific `SyntaxError` case. I don't think it's a good solution, but maybe I'm also overcomplicating things.\r\n\r\n -  if the autoawait's on, feed the `compile_command()` with the code wrapped with the `_asyncify()`. i guess, this way it won't raise `SyntaxError`, but i'm not sure if the newline issue will be resolved because `_asyncify()` itself adds some levels of indentation and it easily can go messy.\r\n\r\n - maybe `_AsyncSyntaxErrorVisitor` can help any? But I guess it's for the other way around\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for the lack of dedication, I'd submit thw PR, but I hate writing tests and whatnot and also not sure of the better way to fix that. But I hope it's still useful for someone."
