I probably prefer this for 3.x due to its relative simplicity, but in the long run, I think the synchronization should probably be done at the lower level, forcing ordering at the channel or socket level, rather than per message type.\n\nNow that we understand working with promises and :horse: better, I think for 4.0 we should take a step back and rework the callbacks/event handling of messages to be consistent across the board, rather than the inconsistent mixture of approaches we have right now. Almost all of the problems we have with respect to these things are specific to widgets, and we have to be realistic about what widgets are going to be in 3.x.\n"
