Originally, my thought was that we would use something persistent on disk (maybe a simple sqlite db) to persist the path+title <-> notebook id mapping.  Do you view your approach as better (why?) or just a temporary fix until we can add disk persistence.\n"

Links would not be invariant across rename + server restart, but then again, that's not super reliable either, since it requires renames to be universally done via the notebook UI, and is still only invariant if the directory is never renamed.\n"
