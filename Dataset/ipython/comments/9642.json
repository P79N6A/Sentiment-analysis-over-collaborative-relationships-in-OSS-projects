    "body": "@takluyver Your comments here helped me through a similar problem with ipdb and understand that I can't use `set_trace()` directly in a Jupyter cell. ipdb seems to be working fine for me with that understanding. However, I'm running into code display problems with the `%%debug` magic. If this is a separate problem I'll make a new issue for it, but it seems related. Here's what I'm seeing:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9361152/53250612-be706580-3688-11e9-960c-0e3328e88337.png)\r\n\r\nSo I'm able to iterate over all the lines and print variable values just fine, but I can't see which line I'm on or show surrounding code lines with `l`. Any idea what's going wrong here?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"
