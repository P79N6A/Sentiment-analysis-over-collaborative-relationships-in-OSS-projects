But I don't think it should be built in - we said we wanted to really constrain the widgets we ship to a few basic HTML controls, and I think a 2D slider is much more specific. If we included that, there are hundreds of other conceivable widgets that we could include.\n"

    "body": "On one hand, the 2D dimensional slider is really the only nice way to represent a 2D vector with widgets (which is probably a very common type for most of our scientific users).  Using one slider for the X value and one for the Y is clunky.\n\nOn the other hand, this breaks the pattern that the rest of the widgets follow and as-is will not work with interact.  We would need to be able to get/set the value through a \"value\" key, not \"x\" and \"y\".  Also, the styling doesn't match any of the other widgets which makes this feel out of place.  Hacking together an appropriate mixed bootstrap / jquery ui theme for it would probably be difficult, like it was for the slider widget.\n\nMy vote is for this to be an example, with roughly a 30/70 weighting.\n"
