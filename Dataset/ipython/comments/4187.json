    "body": "Finally, I refactored it as you two were suggesting:\n- A preprocessor to tag cells using magic extension languages\n- The highlight filter now gets the full cell object, and highlights the cell depending on the metadata\n\nThe advantages of the preprocessor, is that it is configurable (now the languages re are in a configurable Dict as suggested) and it can be disabled easily.\n\nI changed the detection heuristic to be more strict, now a cell is tagged only if the '%%language' is found on the first line of the cell. This is to avoid false positives such as:\n\n``` python\nprint(\"\"\"\n%%R\n\"\"\")\n```\n\nPlease could you review the new version ?\n\nThanks,\n\nPablo\n"

Now, I'm not suggesting you do this, I'm just telling you that this is probably the easiest way to accomplish this.  \n\nContinuing one that point, if you had the custom lexer, you wouldn't need to pass the metadata into the highlight filter anymore.  Of course, I think having the language information in the metadata is useful because it's more power to the templates.  I wouldn't suggest removing it, but you would probably need to set the language as \"mixed\" or \"unknown\" if the preprocessor detected multiple languages.  \n"

[...] I wouldn't suggest removing it, but you would probably need to set the language as \"mixed\" or \"unknown\" if the preprocessor detected multiple languages.\n\nI fully agree.

The `default_config` property on subclasses is for enabling preprocessors that are _not_ on by default. Since this PR enables the preprocessor pretty much everywhere, that suggests that `default_config` is not actually the right way to do it, rather just adding it to TemplateExporter.preprocessors instead.\n\n**EDIT** fixed `default_preprocessors` -> `preprocessors` mixup.\n"

Still I have a couple of questions:\n\n1) I do not see a `TemplateExporter.default_preprocessors`\nThere is a `Exporter.default_preprocessors`, but from my understanding it does not enable preprocessors, it just makes them available. You still have to manually turn them on using `default_config`.\n\n2) I'm not sure that  MagicsHighlightPreprocessor should be enabled in the markdown or rst exporters, since the highlight filter is not applied on them.\n\nThanks,\n\nPablo\n"
