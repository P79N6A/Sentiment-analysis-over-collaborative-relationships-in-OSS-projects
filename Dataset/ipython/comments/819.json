    "body": "@jstenar, thanks for the updated work!  I think we're almost there.  But I see there are three new functions in the magic module now, so in addition to my in-line feedback, a couple of more general comments:\n- they are fairly generic utility functions related to module handling, so they should probably go elsewhere.  I'd suggest a new module in `IPython.utils`, named something like `modpaths.py`.  You can find a template with the necessary boilerplate  at `/docs/source/development/template.py`.\n- Now that you have a nice new module with just three functions in it, the next thing is to ensure that you also add in `utils/tests` a file named `test_modpaths.py` that tests each one of these in isolation.\n\nThis way, the code will be easier to reuse elsewhere and will be validated.  We want to move away from putting more and more tools into massive files like magic.py, that is already very unweildy.\n\nSo with a bit more iteration, we're close to having this solid for merge.  Thanks for being patient, but that's how we ensure we build a more robust project moving forward!\n"

But I see there are three new functions in the magic module now, so in addition to my in-line feedback, a couple of more general comments:\n> - they are fairly generic utility functions related to module handling, so they should probably go elsewhere.  I'd suggest a new module in `IPython.utils`, named something like `modpaths.py`.  You can find a template with the necessary boilerplate  at `/docs/source/development/template.py`.\n> - Now that you have a nice new module with just three functions in it, the next thing is to ensure that you also add in `utils/tests` a file named `test_modpaths.py` that tests each one of these in isolation.\n> \n> This way, the code will be easier to reuse elsewhere and will be validated.  We want to move away from putting more and more tools into massive files like magic.py, that is already very unweildy.\n> \n> So with a bit more iteration, we're close to having this solid for merge.  Thanks for being patient, but that's how we ensure we build a more robust project moving forward!\n> \n> I have pushed changes related to these comments\n"
