    "body": "Hi @PallaviBodepudi \r\n\r\nThanks for your question. Just to let you know that this is not a general Python to ask questions about learning Python, but more specifically about the development of the IPython software. I would suggest trying for example https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/ if you are starting with Python. \r\n\r\nTo take a screenshot I would though advise to google for \"Python and Selenium\", Selenium will help you to control what is known as a headless web-browser. \r\n\r\nI'm going to close the issue as there no actionable item from my side, but feel free to keep commenting. \r\n\r\n"
