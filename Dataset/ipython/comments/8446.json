Once you have installed it, it fails exactly once and every attempt to import after that succeeds in any notebook, python script, or other environment? Or do you see the failure more than once? Are you running dedupe master or stable? What version of Python and IPython?\n"

    "body": "If nobody can reproduce it, that makes it hard to figure out what's going on. Can you verify that it imported successfully outside the notebook immediately prior to failing to load in the notebook, with no other changes happening on the system in between? I would be surprised if that were the case. My guess is the issue has something to do with the use of `pkgutil.extend_path` in `dedupe.__init__`.\n\nThe only thing IPython does differently from non-interactive Python that's import-related is adding `''` to `sys.path` so that things can be imported from the working directory. If anyone does encounter the problem again, can they `print(dedupe)`, to verify its location? When you do see the problem, have you tried re-running the same import in the same process without starting the kernel?\n"
