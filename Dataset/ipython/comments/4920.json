    "body": "OK the basics are now working, along with a refactored `InlineBackend`. But @takluyver and @minrk there is a problem with the `%config` magic that prevents the following from working:\n\n`%config InlineBackend.figure_formats = {'png','pdf'}`\n\nThe problem is that the IPython input machinery sees the `{}` syntax as string fomatting and removes it leading to the expression `'png','pdf'` which is a tuple. We have two options here:\n1. Just make the `figure_formats` a `List` trait rather than `Set`.\n2. Dig in a try to find out why the `{}` is getting removed.\n"

    "body": "Disabling var_expand on several magics that don't actually want the extra magic would solve a lot of issues, but it's probably a task for another time.\n\nIn general, I'm not convinced that runtime config should really be the recommended approach for anything we expect people to actually change, since many configurables only make sense on first load, and can have weird, incomplete effects when changed at runtime.  I would suggest making the recommended approach directly calling `select_figure_format`, and making that function available in an official public API.\n"
