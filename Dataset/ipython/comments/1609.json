    "body": "Thanks for the quick fix.  Never mind the thread comment, I didn't see the threading code further up :)  Code looks good, but on testing I got this:\n\n```\n[NotebookApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels.\n^CShutdown Notebook Server (y/[n])?

    "body": "Thanks, message updated.\n\nThe interrupt message you mentioned is inherited from tornado, which logged interrupts.  I discovered that it's actually worse than you mentioned, as ^C actually goes unhandled, and the IOLoop _raises_ if you have pyzmq ≤ 2.1.7, invoking the crash-handler.  This one I can fix, though the prompt never shows up, and IPython just exits on ^C with old pyzmq.\n\nIn 2.1.9, you will get the message as you see it, but Tornado changed their behavior to be quiet about it (and pyzmq followed suit), so there is no such message in 2.1.11 and above.\n\nIf we want to suppress this message, we would have to silence the root logger used by tornado/the IOLoop, or require/recommend pyzmq ≥ 2.1.11.\n"
