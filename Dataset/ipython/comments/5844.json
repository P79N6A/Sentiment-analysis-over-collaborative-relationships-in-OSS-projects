Seems like there are three possible scrolling behaviors users might want:\n- Traditional page up/down behavior.\n- Based on a particular heading level (default to h1).\n- Based on slide metadata.\n\nTo enable everyone to play with these different options, he is going to implement these behaviors as three different `ScrollManager` subclasses and offer a drop down in the toolbar for selecting which is active (default to page up/down). Not sure if this is the final UI we will want, but this will make it easy for everyone to test the different options.\n"

With the current behaviour, if you accidentally add slide metadata to one cell, it prevents space-scrolling through the content above it. On the other hand, as @ivanov pointed out, you may want to have setup code at the start of a presentation that you can easily skip over.\n"

    "body": "> The current heading scroller matches the heading number exactly\n\nThat seems like a bug. Shouldn't it match `heading.level >= SM.heading_level`? Exact match only makes sense to me for level == 1.\n\n> it would seem to me that you still may want to have other heading levels that don't trigger a slide transition.\n\nIf you want to associate the scroll behavior with slide transitions, you would want to use the Slide mode. If you want to associate it with heading cells, you would use the heading behavior. Both are supported, we are just discussing which one is the most sensible default.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, every heading that I create is a place to jump to, so I don't normally have any headings that I would want this code to skip over. That means that level == 7 makes the most sense for me, personally, but a logical middle ground for the default would be h3/4, if people think using every heading is crazy. I do think only using h1 is unnecessarily extreme in the opposite direction.\n"
