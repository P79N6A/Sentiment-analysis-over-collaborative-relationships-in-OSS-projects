When you run `ipython profile create --parallel`, it generates these files.  But if IPython updates, those files do not get updated until you generate new ones, e.g. `ipython profile create pristine --parallel --reset`, which will create the profile `pristine` with brand-new config files, clobbering anything already there.\n"
