    "body": "I see why we have vertically compressed the input area here. It allows the textual representation to have the same height as when the user is typing into the field. If we want to keep that effect, then I think we need to work on the styling of the input area a bit more:\n- Need more than a 1px left padding.\n- Top and bottom paddings should be symmetric.\n- We might want to remove the border so it doesn't look so crammed vertically. But the border provides useful information to the user.\n\nOther CSS related comments:\n- We are reusing the `input_prompt` CSS class to mean two separate things (here in raw input and another in the actual input prompts). It works because one is a div and one is a span, but we shouldn't rely on that.\n- We are also reusing the `raw_input` CSS class in two places here. Probably should use something different for one of these as well.\n\nHere is an input area with more symmetric vertical paddings. The prompt would need fixing (along with a display of inline-block (so padding works).\n\n![screen shot 2014-03-13 at 4 41 20 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/27600/2416639/2764c95c-ab09-11e3-9a7b-be29a9b95454.png)\n"
