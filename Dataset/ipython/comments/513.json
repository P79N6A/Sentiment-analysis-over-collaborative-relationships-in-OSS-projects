It is true that the result does not always align with 4-space indentation, but that's because the whole console is a rich text field, so the tab marks will actually vary relative to the line start depending on the length of the input prompt.\n\nWe should probably bind <tab> to insert 4 spaces, to prevent confusion.\n"
