    "body": "I asked the question about `%install_ext` missing from new IPython on mailing list, and got reasonable reply from @Carreau \n\nHowever, many of IPython extension are single script programs. Asking to write valid package on pypi seems like unnecessary overkill for existing and possible future extensions. It's much easier to host live extension as a repo on GitHub or even Gist or any server. It does not stop you from writing Python package if necessary. Just look at the wiki: https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Extensions-Index\n\nIMHO, not having features as full fledged Python package should not restrict IPython extension. `%load_ext` exists, but why manually downloading extension and copying to specific folder, when that job was perfectly handled by `%install_ext` magic? Maybe we can rename this magic to `%download_ext` if you feel against it? I know I can't reverse the wheel, but I'm trying regardless.\n\nAgain IMHO, uninstall/upgrade feature does not have enough weight to remove this magic. Running `%install_ext <url>` will upgrade same script, and removing the extension is not critical as it's not loaded by default.\n"

    "body": "I honestly doubt make a \"valid\" python package is that hard.\n\nI'm pretty sure I can make an extension into a package in less than 5min. In\nmost case likely less than 2 (including publish  on PyPI as well, but agreed I\nhave my credentials set-up); \n\nLet's take the `ActiveState Code Recipes magics` in your link. \n\nI haven't look at  it yet; I'm pretty sure I can do the following and it will work:\n\n```\n$ pip install flit\n$ mkdir test_active_state_recipes\n$ cd test_active_state_recipes\n$ mkdir test_active_state_recipes\n$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/debjan/ipython-recipes-magic/master/recipes.py >> test_active_state_recipes/__init__py\n$ # edit above file to give a docstring with to module and set `__version__ = '0.0.1'`\n$ git init \n$ flit init # press enter 4 times (5 time maybe) ?\n$ git add . \n$ git commit -am 'turn receipe into a package'\n$ flit wheel --upload.\n```\n\nThat should be it; I won't count pushing on GitHub as creating a GitHub repo,\nand not harder for a package than just drop a file in gist. \n\n> IMHO, not having features as full fledged Python package should not restrict IPython extension. %load_ext exists, but why manually downloading extension and copying to specific folder, when that job was perfectly handled by %install_ext magic?\n\nNo it was not; `install_ext` was a relatively gross hack, which was probably\nconvenient, but against all the best practices that we have in open source;\nnot considering the security issue.\n\nThe thought that \"Python Packaging is hard\" is an historical vestige of how it\nwas half a decade ago. The time you put into making a package and having people\nbeing able to install it just by it's name is way compensated by the time you\nwon't have remind user of were your package are, and how to install it. \n\nI'll try to actually make the above in less than 5 min; I'm currently in a\ntrain so have bad connection, so it's might be slow.\n\nSo let's try... See you in 5 hopefully...\n"

    "body": "`<5 minutes later>` roughly, I got confused by the screen recording.\n\nIt took me.... 1min19 sec (I can post the vide on youtube, I recorded myself, but I'm in a train),\nFair enought, I cheated, I copy pasted the curl line, and flit was already installed; but\nthe package is [there](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/test_active_state_recipes) and can be \"just\" pip-installed. \n\nI'll remove it at some point, as I am not the author; and it'a bad to take credit from someone else. \n\nI still strongly believe that removing `install_ext` is well worth the cost benefit.\n- It is less functionality to maintain for us\n- Almost nothing (1min20s, let's push to 5min) for authors at least once; just a `flit wheel --upload` on new versions. \n- A tremendous gain for users that \"just\" need to `pip-install <name>`\n\nIt can be indeed burdensome to write a package with flit as it enforces that the module have a docstring... Though `setup.py` is not much more complicated. Flit through forces you to choose a license; (code without license can't be used), and has a quite easy to remember Cli API. (`flit init`, `flit wheel` and `flit wheel --upload`) being the only 3 things you need to remember. \n\nI'm also pretty sure the time spent on asking to reintroduce `%install_ext` over the next few years will likely be much greater than the time spent converting these extensions to packages.\n\n[edit] Video is non reference and in process but shoudl be viewable soon [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB0ddmrkXUo) [/edit]\n"
