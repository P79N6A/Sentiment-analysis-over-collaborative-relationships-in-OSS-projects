    "body": "@minrk I have pushed a commit that adds ipc support to `MultiKernelManager`.  I have also added tests and everything works.  There are two issues:\n- To get that working I have to make `KernelManager` a `Configurable` so the `ip` and `transport` can be set using config.  That means this PR changes `zmq.KernelManager`.  Should I wait for the in process kernel PR to be merged.  The changes are pretty small and would probably be easy to resolve.\n- But, right now, the tests leave the ipc files on disk.  This is related to a bug in `KernelManager`.  Basically, `shutdown_kernel` clears the connection file, but not the ipc file.  When the `KernelManager` is garbage collected, it sees the connection file was already cleared, so it doesn't attempt to clear the ipc file.  Should the connection file and ipc file have exactly the same lifetime?  How should I approach fixing this?  Again, it will involve more changes to `zmq.kernelmanager.py`.\n"

I'm pretty sure the only reason it isn't is that it predates config.  And yes, I think you should wait for the inprocess PR - I gave it a look over, and it looks pretty good to me.  Code duplication was my main concern in that ongoing work, which seems to have been addressed.  If you want to give it one more opinion, we can probably get it in today.\n\n> But, right now, the tests leave the ipc files on disk. This is related to a bug in KernelManager.\n\nYes, this should always be considered a bug if a KM cleaned up leaves files around.  KM has a `_cleanup_ipc_files` method, so it should just be a matter of determining why that isn't properly called.\n"
