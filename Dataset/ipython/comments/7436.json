    "body": "Good question. At first I thought it happened with any png (and was surprised it hadn't been caught yet...). I checked again now and realized it only occurs if the width and height are explicitly saved as metadata, which at least seems to happen for matplotlib plots if you are using the `retina` figure format.\nSo to test it, a notebook with a single cell is enough:\n\n``` python\n%matplotlib inline\n%config InlineBackend.figure_formats = set(['retina'])\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([0,1],[1,0])\n```\n\nIf you run and save this notebook, running `ipython nbconvert --to html` on it gives the error.\n"
