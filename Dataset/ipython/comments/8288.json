    "body": "Since the dependencies are unreleased, there's a requirements.txt for installing them from git, which will become unnecessary once there are released versions.\n\nThe alternative approach for this temporary problem is using `dependency_links`, which is deprecated by pip, and disabled by default. The only advantage is that with dependency_links, installation from master can be done with a single call:\n\n```\npip install --process-dependency-links -e git+https:...\n```\n\nwhich isn't true of the requirements.txt, which requires manual clone:\n\n```\ngit clone git+https://github.com/ipython/ipython\ncd ipython\npip install -r requirements.txt -e .\n```\n\nI'm inclined to use requirements.txt for now, and only switch to dependency_links if the lack of a single call dev-install becomes too annoying.\n"
