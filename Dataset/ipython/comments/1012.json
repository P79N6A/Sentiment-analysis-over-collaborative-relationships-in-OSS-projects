But I don't want to over-engineer up-front; we should obviously keep those use cases in mind, but we shouldn't try to fake a multiuser authentication mechanism here.  The current notebooks is firmly and squarely tied to a true unix user, this is just a mechanism to authorize sharing. But you are giving someone effectively your system shell...\n\nWhat we're building is orthogonal to a separate multiuser system that can be implemented outside of the notebook to manage users, accounts, etc, and _then_ will use the single-user notebook for each user.  This is just a way for an individual user to effectively give access to his shell to friends/colleagues without having to give up his real unix password or provide a full ssh login.  But for the duration of the session, the other users have _full_ system access, so it's not something to be granted lightly.\n"
