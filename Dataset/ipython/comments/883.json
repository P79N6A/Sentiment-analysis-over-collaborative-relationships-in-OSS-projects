It's best not to push a merge from upsteram into the pull request, as it will make the final commit graph more complicated than necessary.  You can fix the issue by doing, in your local copy of this branch:\n\n<pre>\ngit reset --hard c0c597c\ngit push --force\n</pre>\n\n\nThat will remove that final merge operation so we can bring your work into master without back-and-forth merges.\n\nThanks!\n"
