I'm just thinking of extending `::x::` to `::Tex::x::` `::html::x::` for corresponding repr. (hence my question on messaging and user_variables) and the final syntax we would choose, to make the nbconvert modification. \n\nAlso nbviewer ships with a modified version of nbconvert, so I would like nbconvert to support conversion without going through files to dump the modified version which is a pain to maintain. \n"

We\n  want to pick something that is a good match to markdown's syntax.  What\n  alternatives were considered?\n- Do we currently store both the original and rendered content for a\n  markdown cell?  Otherwise, we won't be able to capture this content in\n  nbcovert logic.\n- But, even if we save the rendered HTML content, it won't help nbcovert in\n  many cases, because it will use the original markdown in many cases.  What\n  we really need to do is save a dict of the keys/values that are used for\n  that cell.  Then those values can be used by nbcovert in whatever way is\n  needed.

    "body": "> Isn't the prompt number already available as a special variable?\n\nYes, it in in metadata... bu if you have a real `prompt_number` variable what do you do ?\n\n>  Have we thought very carefully about the usage of the `::` syntax.  We\n> want to pick something that is a good match to markdown's syntax.  What\n> alternatives were considered?\n\nI'm open to suggestion. ::something:: was easy to parse and sufficiently different from md/html/code, fast to type.\n\n> Do we currently store both the original and rendered content for a\n> markdown cell?  Otherwise, we won't be able to capture this content in\n> nbcovert logic.\n\nActually at convert time you can render the html with phantom js as png and put it as an image in TeX... where is the problem ?\n\n>  What we really need to do is save a dict of the keys/values that are used for\n> that cell.  Then those values can be used by nbconvert in whatever way is\n> needed. Does this make sense? \n\nI think I prefer my approach   : \n\nextract from ipynb diff\n\n``` diff\n+     \"cell_type\": \"markdown\",\n+     \"metadata\": {\n+      \"literate\": {\n+       \"data\": {\n+        \"a\": \"set([1, 2])\",\n+        \"f\": \"<function <lambda> at 0x102383758>\",\n+        \"hello\": \"'world'\",\n+        \"iDontExist\": \"[ERROR] KeyError: u'iDontExist'\",\n+        \"x\": \"16\"\n+       },\n```\n\nDon't you like it ?\n\nNo kidding, I think it would be great to extend  to have \n\n``` js\n'variableName':{\n  'text'  : 'whatever',\n  'LaTeX' : '\\w{ha}t_ever',\n  'png'   : '24e5bcf6.....4'\n}\n```\n"

    "body": "I'm not sure this is totally doable as a js plugin as you indeed interfere with the way markdown is rendered. \nYou need to : \n- be warned when a cell is rendered. (easy, event) \n- ask kernel for value (doable)\n- ask the cell to be re-renderd (could do)\n- change the actual content of what would be rendered.\n- track which rendering request are \"yours\" and which one are not to avoid infinite loop. \n\nWhat could be done is the ability to insert a call to a function between 'render request'  call and 'do rendering'\n\nThe intermediate function would be responsible for calling 'do rendering' with the modified source. \n\nThe problem here is that if the kernel is busy, you wait for the cell to be rendered, and if you go the callback way it is difficult to chain the 'modifier' functions. \n"
