Perhaps we'll just be back to FakeModule :)  I\njust wanted to encourage you to think about this question with fresh\neyes.  I implemented the FakeModule solution many years ago, and it's\nquite possible that either I missed a better approach either out of\nignorance or because something newer could be available in Python now\n(that code is probably from the Python 2.1 days).\n\nIf we can't do any better no worries.\n\nCheers,\n\nf\n"

We've had so many problems with pickling in the past that it would be nice to have at least a minimal set of smoke tests for: define a class interactively, pickle it, load it in the same session, load it in a  different session with plain python (can be done with a simple python -c \"import pickle;...\" statement run in a subshell).\n\nEven if we don't catch the obscure corner cases, at least it will increase our chances of not causing a dumb regression in the future.\n\nOther than that, good to merge from my side!\n"

    "body": "Yeah, that's the sort of corner case I'm glad someone found before we pushed it. I've changed the code so that that can't happen, and added a test. But the changes required led to the pickle test failing again (although it still worked interactively), so there were a couple more changes to our test framework (doctests were interfering with the namespaces). All the tests are passing again, and I've checked both pickling and issue #387 interactively.\n\nI've also removed the `make_user_namespaces` method on InteractiveShell. I think our namespace production is too tied to initialising the shell to easily separate out that part. It's not just a case of making some dictionaries and attaching them as attributes (although that should work if you do, but performance will be worse, because it has to copy the user_ns after each execution).\n"
