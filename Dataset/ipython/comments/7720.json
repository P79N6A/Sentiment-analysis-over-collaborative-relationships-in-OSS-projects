I actually thought of that and intentionally didn't do it since you actually can't save during that period since the notebook hasn't loaded completely.  But I have **no** objection to changing it, seeing that it could be annoying to see that icon the 99% of time that you open a notebook (since opening a notebook that is actually read-only is probably rare).\n\nEdit: Added no\n"
