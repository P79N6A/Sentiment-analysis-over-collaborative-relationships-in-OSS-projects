    "body": "Hi, \n\nWe do have plan to completely refactor the dashboard in one of the next version. There is still some work needed in the backend (#5938 for example).\n\nI think we have some design of the GUI-refactor we would like somewhere. @ellisonbg were you the one who took pictures of the white board last January ? I don't think we have investigated the multicolumn layout yet, but it is an interesting concept. I can see the use of the right panel to have information on the selected notebook (like in finder), which would be nice.\n\nI have one comment about the screenshot. How do you know the folder of column N that is show in column N+1 ?\n\nYou can always open a PR, though I cannot assure you that this is something that will be accepted.\nI'm also wondering how this plays with backend like Bookstore. @rgbkrk ?\n"

    "body": "Thanks for the comments. As I said, it is still a work in progress that I could abandon if you guys are already planning to refactor this part. I basically learnt javascript as I worked on this, so the code is sometimes not as nice as I would like to be. So let me one commit to clean up a bit.\n\n@Carreau, the only way to know so far which path is open is to look at the breadcrumbs (which I had to recode in javascript BTW). However, I think it is extremely easy to add a class to the open element and associate a little triangle to mark it. \n\n@damianavila I can certainly look into that. I must be easy to just sweep the old notebook class and provide mine instead.\n"
