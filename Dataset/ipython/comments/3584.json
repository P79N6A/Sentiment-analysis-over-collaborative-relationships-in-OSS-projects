The only reason the convertfiguretransformer showed up in this PR is the writer classes.  About the remote image feature, I believe @ellisonbg and I talked about that in our sprint last Monday but decided it would require us to parse the markdown & html ourselves..  Which would be out of the scope.  However, there is now a feature that allows the user to specify referenced \"files\".  The referenced files get copied to the output directory.  We could enable URLs, but that wouldn't replace URL image references in the markdown and html (within the doc.)\n"

    "body": "You posted a lot of comments on code that will change, so I thought I'd just respond in a comment on the PR.  Also, the majority of design was worked out in person with @ellisonbg (over a couple of days), so I'm pinging him for input too:\n- Whether or not we use YAML is matter of preference.  We just need a way to serialize a dictionary (other than the config system) to provide directory level configurability.\n- The notebook name is coupled with the export code to allow things like extract figure transformer to distinguish between notebooks when multiple notebooks are exported at once.  This information was available in the meta data but has now been removed.\n- I know you don't like the file extension being coupled with the exporter, but unless you have a suggestion, other than maintaining a separate dict format/extension, it's the only viable way I can see how to store that information.\n- That is the convert figure base, I'm not sure what you mean by it won't work...?\n- The reason I replace the line-endings explicitly is because I don't want to sub-dict yet again to \"text\" and \"binary\".  Also, more often than not, the text file contents should be referenced directly from the template, not extracted to the drive.  Having a bunch of *.text files laying around is silly.  \n- I don't think you're annoying at all, I appreciate your input very much.  The API can always be extended.  The only major modifications to the API are the removal of the filters/transformers function parameters (in exchange for traitlets with dotted object name support [loading figures and transformers from there namespaces]) and the addition of the optional notebook_name parameter (see export.py, trickled down to exporter.)  \n\nThe YAML stuff may not be included.  It's very much influenced by dexy.it.  All of the YAML is ONLY for use by the command line tool.  The YAML logic is all in the app.py and should have no effect on the API.  Any changes you see to the API are for the writers and extract figures transformer.\n\nThe writer, changes to the export module and exporters, extract figure transformer, and figure converter should all be very straight forward.\n"

I do think we are doing too much at once here.\n\nI know the code is separate and largely independent, so perhaps it's best if the YAML code is pulled to a second PR, and we keep this PR just for transformers/writers plus tests.\n"
