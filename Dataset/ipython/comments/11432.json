    "body": "Our goal here is to get something like the following. Once it is working we can refine a nd get a better User interface: \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ipython\r\nPython 3.6.5 | packaged by conda-forge | (default, Apr  6 2018, 13:44:09)\r\nType 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information\r\nIPython 7.2.0.dev -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.\r\n\r\nIn [1]: class Foo:\r\n   ...:     pass\r\n   ...:\r\n\r\nIn [2]: class Bar(Foo):\r\n   ...:     pass\r\n   ...:\r\n\r\nIn [3]: Foo?\r\nInit signature: Foo()\r\nDocstring:      <no docstring>\r\nType:           type\r\nSubclasses:      - Bar    <- that is new and useful\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we have only one subclass, we probably want to limit to the first few subclasses if we have hundreds. \r\n\r\n\r\n## How to implement that. \r\n\r\n1) make sure you have IPython working on your machine. We recommend installing anaconda. And then `conda install ipython`\r\n\r\n2) clone this repository:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/ipython/ipython\r\n```\r\n\r\nCd into the repository and do a dev-install : \r\n```\r\n$ cd ipython\r\n$ pip install -e . \r\n```\r\n\r\nnow when you start `$ ipython` , the third live should say something like `7.2.0.dev` if you see dev, then all s good. This mean that you run IPython from the source, and noot from the install packages. You are officially a developper now. \r\n\r\nTime to do modifications to the source code. They will be taken into account everytime  you restart IPython . \r\n\r\nIn our case we want to modify `IPython/core/oinspect.py`. Around line 830 find the line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif inspect.isclass(obj):\r\n```\r\nUnder this block we want to modify `out`,  to contain the list of subclasses. \r\n\r\nWe can get all the subclasses of `obj` by using `obj__subclasses()`\r\nAs we want a something that look nice to the user we are actually interested in in each subclass name, and not the subclass them selves. That is to say we want to have:\r\n\r\n`Subclasses:      - Bar` and not `Subclasses:      - <class bar at 0x123456>`\r\nso let's so around line 862: \r\n\r\n```\r\nnames = [sub.__name__ for sub in obj.__subclasses__()]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe now want to join all the names by commas for example:\r\n```\r\nall_names = ', '.join(names)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand let's now put that into `out` under the names `subclasses`.::\r\n\r\n```\r\nout['subclasses'] = all_names\r\n```\r\n\r\nGood ! We've done the hard work. \r\n\r\nNow close to line 642 find `elif info['isclass']`, \r\n\r\nModify close to the end of the block to look like : \r\n\r\n```diff\r\n append_field(_mime, 'File', 'file')\r\n append_field(_mime, 'Type', 'type_name')\r\n+append_field(_mime, 'Subclasses', 'subclasses') # line added\r\n```\r\n\r\nSave the file, Open IPython and try the code at the top of this comment.\r\n\r\nIf it works will go through how to commit it push it on github ad make a pull-request \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "Following some question about branching/forking the repository, in particular do you need to do a branch, or to fork before making any changes. \r\n\r\nIt is IMHO, mostly a question of taste, and where/when to put the complexity. \r\nSome people will tend to - before doing any work – create a new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git branch a-new-name\r\n$ git checkout a-new-name\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is typically creating a named alternate reality that diverge from `master`, at the time you wrote `git branch a-new-name`, it is in no way mandatory – branch names are _convenience_ names for human, and can be anyway move around, renamed after the fact. \r\n\r\nIt is also in no way mandatory for the names of the branch on your local machine to match the names on github. It is also perfectly fine to push `master` on GitHub. You cannot do anything wrong as you do not have anyway permission to push on this repository. You can only screw-up your fork, and if anything as branch names are _convenience_ name they can always be fixed after the fact. \r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a gif of me pushing on my local master branch to the master branch of my github fork, \r\nand then pushing my local master branch to another name. \r\n\r\n![example push](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335567/47865715-2806f400-ddba-11e8-9259-f7069963fc32.gif)\r\n\r\nHere are some further instructions once your code is ready:\r\n\r\n - Feel free to commit any time: `git add <changed file>`, `git commit`, Write you commit message and `<esc>wq` to save and quit (or `git commit -a -m \"message for the commit\"`).\r\n - For ipython (press the fork button at the top right of the page). \r\n - Add your fork at as `remote` of your clone: `git remote add cmentzel git://github.com/cmentzel/ipython`\r\n - push to your repository: `git push cmentzel` (here you can put more option but that is sufficient)\r\n\r\nGit will tell you something like: \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git push cmentzel \r\nEnumerating objects: 5, done.\r\n...\r\n...\r\nremote: Create a pull request for 'another-name' on GitHub by visiting:\r\nremote:      https://github.com/cmentzel/ipython/pull/new/another-name\r\nremote:\r\nTo ssh://github.com/cmentzel/ipython\r\n * [new branch]          master -> master\r\n```\r\n\r\nVisit the above URL and submit the pull request. We can figure out the rest from there. In particular once you have submitted the pull request that would allow me to do extra fixes and the given branch if necessary. \r\n\r\nGit is complex and take some time to grasp, but regardless of what you do you will have a really hard time breaking anything. \r\n\r\n"
