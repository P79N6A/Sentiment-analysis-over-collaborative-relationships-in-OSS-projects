    "body": "I'm afraid you may have re-adjust your expectations somewhat: the qtconsole is not a \"normal terminal\". In particular, it does not currently support any ANSI sequences for (non-forward) cursor movement, and this includes the '\\r' and '\\b' characters.\n\nI have tried to emulate a real terminal when practical, but robust support for arbitrary cursor movement is a pretty serious effort. I may find some time to work on this, but don't hold your breath.\n\nThat said, you are welcome to dig into the code. Feel free to ask for guidance if you are so inclined.\n"

Having said that, it would be very cool to have proper support of non-forward cursor movement, so  @eteq, if you manage to have a  go at this, we'd be delighted to incorporate the improvements.\n"

    "body": "The point is that by necessity, the qt console is _not_ a terminal emulator: it's a widget that feels in many ways like a console, but it has inline graphics, rich html support, and many features that simply break the assumptions of a pure terminal emulator.  A terminal emulator is a very constrained device that matches the assumptions of old-style vt-100 type environments, with a character model for addressing the 2-d space with an equispaced grid of rows and columns.  Our qt console is a real GUI app with pixel-level addressing, proportional fonts, graphics, etc.  That gives it much of its power, but also imposes some limitations in that we can't simply blindly reuse terminal emulator code that wants to address an 80x25  grid of fixed-width characters.\n"
