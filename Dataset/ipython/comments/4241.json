    "body": "Hi there @ellisonbg, I figured it would be a shame to leave this one when it was almost done so I gave it a crack and I think I have addressed most of the issues you brought up before. Not the caching issues though. \n\nI have only tested this against 1.1.0 because I don't run master, and I haven't tested it on python 3 either. But I don't see why it wouldn't work. I test most of the possibilities in this notebook and it seems to work\n\nhttp://nbviewer.ipython.org/6754266\n"
