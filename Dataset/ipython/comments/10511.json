    "body": "> Why is the info() method deprecated when we're still using it? :-S\r\n\r\nTo remove it at some point, I guess. I'm unsure if the full method is deprecated or just the `formatter` kwarg, which is what the warning warns about. I'm digging through this piece of code, and IIRC it's becaue we want to replace `info` by something that return a mimebundle, and that you'd better cann the method on the shell object instead of the inspector itself."
