And since Brian will be reworking the config stuff over the next few days, might as well have it pypy-ok so those guys can cleanly track our work and alert us of any incompatibilities.\n\nThanks, and also to @antocuni!\n\n@ellisonbg, just a heads-up that I think this is good to go as-is.  Remember to update off master for this small change any config work you might have; shouldn't cause any problems (famous last words :)\n"
