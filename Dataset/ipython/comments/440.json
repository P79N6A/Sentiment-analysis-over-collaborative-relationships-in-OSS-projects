    "body": "@takluyver, I don't use EPD on linux, unfortunately.  I'm pinging @rkern in case he can get in touch with someone at Enthought who does the linux epd work who could help.\n\nOne thing that could be done would be to instrument the code to log everything to a file instead of to stdout.  Right now we don't have an easy flag for that, so it would need to be done manually.  But replacing `sys.stdout/err` with an open file object by hand in the kernel should do the trick as a temporary hack, and might provide useful info. @joonpy, if you are willing to play with that and can get any diagnostics, do send them our way.  Unfortunately I don't have the time/bandwidth right now to set up an EPD/linux environment to try and replicate this...\n"
