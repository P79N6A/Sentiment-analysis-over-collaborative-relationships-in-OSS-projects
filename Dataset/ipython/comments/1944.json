It does not transform the prompt to  `%` anymore, but py trying to get a common prefix with what the user typed you can't **fast-forward** the completion as it does with completions without leading `%` items.\n\nAnd I'll let you try with regex :-)\n"

I just tried to mimic this behaviour as best as I could, because I saw a regression in the current behavior. \n\nSo please consider this PR as both a fix and a proposal for enhancement that could eventually be brought to other frontend.\n\nI just want to point out that it is the behaviour of the current notebook completer, but for the sake of consistency between frontend, I would accept to remove tis 'feature' also from the notebook if you think it is necessary.\n"

I think the common-suffix line is the best way of doing what it does.\n"
