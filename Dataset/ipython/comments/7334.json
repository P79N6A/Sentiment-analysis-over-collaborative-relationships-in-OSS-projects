There is an indicator in \nthe upper right side that tells wether the kernel is connected or not, and the js console often show file and line of error on the right.\n\nThanks ! \n"

On the upper-right side, the `Kernel (dark circle)` should after a few seconds change for `IPython (Python 2)` then the dark spot should become empty, meaning the kernel is. It usually is pretty fast, but may take a few seconds.\n\nTry Kernel -> restart kernel then same as above. \n\nDoes it solve you problem ?\n"
