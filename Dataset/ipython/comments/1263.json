Let's close this one for now; ultimately it would be nice to be able to let users define their frontend keybindings as well, like many apps do, but for now breaking the x/c/v association really would be murder.  Sorry @Carreau to break your existing muscle memory, but in the early evolution of a project like this it's inevitable to find some dead ends we need to correct for.\n"
