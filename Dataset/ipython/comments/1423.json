Does the notebook server run as a different user than the account I launch it under?\n\nIs there a way to make the notebook server run as the same user to avoid this confusion or make it easier to debug?\n\nAlso, I noticed that in the notebook server, I must call\n\n```\nimport pywintypes\nimport win32com\n```\n\nIf I don't import pywintypes before importing win32com it does not work. Wish I understood why.\n"
