    "body": "The _contains_ method for a NDFrame checks in the _info_axis for that NDFrame. What this means is that it's checking the generic, range-based index for your series. \r\n\r\nSo for the case where it returns False, it is looking over an index with only 0 in in, and doesn't find a matching 1. \r\n\r\nIn the case where it returns True, it is looking over an index containing 0 and 1 and returns True.\r\n\r\nBasically, the in operator matches against values in the index, rather than the actual data contained in the series and the code snippets above seem to be functioning as intended."
