Similar question, why do we have ****kwargs** then?\r\n\r\n_dropna_: series.py says that the doc-string is coming from `generic.py ` (`(@Appender(generic._shared_docs['to_excel'] % _shared_doc_kwargs)`) but I searched in `generic.py` and I can only find the function _drop_. I don't know what to do about this one. _dropna_ signature in `frame.py` and `panel.py` are different because `frame.py` has thresh=None\r\n\r\n_transpose_: I don't know where the doc-string is coming from, so I did not edit it.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?"
