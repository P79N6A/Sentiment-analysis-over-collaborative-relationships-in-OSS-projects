    "body": "@matthew-brett Thanks for reporting. See also https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/14621, which is probably the same issue and is indeed already fixed in master. Workaround for now is to use an older version of dateutil or just to use `'Asia/Tokyo'` instead of `'dateutil/Asia/Tokyo'`.\r\n\r\nWe are certainly planning a 0.19.2 release, and are also going to include python 3.6 compat in that."
