But thanks for the work!\n\nBut something else, I was wondering if this part of pandas (qtpandas) wouldn't be appropriate to live as a separate project?\n\nNot to discourage your efforts! I rather think this can be positive: not tied to the release process/schedule of pandas, encourage that some people take ownership of the project (I think there is at the moment not really a core developer who is actively maintaining this), publicize it separately, .. \nAnd further, I think it also doesn't fully fit in the scope of core pandas.\n\n@datalyze-solutions @rominf would you be interested in that?\n\n@jreback @cpcloud @hayd @immerrr @takluyver\n"

I think that the vast majority of Pandas users don't need Qt bindings, moreover, the connection between those two projects is quite weak.\n\nI propose to name it `pandas-qt` (Pandas is more important that the Qt in this project and people would search by `pandas` I think). Of course this should be uploaded to PyPi.\n\nI haven't looked at your work, @datalyze-solutions, but it seems that rewriting everything from scratch was worth to do.\n"
