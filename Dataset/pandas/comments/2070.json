    "body": "I noticed when I install the pre-built binaries for Python 2.7 on Windows I don't run into quite the same error; in that case Python doesn't crash but the call to resample() nonetheless returns an NaN. I built the dev version using MinGW after which I noticed unexpected failures popping up elsewhere, so the compilation process may not have been good. I will also try building with Visual C++. In any case, the original problem of taking the mean when the data is all within one period is still outstanding.\n"
