I've got my own ideas, but would appreciate some more feedback on what others feel this should look like before I get any deeper on this, as follows:\n- Table style or dictionary style? Personally favor table, but both could be effective.\n- Assumed knowledge? (ie assume some familiarity with pandas, numpy etc, or that they have not done the 10min exercise?) I would like to make this as simple as possible without making the more experienced ones want to claw out their eyeballs, but have a statement at the top of the cheatsheet that refers users to the 10min exercise if they are new to pandas.\n- Include detail on how it works (e.g. a description of parameters), or what it does (e.g Series creates a 1D array), or both? My vote is for the what it does only - should be a quick refresher, not a detailed how-to.\n- Contain links to more detailed docs? This will be useful, but would also be more cluttered.\n- Where in the doc structure should this sit? \n\nRandom thought...Planet of the Pandas. Went to the movies and saw the preview for Dawn of the Apes. Incorporating Caesar's 'death unto you' expression and red war paint onto the face of a panda could make for an interesting logo.\n"

(http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.pdf) That is something I would love to see for pandas. You can even get the tex source of it if you are interested in that (http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Short-refcard.zip) \n\nI think you can assume some knowledge, as this is always an overview to easily find/remember things again for people already using pandas (a bit), and not a real explanation for new users.\n"
