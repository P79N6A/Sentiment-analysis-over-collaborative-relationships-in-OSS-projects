I generally do one error number at a time (using --select) and commit after each autopep8, then squash-merge at the end before pushing.\n\nAs a benchmark, I modified 6500 LOC in a 40K LOC never-pep8'd codebase in a day last week. The rest I did in vim: highlight a visual selection, then += to format.\n"
