    "body": "Let me be more explicit in my logic. I have events (indexed by time) and each event has a duration. For every event I'm interested in calculating the sum of the durations of all preceding events over a four hour window. I am also interested in excluding the duration of the present event from that running sum. Thus, I use the rolling method with closed='left'.\r\n\r\nSome events occur simultaneously, but they are not identical as they have different durations. Yet, they share the same prior events, and thus should have the same total duration of all preceding events. \r\n\r\nHowever, this is not the result that I get when I apply rolling. I get that simultaneously occurring events are treated as consecutive. If I switched their order I would get a different result, which is absurd. The total duration of all events preceding two simultaneous events should be the same, and the calculation should reflect that. \r\n\r\n"
