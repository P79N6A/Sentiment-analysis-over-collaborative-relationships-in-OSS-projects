    "body": "I think you could have a 2-level menu structure. But I wouldn't change the order much at all.\n\nThe most important part of the entire whatsnew is the very first page, the highlites, which allow one to jump to sections of relevance. Most people just jump around and don't read everything. Don't force one to go thru section by section (like the original whatsnew) and scipy etc, I think its a bad idea.\n\nThat said, I am pretty confident that the major backward incompatible changes are pretty clearly documented (via a warning box), where applicable in : Categorical, Timedelta, Index changes. Having these in a centralized section really doesn't serve much purpose. \n\nAnd makes it MORE confusing. E.g. we have a section on `Timezone API changes`. None of these themselves are API breaking per se, but changes in behavior (none of which are back incompatible). They are a mix of bug fixes and enhancements, but are grouped logically.\n\nNote that with the exception of Categorical which explicity warns you to audit your code etc. I don't think any of the changes in Timedelta, Index sub-classing are backward incompatible at all.\n\n.\n"

    "body": "About \"most people don't read everything\" -> fully correct, but that is my point a bit: the breaking changes are now spread throughout the whatsnew, so if you want to know what these are, you _have_ to read it all. For that, I think, a clear list of all 'real' breaking api changes would be helpful if you quickly want to skim through them to see if anything would be applicable for your personal code (i.e. \"if you possibly have to fix something when going to upgrade\"). Now there is no way to do this apart from going to all of the whatsnew docs.\n\nI don't think this will be more confusing. Eg about your example about the `Timezone API changes` section: if they are not breaking changes, ok, the better!, but so they will not appear in this list of 'breaking' api changes and can just sit in a timezone section in the enhancements section. I fully in favor of having some subsection grouping related fixes/enhancements by topic as we now already do (that would be subsections in the enhancements section in my proposal above).\n\nI am not saying we do a lot of backwards incompatible API changes. It is good that the changes in Timedelta, Index subclassin, categoricals, etc are mostly backwards compatible. But then they also don't belong in such a breaking API changes section. And we should make it more clear that this is the case. By now having a large section 'API changes' we give the impression of having a lot of 'breaking' api changes (I know that is not the same, but then we can just call it enhancements instead of api changes to make this more clear)\n"
