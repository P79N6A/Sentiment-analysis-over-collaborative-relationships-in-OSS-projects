    "body": "So the PR on github I linked to seems to be the correct one. As I said there, the PR's intent was to parse something like `Timestamp('2012')` no longer by filling with current month and day of the month, but setting it to 2012-01-01 (and to make this consistent over the different the different parsing functions we have in pandas). \r\nSo that change was certainly intentional. The change that, when only supplying a time part, the date part is no longer filled with the current date, but with 0001-01-01, is possibly a side-effect we maybe didn't fully catch then."
