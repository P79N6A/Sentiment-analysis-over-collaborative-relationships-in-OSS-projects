    "body": "> how’s is the 3rd point true at all?\r\n> pytest path/to/test\r\n>is all you need\r\n\r\nThat is if you want to run one test/file in isolation.  But imagine you are working on a branch where some tests are causing segfaults and you want to run the test line-by-line, looking at objects in the namespace to see what is getting mutated when.  Then (yah yah, pdb whatever) you want tests code that behaves like normal non-test code.  Or for a more every-day example, which is clearer to the reader:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def test_td64ser_div_numeric_scalar(self, tdser):\r\n        expected = Series(['29.5D', '29.5D', 'NaT'], dtype='timedelta64[ns]')\r\n        result = tdser / 2\r\n        tm.assert_equal(result, expected)\r\n\r\n    def test_td64ser_div_numeric_scalar(self):\r\n        tdser = pd.Series(['59 Days', '59 Days', 'NaT'], dtype='timedelta64[ns]')\r\n        expected = Series(['29.5D', '29.5D', 'NaT'], dtype='timedelta64[ns]')\r\n        result = tdser / 2\r\n        tm.assert_equal(result, expected)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI claim the latter is clearer by a wide margin."

However, I don't agree that we should restrict the use of singleton fixtures and I don't agree that we should undo work done on fixturizing tests.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming that many of the fixtures are a result from the transition away from unittest style classes with setup methods. My opinion is that creating a fixture is a straightforward way to achieve this. Also as part of the transition test files are being split into a hierarchy of directory based tests. So my reasoning would be that a fixture placed in a confest file at the appropriate directory level is preferable than adding functions to util.testing. Hence why I would not like to see restrictions on their use."
