    "body": "I don't know if it is really a bug, but certainly a restriction of the current implementation. But you are right this this restriction can cause a regression from existing code that worked in 0.13.\n\nFull explanation: as stated in the docs and the docstring (http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html#io-sql), `read_sql` is just a wrapper around the actual functions `read_sql_query` and `read_sql_table` (since the sqlalchemy refactor). \nSo if you certainly want a query, the recommended functions (starting from 0.14) is actually `read_sql_query` to be explicit.\n\nBut I agree that this restriction in the delegation in `read_sql` (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/io/sql.py#L377) is a problem, and not thinking about stored procedures was an oversight. I thought I first had an implementation without this `if 'select' in ..`, but I can't remember exactly the reason why in the end I thought this was needed. I should look at that again.\n\nThanks for the report!\n"

So it was changed to keep the deprecated mysql legacy working. But there should be another way to circumvent this.\n"
