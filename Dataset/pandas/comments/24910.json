    "body": "> having to convert everything to float because of nan?\r\n\r\n@fakio : If one element is `nan`, all elements must become float.  That's just how the internals of the arrays work from `numpy`.  Thus, that's why you get the lossy nature as I alluded to [above](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/24910#issuecomment-457339811).  I was asking you whether you would be okay with that as an end user.\r\n\r\nAnother limitation from the `numpy` world is that there are numeric limits to the numbers you can pass in.  Those limits are `np.iinfo(np.int64).min` to `np.iinfo(np.uint64).max`.  This would address why numbers like `+/- 100000000000000000000` can cause issues.\r\n\r\nThat being said, your examples do point to some issues:\r\n\r\n* We should be documenting that we can accept scalars for `pd.to_numeric`, which is not in the docs but is accepted in the implementation.\r\n* The consistency of behavior between `100000000000000000000` and `[100000000000000000000]`.  That looks buggy to me..."
