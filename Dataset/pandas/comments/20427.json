    "body": "so masked arrays are converted automatically for DataFrames, but I guess not for Series. We should just do this. A foreign ndarray like this doesn't have enough support to be a first class object in pandas (not too mention its too complex and to be honest not worth it, does anyone use masked arrays?)\r\n\r\nSo would take a PR to convert masked arrays for Series."
