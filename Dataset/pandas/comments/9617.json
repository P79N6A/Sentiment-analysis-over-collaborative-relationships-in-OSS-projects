    "body": "This really seems a like a gray area to me as far as standard Python exceptions go:\n- AttributeError: Raised when an attribute reference (see Attribute references) or assignment fails. (When an object does not support attribute references or attribute assignments at all, TypeError is raised.)\n- TypeError: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type. \n\n(Note that the only case I could find for the parenthetical remark about TypeError is when attempting to set an attribute of the built-in `object`. `Series` pretty clearly does not fall in this category.)\n\nTo me, the error from `Series([1, 2, 3]).cat` is closer to \"an attribute reference fails\" than \"an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type\" (is attribute lookup an operation or function?), but really I can see a case being made either way.\n\nWhat tips me in the direction of AttributeError is that it plays much more nicely with `hasattr` and `getattr`, which exist and will be used like `getattr(s, 'cat')` whether we encourage it or not. Duck typing is a pretty standard way to do things in Python, and we've had at least two reports from categorical users of using these methods. Plus, it enables a nice safe way to check for Categorical dtype (unlike `s.dtype == 'category'`).\n\n@JanSchulz - we jumped through some hoops to ensure that `Series.cat` works and `Series().cat` should not (see #9322). I agree that ideally `s.<tab>` should not show cat for non-categorical arrays. I think we discussed this in #9322 and decided against it only because the value seemed marginal and implementation would be a little messy (involving some hacks to `Series.__dir__`). But we can revisit that if you think it's important.\n"
