Eg I would leave this PR just as a PR to fix `cut/qcut`\n"

    "body": "@JanSchulz some feedback on the `ENH: let Categorical.reorder_levels also remove levels` commit. I think that is a nice feature, but I don't know I would use that as default. In a sense that, if I only want to 'reorder' the levels (the 'core' functionality of the function), it would be nice that the function warns me when I eg forgot a level. Now it will silently drop those. \n\nSo just spawning ideas:\n- have a `strict` keyword (or other name), that if `True` -> only same length is allowed, and if `False` -> you can also add/remove items in one go. If this would be True by default, then such removing of levels by accident cannot happen, as the user should set this to False to specifically say: 'Yes, I want to add/remove levels and I am myself responsible to check that I provided the correct items'. The error message when this kwarg is True could also point to set it to False.\n- have seperate functions like `add_levels`, `remove_levels` and keep `reorder_levels` as is. Or maybe these would be useful as such, regardless of this discussion. Because, if you just want to add or remove a level (without reordering in the same time), this could be simpler as using `reorder_levels` where you also have to specify the others.\n"

I really don't like the idea of adding a method per action (remove, add, reorder, rename) which in the end would all be some kind of \"prevent side effects\"-checks and then call some kind of method which would be like the current `reorder_levels()`. So the current end result is:\n- `reorder_levels( ... strict=True)` -> can only reorder levels, will check that the set of new levels are the same as the set of current levels\n- `reorder_levels( ... strict=False)` -> can reorder levels,  including adding new ones (will be unused) or remove some (will become `-1` = NaN)\n- assigning to `levels` -> renames levels, can be used to remove/add levels from the end of the list.\n\nI'm actually considering to make assigning to levels stricter, so that it only can rename, without the possibility to add/remove levels.\n\nAnny comments?\n"
