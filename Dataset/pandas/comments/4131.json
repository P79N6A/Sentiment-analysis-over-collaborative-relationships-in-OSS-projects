    "body": "@jtratner This fixes the problem perfectly and other potential kwds missing from upstream functions. I'm extremely impressed with the quick commits.  On another note, I noticed that because this doesn't specifically add the keyword argument, the feature is not as visible through ipython [tab completion](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/tutorial.html#tab-completion) and [introspection](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/tutorial.html#exploring-your-objects).  However from my perspective, the main issue is closed.  Maybe I'll tackle those niceties myself.  Thanks.\n"
