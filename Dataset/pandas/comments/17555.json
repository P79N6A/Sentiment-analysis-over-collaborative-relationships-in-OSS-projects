But its a clean build, which the entire point of CI. What I am talking about are incremental changes in development. Imagine you are in a branch and you make a change and you recompile, great. Then you switch to another branch, since the deps are not setup correctly, you have to either: a) recompile everything slow, or b) the recompile is not correct and you get weird errors.\r\n\r\nWith incremental deps things just work. My point is that you can't simply change deps w/o testing them like this. Since we rarely change them this is generally not an issue. If you are going to try to change them you need a metric for whether your change is good or not, so that it works in dev & production (which is what we are basically testing on CI).\r\n\r\nnot averse to adding some kind of incremental build for dev on CI, but I think its quite hard to do right."

    "body": "> Or how about _libs.window which has both from skiplist cimport [...] and `include \"skiplist.pyx\". Why are those not redundant?\r\n\r\nso this is slightly different; include is a source file include, so whenever ``window.pyx`` needs to be recompiled, the ``skiplist.pyx`` is added to the source file and recompiled. It *should* have a dependency on this. \r\n\r\nThis is a similar pattern to ``lib.pyx`` which *includes* ``inference``, ``properties`` and such.\r\n\r\n> So what about, say, tslib which cimports from khash. khash is not mentioned in tslib's ext_data entry. Does tslib not need to be re-compiled when khash changes?\r\n\r\nkhash is a dep of almost everything that is a dep of hashtable (a couple of cases where it is used directly). So in that case if hashtable will change if khash changes, and deps of hashtable will also change.. So nothing actually needs to depend on khash directly, except for hashtable itself.\r\n\r\n"
