I am using PyTables for storage and  PyTables does not support unicode but only utf-8 encoded strings. \nhttps://github.com/PyTables/PyTables/issues/151\n\nThe performance of encoding unicode Series to utf-8 is pretty bad  and would hit reads/writes of the format I am using in a pretty annoying way.\nAnother question I have would be about memory usage. Are Unicode objects \"bigger\" since they are decoded UTF-8 strings (for character sets like cyrillic etc)?\n"

I wouldn't worry.\n\nAre you sure you'll be impacted? are you using very large datasets, encoded with something \nother then ascii/utf-8, which contain mostly strings rather then numbers, have no issues with\nthe current state of unicode in pandas, and are already using the c-parser branch (or else you\nwould get a big speed bump when cparser lands in master, even if this were integrated)?\n\nIf that's the case, it would be helpful if you could put up an example dataset of the kind of data\nyou care about, so that future PR can be tested against real-world cases.\n\nIMO, even the worse-case is not that bad, but i'm sure others would disagree.\n\nAs to memory, I have no numbers right now, but I certainly would expect some overhead.\nThis was prompted by the disappoinitng perf of #2104,  and so was focused on cpu.\n\nI know py3.1/3.2 are particularly bad when it comes to unicode overhead, with 3.3 coming back to \npy2.7 levels. I'll look into it when I get a chance.\n"
