This is not a concern for `move` in py3 because strings are unicode type, and this function only accepts bytes type. I found this by thinking about ways to mutate string objects with tools like `np.frombuffer` and thought that I could try to craft bad inputs to this which would give me a mutable string. Nothing broke, this was just the result of some experiments.\n"
