I tried to repo by creating a similarly featured file (i.e. an empty first column) with Numbers (on mac) and saving it as XLSX, but that didn't produce the problem. So if you have access to Excel and can try to repro, it's simple to create a file with an empty 1st column (i.e. no header, no data)\r\n\r\nif that works, then it must be something else that is off with this file I have, but I don't know how to figure out what is wrong with it."
