    "body": "Hi @jschendel and @gfyoung and thanks for your interest in LGTM! I am one of LGTM devs and a big user of pandas so would love for you to give it a go.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell: what sets us apart is our query language technology [QL](https://lgtm.com/help/ql/about-ql) that allows us to find complex issues with a low false positive rate. You can write your own queries in QL to look for anything you might be interested in (see for instance [here](https://lgtm.com/help/ql/python/pointsto-type-infer) for a tutorial on points-to analysis).\r\n\r\nAt the moment PR integration means the standard set of queries is run but you can [customise](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/configuring-lgtm-analysis-project) what is analysed and turn queries on and off. And very soon it will be possible to add custom queries to the PR checks.\r\n\r\nIn addition to scikit-learn and numpy, matplotlib is also using it - and I hope scipy will join soon too :)\r\n\r\nI see @jschendel has already been using lgtm.com but I'm happy to answer any questions you have!"
