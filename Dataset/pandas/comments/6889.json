I'm looking forward to helping out where I can in the future.\n\nI added a section to `io.rst` explaining the options that aren't supported in the C parser and introducing `ParserWarning`. Also added notes to the docstring that `skipfooter` is unsupported in the C parser and `dtype` is unsupported in the python parser and updated the release notes.\n"

But the example you show in the PR description (first point of the summary of changes: 'Warn (new class ParserWarning) when C-unsupported options cause a fallback to python'), is about falling back, not about ignoring a provided keyword argument.

I guess that before we added the `sep='\\s+'`->`delim_whitespace=True` translation it made sense to warn the user in that case at least, since there was an equivalent option that didn't require a fallback. But for the other C-unsupported options like `skipfooter` I don't think it makes sense to warn unless there are also C-only options specified that would then be ignored. (Maybe a ValueError would even be more appropriate in this case?)\n\nSo maybe when a C-unsupported option is detected we can scan for python-unsupported options (and vice-versa) and only if one is found raise a warning/error?\n"

    "body": "@jreback OK, this is done and I'm working on getting the tests to pass again. Before we were leaving the tests that fall back in `TestParsers` with the assertion that they produced `ParserWarnings`, but with the new behavior they should instead raise `ValueErrors` since the various test classes specify `engine`. I'm inclined to just remove these tests completely from `ParserTests`, leaving a stub with `pass` and a comment linking them to the corresponding tests in `TestPythonParser`. Does this sound reasonable?\n"
