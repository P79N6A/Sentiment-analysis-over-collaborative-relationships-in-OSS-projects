    "body": "With this [matplotlib commit](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/commit/24cf3754962a060ae6923baf5bd8d51ab8c9d228) (I think for matplotlib 1.3.0+), there's better microsecond resolution handling with the default matplotlib.dates.AutoDateLocator than PandasAutoDateLocator - the matplotlib locator can plot ticks in units of microseconds while the pandas locator doesn't plot ticks with resolution better than milliseconds. It would be nice to either update PandasAutoDateLocator to account for this or [not set this locator as the default](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/2579) when pandas is imported. (Should I raise this as a separate issue?)\n"
