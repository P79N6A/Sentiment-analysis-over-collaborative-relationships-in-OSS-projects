    "body": "I've started working on this, but I'm not sure whether I should really be adding the import to _all_ files.  I'm not worrying about Cython files for the moment, but for Python files the options seem to be:\n- Add future division to all files that currently use division. There are a couple of libraries out there\n  that do this automatically, like `future` and `lib3to2`.\n- Add future division to all files that have any significant content, i.e. not `api.py` or `__init__.py` files.\n  Can be done by adding new fixes to the `future` or `lib3to2`. I've got a fix that does this at the\n  moment but it's a bit of an ugly hack.\n- Just add it to everything for consistency, including `api` and `__init__`\n\nI've got a very simple test script to check which files don't have the import:\n\n``` python\nimport os\n\n\ndef find_future_import(py_filename):\n    future_import_found = False\n    with open(py_filename) as lines:\n        for line in lines:\n            if line.startswith('from __future__'):\n                if 'division' in line:\n                    future_import_found = True\n    return future_import_found\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk('pandas'):\n    for filename in files:\n        base, ext = os.path.splitext(filename)\n        if ext == '.py':\n            future_present = find_future_import(os.path.join(root, filename))\n            if not future_present:\n                print os.path.join(root, filename)\n```\n"
