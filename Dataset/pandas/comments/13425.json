As it will only do something when there is actually a conversion from object dtype to integer dtype.\n\nOf course it could be easily changed that the keyword is also used when the dtype is already numeric (the `if com.is_numeric_dtype(values): pass` at the moment). \nBut, after second thought, I am actually not sure if `to_numeric` is the appropriate place for this functionality IMO. As then you would feed integer data to `to_numeric`, not to \"convert it to numeric dtype\" (the current purpose of the function), but to downcast them (which broadens the scope of the function). And it feels this should actually belong in a separate function.\n"

    "body": "@jreback : Oh!  That's not how I interpreted @jorisvandenbossche question (it seemed like he was whether we could replace e.g. `compact_ints=True` with `downcast=True`).\n\nYour interpretation is interesting though.  I think the important detail for `to_numeric` is that you can't \"downcast\" to any `dtype` as you can with `_possibly_downcast_to_dtype` (e.g. you wouldn't cast to `datetime` in this function).  Therefore, we would have to do validation to ensure that we were only getting numeric dtypes.\n\nSo something along the lines of:\n\n``` python\n... # validation to ensure that np.dtype(downcast) is a numeric dtype\nif downcast is not None:  # maybe check to make sure that \n                                        # values.dtype != np.dtype(downcast)?\n   values = common._possibly_downcast_to_dtype(values, downcast)\n```\n"

Its possible lots of cases are not tested as current the downcaster is all internal and called from appropriate blocks (so its implicity safe).
