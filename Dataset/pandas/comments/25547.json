The resulting axis will be labeled 0, â€¦, n - 1. This is useful if you are concatenating objects where the concatenation axis does not have meaningful indexing information.

    "body": "Oh sorry, hadn't noticed the part about _concatenation_ index in the documentation. Although I think it would be nice if there were an option that would be equivalent to reseting the indexes (`df.index`) in each input before concatenating - at least for me, that's what I usually want to do when using `concat` rather than `merge`."
