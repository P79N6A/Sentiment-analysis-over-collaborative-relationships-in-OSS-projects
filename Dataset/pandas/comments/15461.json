Please be both a bit more patient with each other.\r\n\r\nIf I understand the issue here, the thing is that now the kwargs are passed, and before they were not (so as a result, silently ignored). And those kwargs are not (fully) tested with a SparseSeries. \r\nBut at the same time, @jreback you are OK with the approach in this PR of handling things to `super(SparseSeries, self).reindex(..)` ? And this fixes some bugs? \r\nIf that is the case, let's go forward with this approach, but just not yet pass all the kwargs (just keep ignoring them) until someone adds tests for them? That seems like a simple way forward for this PR?\r\n\r\n@toobaz Would you still like to make that small change? (not pass the kwargs, or ony pass those for which you added tests) Then I think we can certainly merge this?\r\n\r\n\r\n> leave untested only an argument of which (even in the Series case) I can't even find a working example, let alone an unambiguous documentation.\r\n\r\n@toobaz about which argument are you talking here exactly?"

    "body": "Thanks to both for looking again into this.\r\n\r\nThe only (as far as I can see from the docs) untested argument is ``level``, so if there are other \"_addtl kwargs_\" I'm missing, please name them. ``level`` is (as far as I can see) untested also for regular ``Series``, and the documentation is unclear (to me at least). It is _not_ ``NotImplemented``, it is not _tested_ (again, to the best of my ``grep``ping), for ``SparseSeries`` exactly as for ``Series``. For ``SparseSeries``, before, it _was_ a bug. Now, being still not tested, it _might possibly be_ buggy. As stated above, I would be happy to take care of it in another PR, so that this one can finally be merged. That said, if in the meanwhile you want me to raise ``NotImplemented`` for _that specific_ argument - even though _before_ it was not implemented, while now we have _no specific reason to think_ it won't work, sure, I can do it.\r\n\r\n(Then my problem is clearly more general. In my PRs, I see more and more often 1) multiple subsequent revisions asking for things which were not previously asked 2) comments showing zero attention to my replies/to the code being discussed 3) the assumption that every missing test is my responsibility, even though ironically **none** of my PRs **ever** extended the pandas API, and all those that fix bugs do provide related tests. I'm not asking you two to open a general discussion on this, I'm just explaining the reason why I will not be able to spend 2 weeks on getting each trivial bug fix merged: the fact that the time I spend on pandas is not paid doesn't necessarily imply I like to waste it. That's it, feel free not to reply, see you in the next PR, which I hope will see more a constructive conversation.)"

    "body": "> level is (as far as I can see) untested also for regular Series, and the documentation is unclear (to me at least).\r\n\r\nSmall example in the docs: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/advanced.html#advanced-reindexing-and-alignment. I think the *behaviour* of reindex(level=) is rather clear (and I also use it regularly), but agree that the docstring explanation is not .. (will open an issue for that). \r\nAlways difficult to find tests in our gigantic test suite, but: there are a few in `tests/test_multilevel.py` ([here](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/09360d80da730008a6a89f38f3780bb1d55f9e25/pandas/tests/test_multilevel.py#L136) and [here](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/09360d80da730008a6a89f38f3780bb1d55f9e25/pandas/tests/test_multilevel.py#L1926)), further also in tests/indexes/test_multi.py.\r\n\r\n> For SparseSeries, before, it was a bug. Now, being still not tested, it might possibly be buggy.\r\n\r\nI don't know anything of the sparse implementation, so I cannot assess whether it is likely to work out of the box or not. But in any case, this is enabling those keywords (i.e. introducing new functionality that was previously not possible to do), so best to add tests in such a case to assert it is indeed working. \r\nBut let's do that indeed in another PR (and let's open an issue for that), and let's just not pass the kwarg here (leaving the situation exactly how it was) or raise an error (that's the same to me)."
