    "body": "Thanks. Maybe I'm not making myself clear enough\n\nSay you start with a big DF and a list of its columns and assign a color to each column.\n\n```\nA = DF.columns\nC = ['r','b','g',...]\n```\n\nNow you do some manipulations to filter out unwanted columns, eg\n\n```\nA = A[:x]\nC = C[:x]\n```\n\nand in the end, you plot\n\n```\nDF[A].plot(color=C)\n```\n\nNow if x > 1, you won't have any problem, but it's possible x=1 and will result in the above error.\n\nI don't think it's the user's responsibility here to write an awkward check \n\n```\ncolor = C[0] if len(C)==1 else C\n```\n"

You scenario probably applied to other arguments besides\n`color`s.  I think it _is_ better to tell the user he is responsible then to selectively special-case some \narguments and not others. \n\nIt may be possible to make singleton dataframes work as expected here without touching\n`kwds`, PRs welcome.\n"
