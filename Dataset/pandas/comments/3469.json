I greped through the pandas/io/tests/ directory and I didn't see any references to fred.  Should I start a new file similar to the ones for yahoo and wb?  I can add some more tests while I'm in there too.\n"

    "body": "I added a check for if the name you gave is a valid FRED series name, and a test that goes along with it.  I'm worried that it will break if the St. Louis Fed decides to change their response to an invalid name.  But the way I coded it, it should only occur if we already failed to return a dataframe.  It's basically just a more informative error message.\n\nI'd like to take a crack at #3413, but I might not have time until later this week.  It should be something as simple as changing the fred branch of the main DataReader function to\n\n``` python\nnames = list(name)  # if string is passed for a single series\nreturn pd.concat([get_data_fred(name, start, end) for name in names])\n```\n\nI may let someone else handle the history rewriting.  Last time I tried that over on statsmodels, I think I gave Joseph a headache.  Travis is testing now.  I'll add the final bit and mark it as ready to merge when it's done.\n"
