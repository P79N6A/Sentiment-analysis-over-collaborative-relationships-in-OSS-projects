    "body": "the rolling processors are implemented as float dtypes for simplicity. having ones for integers is not very useful as most rolling things do some sort of computations that end up as floats anyhow. Sure there are ones that don't (but in general we also need padding, meaning NaN's for these rolls).\n\nYou could cast back, but its not entirely for free though can be done safely (e.g. see [here](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/core/common.py#L1243)\n\nso if you are interested in a PR for this, would take it.\n\nNote that rolling functions are not super friendly, see #8659 , so would love some contributions here!\n"

I need a little help completing the documentation since this is my first time contributing to pandas - I'll look for you comments on the PR to complete it. Thanks!\n"
