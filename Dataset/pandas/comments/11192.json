    "body": "[`n` is an instance property](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/tseries/offsets.py#L182) specify its length/span. I don't think user touch it actually though... \n\nFrom what I've seen, there is no function uses freq taken from `get_offset` as it is. Applying numeric ops (like multiplying freq mult) will results in copy. Thus, user ops should not affect to internal cache.\n\n```\npd.tseries.frequencies.get_offset('A')\n# A-DEC\npd.tseries.frequencies.get_offset('A') * 1\n# <YearEnd: month=12>\n```\n\nAbove repr difference is caused by `_named` property, which looks to be attached by [`_make_offset`](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/tseries/offsets.py#L2669). It is introduced in #5189 for repr backcompat. I don't think it is needed anymore (because user can't get freq from `get_offset`).\n\nMaybe we can cleanup freq-retrieving functions in `freqnencies.py` and guarantee user can't touch the internal cache.\n"
