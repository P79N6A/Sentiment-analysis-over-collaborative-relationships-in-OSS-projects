    "body": "@jorisvandenbossche I realized that the tests were failing because of a bug in pymysql 0.6.1 wherein calling `.execute` on a SQL string with multiple statements causes a mismatch in returned cursors.  See https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL/issues/157 .  This was fixed in pymysql 0.6.2.\n\nI know we are moving away from legacy mysql support, but I feel that as long as the support is there, we should make it as consistent as possible (this is also my thinking for adding index creation to the legacy APIs --- to try to keep it consistent with the sqlalchemy API, though I realize this is actually an enhancement).  It seems strange to me if legacy sqlite did create indexes in `to_sql`, but legacy mysql didn't.  What do you think about upgrading the pymysql requirement to 0.6.2 ? In this  case, the tests for this PR would pass -- as they do for me locally with 0.6.2 -- and both sqlite and mysql would have the same behavior.\n"

    "body": "For the sqlite fallback (or 'legacy', but that is actually a bad name), it is indeed important to keep it as consistent as possible, as this will stay in the future as 'fallback'. So in this regard, your work to add it INDEX to it in this PR is really good. \nThe mysql legacy will be removed in future versions, and is only there for backwards compatibility for the time being, so I don't think we should put time in improving it. That said, of course, if it's gets better by improving sqlite support, that is not a problem. However, in this case, it makes it only more complicated I think. Plus, `pymysql` 0.6.2 is rather recent (april this year, so only couple of months). So in that case, people using the deprecated mysql, will get maybe a 'better' `to_sql` function in pandas 0.15, but probably have to update their pymysql version to be able to use it. So in that regard, I would rather keep it 'as is' for mysql (raising the required version for something that is deprecated is a bit strange I think). What do you think? \nOf course, you could do a check for the pymysql version, and only doing it if the version is high enough, but that effort is not worth it I think.\n"

    "body": "@artemyk yes, I was also wondering that when reviewing your changes, but I don't really know what would be best. As having a multi-column index, this also restricts searching on the not-leftmost index compared to having seperate indices (as far as I understand).\n\nFor the duplication in `_get_schema_legacy`, I think this was originally done for mysql, because in principle you need a connection object to use the `PandasSQLTableLegacy._create_table_statement` function (and `get_schema` does not need a connection in legacy mode, it does need an engine when using sqlalchemy). But maybe this can be circumvented by 'fooling' it by giving it an in-memory sqlite connection.\n"

    "body": "I will look around but I do think it shouldn't be too hard to let `PandasSQLTableLegacy` be instantiatable without a connection.\nRegarding multiple indexes -- yes, creating a two column index (let's say `(A,B)`) would make searching on `B` slow (non-indixes).  On the other hand, create two one-column indices (as ew do now) would make searching on a conjunction of `A` and `B` slow (e.g. `A=='txt' AND B==10`).  I think the latter corresponds closer to how a multiindex functions in pandas.  I think if a user wants to have extra indices on, say, individual columns, perhaps this can be an extra option to `to_sql` or they can create those themselves after the fact.\n"
