    "body": "@klonuo Thanks for the comments.\n\nFor 2, I think that's a fairly simple fix, and if you want to submit a PR that would be most welcome. Otherwise I can put something up for v0.14.1.\n\nFor 1, we chose `recover=False` because with incorrect HTML `lxml` will actually _drop_ data and we decided that slower parsing was more acceptable than data loss. The problem with selectively applying restrictions is that if you lose data in the initial parse, there's no way to recover it.\n"

    "body": "@cpcloud Thanks for your prompt reply\n\nI think it's best if you could provide fix, as I'm not familiar with pandas coding rules or internals. I just browsed html module, as I was getting errors, while parsing manually with lxml didn't have problems.\n\nAs for 1, I reported what I find unfortunate. Again I don't know libxml2 internals, but from what I read recoverer should be pretty advanced feature. IMHO disabling it shouldn't slow the parsing, nor enabling it should drop valuable data, but lets assume you did tests before applying it. Still missing closing paragraph tag wont let me see the table ;)\n"
