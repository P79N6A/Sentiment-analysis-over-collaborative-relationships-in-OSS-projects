The best-case scenario is that the dateutil implementation can drop-in replace the `_string_to_dts` pandas [currently uses](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/_libs/tslibs/conversion.pyx#L288) for parsing these formats.  Since the current pandas implementation isn't fully spec compliant (as you mentioned in an issue somewhere), it isn't obvious how easy (or feasible) this will be.  So yah, advocating patience and thorough in-house testing/profiling.\r\n\r\nAs for pandas accessing dateutil internals, there are a couple of workarounds pandas uses that we can probably make unnecessary:  https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/_libs/tslibs/parsing.pyx#L207, https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/_libs/tslibs/parsing.pyx#L315\r\n\r\nNote the tail end of tslibs.parsing.dateutil_parse is almost identical to _build_tzinfo from dateutil#493."

In the short term people can pin their dependencies until they fix their fragile code. Worst case scenario, the library is BSD licensed, so there are no viral concerns from vendoring it.\r\n\r\nThat said, for some of the stuff where I'm actually *planning* on exposing it publicly anyway (`_tzparser`, `_timelex`), it might not be the worst thing in the world to go through a deprecation cycle. Still, the message is weird: \"This private method has moved, you shouldn't be using it in the first place, but if you must, pick it up from somewhere else now.\""

I understand why it's done in this case (and in fact I'm working to remedy that by exposing some of these in a way that I'm comfortable supporting), but at the end of the day any such private interface calls will necessarily be fragile. They're private because they're implementation details, not to be relied upon.\r\n\r\nIn any case, my point was mostly that the situation is what it is. DeprecationWarning won't prevent you from needing to update pandas if you want the latest `dateutil`, and most people won't see them anyway, so it seems like a lot of work do deprecate things that people shouldn't be using *anyway* (for this very reason).\r\n\r\nThat said, I'll try to go the deprecation route with some of the bigger things."

    "body": "@jreback It's not that it's deprecated so much as it was always private. It is an implementation detail of the public interface, which is the auto-magical `parse` function, so there is no supported replacement for it.\r\n\r\nBefore the end of the year, I'd like to make a pretty significant refactor to `parser.parse` (end of the year being the arbitrary time at which I'm going to switch to an LTS branch and a 3.x-only branch). I and @jbrockmendel both are very keen on exposing some of the actual details of `parse`'s auto-magical action for people not content to just consume anything that looks like a date, and part of that effort will probably be a public lexer/tokenizer.\r\n\r\nUntil then, I think the best thing to do would be to just vendor `_timelex` somewhere in your source tree. Presumably if you put it in a `.pyx` file, that would also make the lexing part a bit faster. Once the parser refactor is done you can start using the public interface for that if it suits your needs better - I'll ping pandas' issue tracker when that happens (though I'm sure @jbrockmendel will be on it since he's very keen on all this parser stuff and also on pandas)."
