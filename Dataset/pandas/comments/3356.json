    "body": "so this is 85 function calls in 0.11.0, vs 71 in 0.10.1. (55us vs 45us) (on my machine)\n\nwe added some code to make sure timezones on the keys are correct (in this case doesn't matter of course,\nbut checking takes a few calls)\nand some code to make sure correctness of timezones in the return index....\n\nproblem is the usual of adding paths for correctness and handling cases, versus optimizng the common path,\nwhich generally we really don't know (what the most common user input is)....\n"
