    "body": "Thanks a lot @TomAugspurger ! \n\nOne note on something above:\n\n> py.test discovers _Test\\* class (if they inherit from TestCase?), while unittest does not.\n\nMy understanding is that the only way to use pytest fixtures within a class is to _not_ inherit from `TestCase`. This can make it a bit more difficult to gradually transition, but you can use `autouse=True` on existing `setUp` methods, and the inheritance then isn't necessary.\n\nAnd pytest discovers tests in `Test*` named classes, not `*Test`, unless they inherit from `TestCase`. \n\nLet me know if that's unclear.\n"

    "body": "> factoring asserts can be in a later PR\n\nAgreed, the only asserts I've manually rewritten were in `src/testing.pyx` to get the tests to pass. I believe this is due to https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/645, which has been fixed and will be included in pytest 3.0 which is coming out soonish. They were targeting Europython, but pushed it back.\nI'll revert those changes and wait for pytest3 I think.\n\n@MaximilianR thanks for the heads about `autouse=True`, I'll check that out. My initial goal was to have the test-suite runnable by either nose or pytest runners. Then followup PRs could make use of pytest features.\nDoesn't look like I'll be able to achieve that though due to the nose generator tests.\n"

The actual error comes from trying to lookup `StataReader.DTYPE_MAP[0]`, which throws a KeyError (that we catch and re-raise).  AFAICT, the `0` is coming from a null byte `ord('\\x00') == 0`.\n\nI suspect the problem is at a higher-level, since this passes with the nose runner, and it passes on other parts of our build matrix with pytest: https://travis-ci.org/pandas-dev/pandas/builds/175935337 Any hunches would be appreciated, but no worries if you're stumped.\n"

Date conversion is not robust to locale changes, and so when the file date is written, instead of `24 Jan 2017 12:10`, `24 ???? 2017 12:10` is being writen, where ???? is some unicode that I can't quite decipher.  Because this is inserting an extra byte, the rest of the header conversion is off. \r\n\r\nWill need to either use a custom date converter for the month or to temporarily set the locale when writing stata files.

I *think* that the appveyor testing proves that I have things setup correctly, since we `cd` to the root (outside of the pandas repo), and `pd.test()` is still able to find the `conftest.py` correctly, since we use the `--skip-slow --skip-network` options. AFAIK, we don't have to change the setup.py or anything, since it's just a regular python file inside the package."
