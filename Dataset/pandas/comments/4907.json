It's not a big deal, I actually use the defaults for almost everything so this doesn't really bother me.\n\nAnd that's about all I'll say on that.\n"

    "body": "okay, that's fine. I'd like to add `from_object` (to allow you to create a dict and set a bunch of options at once) and make `options` support `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` just to clean things up.\n\nIn other words, allows you to do this (which is nearly equivalent to what the pandasrc would do in syntax, etc):\n\n``` python\nconfig.from_object({\n'io.excel.xlsx.writer': 'openpyxl',\n'display.max_rows': 80\n})\n```\n\nand this\n\n``` python\nconfig.options['io.excel.xlsx.writer'] = 'openpyxl'\nconfig.options['display.max_rows'] = 80\n```\n\nIs that okay? feels cleaner to me than a series of function calls.\n"
