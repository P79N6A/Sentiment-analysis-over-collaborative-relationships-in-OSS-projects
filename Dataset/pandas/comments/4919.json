    "body": "@jreback My thought is that Google Analytics actually has several APIs: Core Reporting (currently the only one implemented), MultiChannel Attribution, MultiChannel Interaction, and Management; so it would nice to have access the rest of the data as well.\n\nThe issue right now, is that the way some of the helper functions are implemented they're too specific to the Core Reporting API and won't generalize.  I.e. if `_get_col_names` was implemented as\n\n```\ndef _get_col_names(header_info):\n    return [x.split()[1] for x in header_info]\n```\n\nThe ga module would be in a better position to handle more GA APIs w/ the same code.\n"
