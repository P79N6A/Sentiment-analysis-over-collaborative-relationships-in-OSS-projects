I just added to the existing tests for that method and added a dropna kwarg + docstring to the code.\n\nFor dropna, I deviated from the normal true/false syntax.  Specifically, dropna= 'any' | 'all' | False.  If dropna evaluates to True, then call DF.dropna(how=dropna).  You might prefer to revert to normal True/False behavior...\n\nAlso, if I entirely misinterpreted what you meant by dropna to begin with, please let me know!\n"

    "body": "Hey @jreback,\n\nI bet I significantly misinterpreted what you were thinking, but here's my attempt to rephrase your idea...  Also, if you like this, let me know how we should take this to a next step:\n\n**Problem** (or my interpretation):\nWe'd like a way to write and collect large amounts of data into an HDFStore, and we need to write more data that fits in memory at any one time.  The existing append_to_multiple method requires one massive DataFrame, which takes up too much memory to be particularly useful.  \n\n**Possible Solution**:\nTo resolve this problem, we want to buffer an incoming data stream in memory and then periodically flush it to the HDFStore according to some specific configuration.  The incoming data stream could be smaller dataframes, or an \"infinite\" list of dictionaries (or whatever else DataFrames accept in their constructor).  The buffer should be flushed to the HDFStore whenever it reaches a certain size.  We can implement this buffer as a class with \"write\" \"flush\" and \"close\" methods.\n\nI've actually implemented this and would be willing to contribute it to pandas, if it's suitable for pandas.  On the other hand, I'm not sure this is a direction we all should be going.  What do you think?\n\nThe class I implemented (and regularly use) to write data to HDFStore looks basically like this:\n\n```\nclass BufferedHDFStore:\n    def write(self, dict_of_data):\n         validate input data, maybe?\n         append to an internal buffer\n         if internal buffer greater than X mb, flush to HDFStore\n\n    def flush():\n         Convert in memory buffer to dataframes and append to HDFStore\n\n    def close():\n         close the HDFStore\n```\n"

I would need some time to play around with this idea, though.\n\nRegarding how a buffered implementation is different from just periodically appending data:  I have a particular use-case in which the stream of dicts gets chunked into (buffered) lists of Series, and each list then gets converted to a DataFrame and finally appended to the HDFStore.  If the stream of dicts was already in the DataFrame form, then as you suggested, I wouldn't need build this BufferedHDFStore implementation.  On the other hand, I'm not completely happy with this solution, because something about it seems overly engineered.
