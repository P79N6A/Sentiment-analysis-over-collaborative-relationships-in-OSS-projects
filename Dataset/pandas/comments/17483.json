    "body": "@gokceneraslan : Thanks for this report!  This is a documentation issue.  When you pass in `infer`, that is interpreted as there being a header available.  For round-trip, you should pass in `header=None`.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the documentation for the `header` parameter could be improved to make these behaviors clearer to the user.  PR is welcome!"
