    "body": "I think I found the issue. \r\n\r\nMainly because:\r\n\r\n1. \"name\" is a column in df\r\n2. When agg is executed with \"func\" parameter as a dictionary\r\n3. In pandas.core.base.py line 543, it is trying to get \"name\" attribute from self(df). \r\n4. The \"name\" attribute is supposed to be a quick reference to the dataframe that is assign by user `df.name = \"my dataframe\"`. But now it is a pd.Series.\r\n5. df.name as pd.Series will trigger TypeError, and no result will be returned.\r\n6. So agg function will move on to execute self.apply() pandas.core.frame.py line 5828\r\n7. In apply function it uses df.agg() (go back to step 2) so an infinite loop is created.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be in step 3,4 (pandas.core.base.py line 543) apply additional rule to get \"name\" from self. \r\n\r\nAny comment is welcome!\r\n"
