And if we called `nanmean` and `nanstd` we would be creating (almost) the same mask three times, which is what I was trying to avoid.\n\nAlso, if you don't mask out the `np.inf`s they mess up the rolling-ness of the calculation, and everything will be `np.inf` or `np.nan` thereafter.

    "body": "@jaimefrio, I'm not sure how `ddof` would figure into the calculation of skewness and kurtosis, but I think it would be easy to support a `bias` parameter analogous to that in `ewmvar()`. Following the notation in the second page of http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2988433 (page \"184), I think the existing (`bias=False`) behavior is to calculate skew and kurtosis as G1 = K3 / K2^(3/2) and G2 = K4 / (K2^2), respectively. I'd then suggest that the `bias=True` behavior would be to calculate skew and kurtosis as m3 / m2^(3/2) and m4 / (m2^2) - 3, respectively. Though perhaps `bias=True` isn't the right way to refer to the latter, as m3 / m2^(3/2) isn't actually biased. At any rate, with these \"biased\" estimators you could then have simple consistency tests of moments on the lines of the existing `check that biased var(x) == mean(x^2) - mean(x)^2` in `_test_moments_consistency()`:\n\n```\n            mean_x = mean(x)\n            ...\n            for (std, var, cov, skew, kurt) in [\n                (std_biased, var_biased, cov_biased, skew_biased, kurt_biased),\n                (std_unbiased, var_unbiased, cov_unbiased, skew_unbiased, kurt_unbiased)]:\n                var_x = var(x)\n                std_x = std(x)\n                skew_x = skew(x)\n                kurt_x = kurt(x)\n\n                ...\n                if var is var_biased:\n                    # check that biased var(x) == mean(x^2) - mean(x)^2\n                    mean_x2 = mean(x * x)\n                    assert_equal(var_x, mean_x2 - (mean_x * mean_x))\n                    # check that \"biased\" skew(x) == third_moment / second_moment^(3/2)\n                    third_moment_x = mean(x**3) - 3 * mean_x2 * mean_x + 3 * mean_x**3 - mean_x**3 # should collapse last two terms to + 2 * mean_x**3\n                    assert_equal(skew_x, third_moment_x / (std_x**3))\n                    # check that \"biased\" kurt(x) == fourth_moment / second_moment^2 - 3\n                    fourth_moment_x = mean(x**4) - 4 * mean(x**3) * mean_x + 6 * mean_x2 * mean_x**2 - 4 * mean_x**4 + mean_x**4 # should collapse last two terms to - 3 * mean_x**4\n                    assert_equal(skew_x, fourth_moment / var_x**2 - 3.)\n\n```\n\nThere are probably typos in the above code, so caveat emptor.\n"
