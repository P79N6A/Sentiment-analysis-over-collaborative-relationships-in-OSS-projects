    "body": "Are those numbers microseconds? There was some microsecond-level overhead added in 0.13.1, which I've seen and tried to address, but it was agreed that shaving off several dozen (hundred?) of additional function calls might not be worth it, because that overhead didn't scale with container size. For example, on my 3.3GHz i3 one microsecond is about 6 function calls:\n\n``` python\nIn [1]: def foo(x): return x\n\nIn [2]: timeit foo(1)\n10000000 loops, best of 3: 149 ns per loop\n```\n\nFTR, there's a [pull request](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/6450) with a lot of big container indexing benchmarks, most likely including ones shown here. I remember it showing some unexpected slowdowns for datetime indices, but I haven't yet looked at them.\n"

The reason I noticed is that I have a program that updates a large number of pre-allocated time series and data frames date after date so the increase in time was noticeable. I understand this is not a huge issue but I thought I'd bring it up since I saw no mention of it elsewhere. For my application it did lead to a significant time increase (~1.7 times slower). \n"

The values I am updating are only known at time t and I must loop through all the dates one at a time. It is convenient to have the data in a pandas TimeSeries for my application, but perhaps a quicker data storage solution could work and I could create a TimeSeries on demand when necessary. Some testing will be in order.\n\nAlso, I will look at iat/at to see if I can get a speed improvement. Thanks for the help!\n"
