    "body": "@mcjcode Thanks for your work on this!\n\n+1 that all the methods now have help messages (didn't look at the implementation yet)\n\nBut I am not sure I also like adding them all to api.rst. I mean having seperate `DataFrame/SeriesGroupby` methods listed. It should be clearly documented that in practice you work with these objects, but listing all methods of both seperately seems also like a lot of repetition (in many cases, they are the same for both, and also the same for Series/DataFrame). Plus, some things are documented on `GroupBy`, other things on `DataFrame/SeriesGroupby` which also does not make it more clear. Another option is to also add these methods to `GroupBy` in the same way and document these?\n"

Now that it is defined as a property in the class, this is unnecessary.  I also extended the second test to nine other methods, ones that don't take a `skipna` parameter.\n"
