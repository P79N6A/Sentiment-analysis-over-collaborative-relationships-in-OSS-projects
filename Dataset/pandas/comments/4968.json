    "body": "It's a general issue with datetime comparison to integers not being consistent.  Further, `==` is not at all the same as `<=`. `<=` implies ordering, whereas `==` implies 'is the object at this position the same as the object at this other position'.  earlier @jreback and I were considering an idea where we would limit boolean comparisons (except for `==`) to objects of the same type.\n\nFor example, what would you expect for `1 <= date(2011, 01, 5)`?\n"
