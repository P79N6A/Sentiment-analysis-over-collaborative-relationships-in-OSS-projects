    "body": "this is telling you that you are trying to append a different dtype than you have in the table.\n\n`combine_first` changes the dtype to `float64`. This is by definition since their is the possiblity of nans.\n\nSince you are storing an `int64` column, appending with a `float64` column by definition will fail.\n\nThe way to make this work is either to have your original with `float64` dtype, or astype the result of the `combine_first` to `int64`.\n"
