Also from a documentation point of view it is very difficult to document all the parameters, as a lot of plot kinds have specific ones only for that plot type.\n\nBut, the latest evolution in pandas was actually in the _opposite_ direction. As lately, the separate `hist` and `boxplot` methods have also been added to the `plot` `kind` interface. See eg #7809\n"

    "body": "> I wonder if making plot both a callable and accessor is an option? plot() would work the same but also have methods with plot-type specific docs and call signatures i.e. plot.scatter. I would assume the methods would just wrap around plot.\n\nYes, this is not a bad option, although ultimately it would probably be cleaner to have the base plot method wrap the specific types, e.g.,\n\n```\nclass SeriesPlotter(object):\n    def __call__(self, kind='line', **kwargs):\n        return getattr(self, kind)(**kwargs)\n```\n\n\"only one obvious way to do it\" is great, but pandas leans a bit more toward practicality.\n"

    "body": "I like the idea of having specific plot functions attached to `plot`, so `plot.scatter`, `plot.bar`, while still being able to call `plot(kind=...)`.  Would allow specific docstrings (excellent for knowing exactly which keyword args are relevant to the current type), tab completion etc.\n\nIf we could divide the plot types into categories like shoyer suggested that would be good too, but the proposed categories don't seem all that obvious/intuitive to me. I wouldn't have thought of a bar chart as a 1D plot (although it makes sense now that I think about it), and isn't line is either 1D or 2D depending on whether we're plotting with the index as x-axis or using a second variable? Would probably create a decent amount of confusion for people who know which kind of plot they want to find their way through to it.\n"
