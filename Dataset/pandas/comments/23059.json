    "body": "The root of the issue goes back to `cast_from_unit` in https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/_libs/tslibs/timedeltas.pyx#L275, so it could very well affect other types.  This is a classical case of representation error, but I think that we should represent the fractional second that was intended.\r\n\r\nOne thought is to use the decimal module here:\r\n```python\r\ntimestamp = Decimal(str(ts))\r\nbase = Decimal(<int64_t>ts)\r\nfrac = timestamp - base\r\n```\r\nIt does the job, but there is a performance penalty.  Currently:\r\n```\r\n%timeit pd.to_timedelta(pd.Series([ts]*10000), unit='s')\r\n28.1 ms ± 873 µs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)\r\n```\r\nversus using `Decimal`:\r\n```\r\n%timeit pd.to_timedelta(pd.Series([ts]*10000), unit='s')\r\n44.9 ms ± 1.9 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)\r\n```"
