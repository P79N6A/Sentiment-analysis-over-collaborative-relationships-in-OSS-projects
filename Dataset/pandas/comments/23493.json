    "body": "> [Tom] I thought we were all on board with the goal of the DatetimelikeArray.init being no inference and no copy.\r\n\r\n@jbrockmendel you have to see my comments in the same light. I was assuming we had this discussion and agreed on the design of the constructors, so I was wondering why we couldn't already follow that decision in this PR instead of deferring to a follow-up. \r\nSo this mis-assumption might have made things more frustrating than needed for *both* of us.\r\n\r\n> Your attention has been specifically requested in #23514, whereas I am finding it increasingly frustrating.\r\n\r\nJust as for Tom, this PR (and all issues related to the EA refactor) is high on my priority list, so I will still put time on this topic (which is more than writing comments here). \r\nSo you can expect a lot more comments to come (not necessarily now, but when you had the time to update the PR). But please don't see this as a bad sign, but rather as an opportunity to move forward quickly (and as an indicator of the importance of this refactor). Tom's PRs on the SparseArray and PeriodArray also saw a huge amount of comments and discussion, but I think that significantly improved the PRs and moved us relatively quickly to a shared understanding. \r\nAnd to be clear, it is no problem that it takes some time to process those comments.\r\n\r\nIf you have specific feedback on how I can make my comments less frustrating apart from the above, I am honestly all ears.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBut indeed, let's first try to build consensus on the fundamental design questions. I would propose to not do that here on this PR but on the general issue https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/23185 and the constructor split-off issue https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/23212, so we can keep the discussions in this PR on technical implementation details of things we in general already agree on.\r\n\r\nI would personally propose to have a chat about this, as a more effective way to discuss things. But @jbrockmendel, I think that only makes sense if you can fix the audio issues we were having last time. If that is not possible right now, I would propose to do it on chat at a given time to at least have it a bit more interactive than on github."

At this point I think the short-term solution is for me to take a half-step back and disengage.  The request that you do the same was primarily so you don't feel that I'm becoming non-responsive.\r\n\r\nMedium-run, I very much think the priority should be getting enough of this in place that we can get the tests working.  Later if you want to implement `datetime_array` mirroring `period_array` or rename `__init__` to `_from_sequence` (I'll be renaming `_from_sequence` to `_from_objects` or something) then that will be _entirely trivial_ to do.\r\n\r\nI'll be going AFK (at least on this thread) for a few hours."

Without the bugs being fixed, we can't institute meaningful tests for the array classes.  On the other hand, whether we rename `__init__/_simple_new` to `_from_sequence/__init__` can absolutely be postponed until after we have a fully-working implementation."
