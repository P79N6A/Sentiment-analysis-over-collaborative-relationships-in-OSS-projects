    "body": "This has created one other problem - since the writer expects columns to have string names, I am now converting columns to have unique string names, no problem.  However, if someone tries to use `{0:'tc'}` to convert column 0 to a date, then there now is a new problem.  \n\nThe solution as it now stands would be to check for this too and to convert to `{'0':'tc'}`, which would allow the rest of the code to run without further modification.  However, the variable name `'0'`  is also not legal and so it is converted later to `_0` in a different step.  Assuming that the magic shoudl be preserved, then it would make sense to do all of the at once so that the dataframe is known from the beginning to only have legal variable names.\n\nI can fix the date conversion issue too, but am starting to wonder if it might be more appropriate to raise an `InvalidColumnName` exception with an explanation rather than performing lots of magic behind the scenes.    If you think this is better (explicit vs now implicit) then it will require refactoring some tests too.\n\n@jseabold @jreback Any thoughts on magic vs. error?\n"
