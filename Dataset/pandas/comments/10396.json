    "body": "This is a cython conversion of the timedelta parsing routines. Was much more involved that it looked, as the original was using regexes, this is a string parsing state machine in cython.\n\nHowever, I think this could actually be done in c (or maybe using `char *` pointers in cython), rather than the list build up. This could be another 10x perf improvement on this (my benchmark is the c parser for ISO datetimes).\n\nif any of the c gurus are interested, pls comment!\n"
