    "body": "if you're just tinkering around with an h5 file then you're probably right about the use case.\n\nbut if you have huge frames that are related in some way (this basically describes all of the data of the entire field of neurophysiology and i imagine many other sciences as well) i think storing multiple data sets per file is more common. personally, i tend to store \"related\" data frames (e.g., a collection of experiments related by something like the age of an animal or the experimental condition or something like that) in a single file and then i have CSV file that i read into a frame that i use to basically index into the collection of h5 files, a sort of poor man's scientific database. \n\ni would rather be forced to provide a key and get an error when i didn't than accidentally overwrite a bunch of data because i forgot to put a key.\n\nI'm not sure if i'm misinterpreting what you wrote above but as for `to/read_csv` you just shouldn't have more than a single frame per file because there's really no general way to tell the two frames apart without just introducing a new serialization format that is _not_ CSV, and so it's difficult to say \"`to_csv` doesn't require a key so `to_hdf` shouldn't\" because `to_csv` is a single data set format.\n"
