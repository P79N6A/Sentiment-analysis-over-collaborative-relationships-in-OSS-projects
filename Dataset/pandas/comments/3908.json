    "body": "Hi,\n\nI've managed to get around this by directly hardcoding the information in the ga.py file (/Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pandas/io/ga.pyc). I bypassed the account, web_property, profile and profile_id  'get' statements and entered them manually (I had tried some of these before but not all). \n\nStill not sure why it stopped picking these up automatically. As far as I know, my organisation's GA account hasn't been altered. \n\nApologies if this post was of no interest to anyone!\n"

    "body": "@DPCollins can this be closed? if you want to you can step through in a debugger such as `pdb` and I bet you'll find what the issue is pretty quick.\n\nAnother great feature of ipython is that if you have a script you can do `run -d my_script.py` and it will step through with a debugger from the start of the script. then you do need to explicitly put breakpoints in\n"
