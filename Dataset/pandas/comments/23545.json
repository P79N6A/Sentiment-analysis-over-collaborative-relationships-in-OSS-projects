I don't know what to say.\n     I am repeating:\n     It's just that one command.\n     pandas.read_html(html_file) is taking forever to give back a result.\nIf the html_file is more than 5 mb . If it's a few kbs it gives the result\nimmediately. It doesn't throw an error or anything.it takes more than 30\nminutes to give me the list of data frames .\n       I have been looking for a html page with table data but haven't been\nable to find any.the htmls I am using are official ones and have sensitive\ninformation.
