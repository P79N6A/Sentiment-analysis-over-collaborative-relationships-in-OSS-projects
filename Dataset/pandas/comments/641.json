I think that whatever you decide, perhaps being explicit, instead of having \"smart\" code, would perhaps be the best course of action.  For example, ix is only used for index look up and not for look up based on row number -- use a different function for that.  This would, however, require users to fix their existing code if they upgrade to the latest version.  Just a thought though.\n"

Before it would \"fall back\" on location-based indexing which would lead to very subtle bugs. \n\nI'm going to add some API functions for integer-only based indexing on the columns and the rows so that should help alleviate the ambiguity. Users shouldn't have been using location-based indexing with integer indexes anyway! It's kind of an esoteric use case imho but I'm sure that it does happen in practice...\n"
