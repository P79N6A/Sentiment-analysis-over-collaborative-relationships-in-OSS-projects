    "body": "@jreback While pad filling is convenient, I think it's quite dangerous as the default. \"Errors should never pass silently\" and all that Zen. Pandas often drops NaNs for convenience, but dropping NaNs when plotting (for example) isn't nearly as easy to overlook. In fact, I just told someone a moment ago that `pct_change` did *not* fill, which was completely inaccurate. Luckily I tested it and discovered otherwise. Reading the documentation or even checking parameters didn't cross my mind until I was surprised by the result.\r\n\r\nBackwards compatibility is important, too, but perhaps there's a chance this method could default to `fill_method=None`? The existence of this \"bug\" report suggests no-fill is more intuitive.\r\n\r\nFor comparison,\r\n```\r\nlag = series.shift(1)\r\nchange = (series - lag) / lag\r\n```\r\nseems like it would create the same results as `series.pct_change(1)` but the filling is a subtle difference.\r\n\r\nI haven't done a systematic survey of use cases, but in my experience, most time-series analysis would prefer no-fill. When fill-forward is desired, I'd expect that the fill would be done before the pct_change as a more explicit step."

    "body": "Hi guys, I think this issue should be re-opened. @selik is absolutely right that \"Errors should never pass silently\" and unless explicitly done so, this _is_ an error. Not technically, as the default is currently fill_method='pad', but that is not an answer. That is just stating the problem. Upgrading this to  fill_method=None is in now way different to deprecating inplace=True, or any other relatively major change that pandas has gone or will go through. "
