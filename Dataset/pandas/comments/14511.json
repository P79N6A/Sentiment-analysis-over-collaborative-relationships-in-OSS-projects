    "body": "@jzwinck That is indeed correct. Pandas will not directly replace Panels with something else if they are deprecated, as we believe that `xarray` provides a better and actively developed alternative. The mapping in functionality will not be 1:1 though.\n\nI will close this issue, as we will not probably actively work on enhancements to panels. You can always make a helper function for the 'verbose' way yourself.\n"
