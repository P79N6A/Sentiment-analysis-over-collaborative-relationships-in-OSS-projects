    "body": "@cancan101 Few things:\n1. Never assume your HTML is valid. In fact, it would be reasonable assume that it's _invalid_. [google.com has invalid markup](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fgoogle.com&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0). [Here](http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/mama-markup-validation-report/) is an interesting read on the validity of web pages. Only 4.13% of pages validated passed the W3C's validator.\n2. `lxml` doesn't behave in a sane way, for all cases, when it comes across invalid markup. For example, it will sometimes _remove_ a node instead of trying to keep it. That is, IMHO, a bad solution. `html5lib` on the other hand, tries very hard to keep everything.\n3. There isn't a meaningful way to assign an order to arbitrary HTML tables. You should define one if that's what you're interested in doing, but `read_html`'s result should essentially be treated as a `set`. There is an ordering but it depends on the order in which the underlying parser returns tables. That may or may not be consistent across parsers.\n\nSo, I don't see the ordering as a problem, but I'd be happy to document this.\n"
