    "body": "The initial bug report was using columns with no level names- if you have names I can see how `index._get_level_number()` helps you keep track, but without names I'm not sure how you can use it? The whole issue comes up because as you do the stacks one by one, the level numbers for the remaining levels change.\n\nThe existing behaviour handles the multiple levels case within `DataFrame.stack()` and just sends one level at a time to `core.reshape.stack`, I guess I could try to move the whole thing, including existing behaviour, over to `core.reshape.stack` if that's the most logical place for it?\n"

I've added test cases, but let me know if this is too many changes for a single PR.
