    "body": "`openpyxl direct` is how the snippet does it, based on the code you showed me at PyCon: just pass rows of data (so a Dataframe just needs expanding and transposing).\n\nI'd personally advise against any version of openpyxl < 2.2. I hope to add support for NumPy types in the soon to be released 2.3.\n\n2.0 & 2.1 make sense if you're editing a worksheet in place because they avoid the side-effects when working with styles. Otherwise the guards, used to avoid side-effects when working with styles, exact a huge penalty on performance.\n"

Switch to using to `write-only` (formerly `optimized-write`) mode?\n\nIn the current in-memory implementation we're actually still using a dictionary to hold the cells but I plan to move this using some kind of matrix structure. This could have several memory benefits and would also facilitate aggregate functions (deleting / adding rows or columns) and might also speed things up, but is essentially an implementation detail `write-only` could benefit from a co-routine.\n\nI've also tried looking at the xlrd reader code, because openpyxl's read support is more extensive but I gave up. Would be happy to work on something using `read-only` mode for fast, sheet-by-sheet access but I think that going from rows (here the implementation really matters) to typed columns is definitely \"tricky\".\n"

    "body": "@jreback I tried squash but wasn't sure what it was doing.\n\nImprovements on style handling can be done later. They're slow because the same style (cell with border) is being created over and over again. This can be avoided by having the style locally and just binding it when required: `xcell.border = CellWithBorders`. This will allow for future improvements like named styles which will just assign the name of a style to a cell and thus avoiding even the need to hash the style. But avoiding style object creation should be the biggest win.\n"
