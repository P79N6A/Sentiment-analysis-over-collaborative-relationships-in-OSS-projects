    "body": "I'm interested in contributing and thought this looked like a good place to take a first step.\r\n\r\nReviewing pandas/io/excel.py, it looks like the change needs to be made in the _should_parse function of the ExcelFile class. Specifically, here: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/1915ffc53ea60494f24d83844bbff00efa392c82/pandas/io/excel.py#L355-L360\r\n\r\nIt looks like the current implementation checks for an integer first (i.e. a max number of columns to use), a string second (i.e. assuming a comma separated list of column names in a single string), and assumes a list (technically any container that implements the \"in\" operator) otherwise. When a list is assumed for usecols, the check for the column index (i) assumes that it is a list of integers.\r\n\r\nThe simplest way to implement the requested functionality would be to add a new conditional to check whether the first element is a string and, if so, concatenate the list into a single string like case 2 and re-use the _range2cols function to convert to numeric values before returning the comparison:\r\n```python\r\nif isinstance(usecols, list) and isinstance(usecols[0], compat.string_types):\r\n    return i in _range2cols(', '.join(usecols))\r\n```\r\nAdditionally, there would probably need to be another check (if there isn't already?) to handle the behavior for an empty list. Should this be assumed to mean the same thing as None? It doesn't make sense to read a sheet and not return any data.\r\n\r\nIf we take this a little further, we could add support for mixed lists of integers and strings (if desired) by doing something like:\r\n```python\r\ndef _list2cols(area_list):\r\n    parsed_list = list()\r\n    for e in area_list:\r\n        if isinstance(e, int):\r\n            parsed_list.append(e)\r\n        elif isinstance(e, compat.string_types):\r\n            parsed_list.extend(_range2cols(e))\r\n        else:\r\n            pass # Assuming other types should not be considered\r\n\r\n    return parsed_list\r\n\r\nif isinstance(usecols, list):\r\n    return i in _list2cols(usecols)\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterested in feedback on which direction should be taken.\r\n\r\n"

What I mean is that I'm trying hard to have this issue solved but because of the lack of standard to review the changes every time there is something else to change in the commit making contributing to Pandas really awful and demotivating.\r\n\r\nDoes someone have a suggestion of what should I do about it? May anyone from Pandas core team  help me to find out what is the problem with the contribution I'm making?\r\n\r\nAlso, the behavior of `usecols` was redefined and it was created another keyword argument called `usecols_excel` to handle exclusively excel columns indexes as a string. So, the request to handle excel columns as a list of strings was revoked as you can see at the documentation of `usecols` and `usecols_excel` at https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/20480/files#diff-0153a977179cfc73a2645cf0b7cd1f7f"

    "body": "Throwing my two cents in:\r\n\r\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_excel.html\r\n\r\nSupporting lists of strings is not technically addressed in the documentation, so I'm a little hesitant to call this a bug as of the current version of `pandas` (`0.23.4`).\r\n\r\nThat being said, this issue does bring up a lot of questions re: how to handle `usecols` for `read_excel`, in particular, why its handling is so different from `usecols` for CSV:\r\n\r\n* Column ranges (e.g. `A:C`) - that's totally fine with me.  That's special to Excel.\r\n* \"If int then indicates last column to be parsed\" - We don't support this for CSV.  I don't see why we support this for Excel?\r\n* List-like support for Excel is pretty bad.  We don't support values like `usecols=[0, 1, 2]` or `usecols=['A', 'B', 'C']`, which I think we should.\r\n* We don't support callables for `usecols`, though I don't see why we shouldn't.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?"
