If we add one more build, we might\nas well add 5 more.\nKepping iterations fast really matters. a 25 minute build (we've been there, before wheels),\nmeans a DOC commit could mean the following one could take 50 minutes to green. \nYou might add the additional builds only in the run up week or two to a release. That would\nbe quite a good thing. If you want to add more regardless, that's ok too. I might grumble\nocassionally, no more.\n\ncc @cpcloud , some numexpr wheels are missing, If you get a chance...\n"
