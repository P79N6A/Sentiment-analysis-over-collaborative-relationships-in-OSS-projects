    "body": "@cpcloud I am looking to tackle this. My initial thought it to allow passing in \"user defined parsers\". The simplest solution would be to allow the flavor argument to be a \"`_HtmlFrameParser`\". \n\nA couple of questions/ thoughts:\n1) Should it be a subclass of `_HtmlFrameParser` (literally a type) or an instance of a subclass? Or allow either?\n2) Should `_HtmlFrameParser` be renamed to `Flavor`? Or maybe I should create an empty class called `Flavor` or `HTMLParserFlavor` that user implemented subclasses are expected to subclass. \n\nIn addition, I COULD add the ability to register the flavor so that the user can than use a string rather than passing in the class/ object itself. I am indifferent to this and am okay just passing in the class/object and no bothering about the string indirection. \n"
