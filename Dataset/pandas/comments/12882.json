    "body": "yeah I am pretty sure that `Categorical.sort` was supposed to be deprecated (IOW, it should actually be calling `.order` rather than `.sort_values`. It was added for method compat with Series/Index, and never actually exposed in api.rst.\n\nso @gfyoung pls change the doc-string, have it call `.order`, add a tests for the deprecation, and a note in the Deprecation section. It was a never advertised method, so I don't think this is a big deal.\n"
