(very welcome as I have still other work that I would like to do for the sql code)\n\nI have not yet begun to work on it, the problems just lies in the fact that the insert statement uses the frame's column names, and not the converted ones (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/62b4d6405c21cfd74b4e9e00c298648d6b2e2e82/pandas/io/sql.py#L442) as in the table statement (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/62b4d6405c21cfd74b4e9e00c298648d6b2e2e82/pandas/io/sql.py#L502))\n\nI would certainly default to do nothing, and maybe provide a keyword argument to do something else (remove space, to lower case). But the first is the priority I think.\n\nBut maybe it would be better that first #6735 gets merged. If you can take a look at it, please do.\n"

    "body": "An idea: could we do a quick check (when in legacy mode) if there are columns names with spaces? (the names which would have been converted previously) And then raise a warning, to warn the user that the behaviour changed and that the column names will not be converted anymore (and maybe hint how to do it themselves). Or would this just be annoying?\n\nI think this could help prevent surprises, but of course, once you've seen it and decide to keep using column names with spaces this can become annoying.\n"
