    "body": "I just saw this by mistake.  Seems strange you didn't send this to pandas-dev,\nor mention others. especially given a 24 hour ultimatum. Isn't that a little heavy-handed? \nDon't assume devs see every new comment on github. You know the BFDL doesn't.\n\nFirst, there's #5550 to get in before a feature freeze. Also, please be careful in choice of tags, you should maintain the total ordering on [dev versions](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/4046?source=cc) into the future.\n\nI completely agree there's a problem with the release process, that's largely the cause why\nthe 12.1 and 11.1 bugfix releases never happened I think. The current model may slow things down\nbut it does have the benefit of keeping things simple and functioning by design.\nFixing the release problem would go a long way towards making this unneccesary.\n\nHow will this work? will rc and the final release live on the same branch? \nif so the branch name is wrong. Where will 0.13.1 go? will there even be bugfix releases going \ninto the future? how do you maintain the backport queue and make sure things don't get missed?\nwho's responsible for backporting (the team? the PR submitter? an individual?)? what happens if no \none wants to?\n\nI'm not against it, just want to know there's a plan and hear what it is.\n"
