    "body": "If you have a `nan` in your index and it can be converted to `Float64Index` it will. Before #6879, the backend was using `object` dtype, which allowed checks for `nan` internally, but `isin` relied on the behavior of `Index` which uses `set`. If you look at the beginning of the issue thread, I was pulling my hair out trying to figure out why `nan` behaves like an object in some cases and like a large integer in others.\n\nHere's why: \n\nIt's because internally `nan` is represented as a large integer, but when you use it as an object, it's a pointer. When it's used as an \"object\" it's okay to use in a `set` and you'll get `True` if `nan` is in a `set` and `False` otherwise. If you use it like a float value, then each one is a different object (large-ish integers in Python behave like this as well). Of course, you can compare integers and other numbers so e.g., `1 == 1` is `True` and it would be in the `set` object. However, `nan` by definition has the property that `nan == nan` is `False` so comparison of `id` (address) returns `False` and so does equality and thus `set` membership is `False` for these \"different\" kinds of `nan`s.\n"
