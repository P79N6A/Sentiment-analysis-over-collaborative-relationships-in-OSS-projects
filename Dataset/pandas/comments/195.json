Longer term going to transition to datetime64 data type in NumPy instead of using Python date/datetime objects (which are slow for large time series)\n2. datetime and date are not intercompatible\n3. The DateOffset classes in pandas.core.datetools would all need to be modified and tested to work with datetime.date which would be a lot of work. \n"
