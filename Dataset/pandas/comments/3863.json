    "body": "I understand that they behave in this way because it is a method defined on datetime, but it just seems unintuitive that those functions are available on Timestamp but do not return a valid Timestamp at all. If they end up being used (to whatever purpose) they will likely cause subtle issues in indices or as column values (either turning into a NaT or the index/column being of dtype object).\n\nIMO it would be nice if they were overridden and at least warned the user of potential pitfalls. I think that the best solution would be that they return a valid Timestamp and adhere to the timestamp limitations. There is still room for subtle problems (e.g. datetime.min != timestamp.min), but perhaps less so than currently.\n\nIf the general opinion is that these functions should not be used on a Timestamp at all, then I would override them and make them raise an error. Currently the intentions are anything but explicit or clear.\n"

I suppose one could just try to construct the Timestamp and catch the resulting error (which then needs to be interrogated on why actually the construction failed).\n\nAnother use case might be when dealing with datasets going back beyond the 17th century (the current lower boundary), where one might want to use as much data as can be fitted into Timestamps and can then query the source with Timestamp.min?\n\nAdmittedly, I can't come up with a single golden scenario where this functionality is absolutely required.\n"
