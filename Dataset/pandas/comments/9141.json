    "body": "Looks like this is the same issue as #8728. The code is exactly the same. I can see in that issue that the existing code came right from Google's example, however the [API reference for getQueryResults](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/v2/jobs/getQueryResults)  regarding the jobComplete key states:\n\n> Whether the query has completed or not. If rows or totalRows are present, this will always be true. If this is false, totalRows will not be available.\n\nSo clearly we need to check the value of jobComplete before moving on to grabbing totalRows. The thread you've referenced at SO is regarding an issue with inserts, why is that holding up this unrelated change?\n"
