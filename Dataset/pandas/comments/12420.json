    "body": "so, I believe all of the issues w.r.t. threading are due to `numexpr<2.4.6` (there is another fix in 2.5 so might has well run on that. Further you have an older version of pandas. v0.18.0 coming shortly fixes even more issues. you can install via: `conda install pandas=v0.18.0rc1 -c pandas`\n\nI confirm this works on master on windows 3.5 with numexpr=2.5.\n"

    "body": "Thank you for your ideas. I performed all the upgrades you recommended. Unfortunatelly the problem just moved somewhere else. The snippet above already works correctly, but my code still crashes the interpreter. I spared quite some hours trying to create a new snippet to reproduce the bug, but I can still observe the behavior only in original codebase of my project. The bug is very sensitive to timing, e.g. when I add some printing to the suspicious parts of the code, the error is gone...\nI will post the new snippet as soon as I am able to create one.\n"
