Had to try a few variations, but eventually got the second label working, at least for my local build of the docs.\r\n\r\nNo real point in changing to URL in this case; I'll make it https but leave everything else as is.  Assuming this is fine, will check the docs generated by travis after this gets merged to make sure it's working there too.\r\n  "
