    "body": "@jreback @jtratner u guys want to look over this? Going to merge after passing\n\nI ran this on travis a bunch of times overnight (before the most recent commit) to see if i could trigger any errors, and nada. (only changes in the latest commit were refactoring)\n\nHere's a list of the important changes (in no particular order):\n- version independent (down to python 2.6) context managers for `ZipFile` and `urlopen` (thanks @jtratner!)\n- refactored all repetitive code into single functions, e.g., `_retry_read_url`, `_dl_mult_symbols`\n- `NaN` is now returned when a symbol cannot be found in `_dl_mult_symbols`, so that the shape remains the same, a la the GIGO principle (thanks @jreback)\n- I've added a test that checks to make sure that if any symbols failed the column with that symbol name contains all `NaN`s _and_ also checks that matches up _exactly_ with the symbol names in the warning message.\n- unified the API such that `kwargs` is no longer used anymore as there was no need for it\n- things that should be skipped are now skipped, I see the skips occasionally on my machine we'll see about travis\n"
