This is a common form of abuse (redis, magnet links, db DSN's also borrow this syntax, e.g. postgres).\n\n``` python\nIn [3]: from urlparse import urlparse\nIn [4]: urlparse(\"s3://bucketname/my/path/to/data.csv\").scheme\nOut[4]: 's3'\n```\n\nThe python standard library considers this reasonable.\n- The AWS docs you quoted cannot differentiate between a user trying to load a public HTTP(s) asset\n  which just happens to be served from s3 vs loading a private asset which uses HTTP(s) but requires authorization. That's the reason for using the `s3://` scheme.\n- Adding a test would require putting a private bucket up and sharing (IAM) keys to it. The code merged was minimal and I was satisfied with a smoke test.\n- The reason for merging was being useful and small at the same time.\n- Practically everyone who develops in AWS has those envars defined in their .profile as they are \n  the same ones used by the official CLI tools and their clones and client libraries which access \n  AWS services, boto is one case.\n- I'm not sure what's \"scary\" about that comment. If the envars are undefined you should get a familiar authentication exception from boto.\n- S3 buckets are containers of keys not containers of data. You wouldn't \"read\" a bucket in the usual sense.\n  not sure what you meant.\n- This works just fine and has since merging. Perhaps the point you're making is that a usage\n  example in the docs would have been in order. I agree.\n\n``` python\ndf=pd.read_csv('s3://bucketname/my/faux/path/to/data.csv')\n```\n"
