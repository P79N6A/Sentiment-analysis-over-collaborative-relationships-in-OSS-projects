    "body": "@h-vetinari Thanks a lot for working on this!\r\n\r\nTo repeat my comment of the other PR, I personally don't think this should be necessarily included in pandas core, but would be perfect as an external package (now we have the EA interface). \r\nThat said, actually doing this (here or as external package) is indeed very good to iron out the interface, as arrays that contain sequences as scalars will certainly have some additional needs/complexities.\r\n\r\nWe have a dummy JSONArray implementation in the test suite that might run into similar problems, but for now that was not given much attention.\r\n\r\n> several methods, including fillna and astype do not dispatch to the EA impl\r\n\r\nThe `astype` is a know issue (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/22343, as you are aware of), `fillna` should normally dispatch. Do you have a reproducible example to show it does not? If there are any others that don't dispatch, you can open separate issues/PRs for that.\r\n\r\n> Bool ops in particular will have to figure out a contract which side is cast to what, e.g. if op(EA, np.ndarray) is the same as op(np.ndarray, EA), or if the latter downcasts EA.\r\n\r\nCan you give a more concrete example to show what you mean?\r\n\r\n> there's not a lot of documentation what the EA test suite expects. E.g. data must be length 100, data_missing must be [np.nan, instance of dtype] (but data can have missing values too?), data[-1] must non-na, etc.\r\n\r\nThe things you mention above (except the last one) are mentioned in the docstrings in pandas/tests/extensions/conftest.py ? But please feel free to add any better documentation on things that are unclear! \r\nI think we assume that `data` has no missing values (and maybe also that all are unique, not sure). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
