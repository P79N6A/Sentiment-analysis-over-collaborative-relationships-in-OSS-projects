Now if we are going back to suggesting `auth` only, unfortunately, I fail to understand why that is better, I have the exact same questions as I have raised previously. \r\n\r\nWhile I would like to help the project, I lack bandwidth on my end that this async conversation requires. And perhaps it might be best that I just hand what is here to you fine folks to take this forward. I have provided you multiple working solutions which you can choose to pick and modify (or just discard them):\r\n1. `auth` and `verify_ssl` using only urllib\\urllib3 + passing live test cases (previous fork)\r\n2. `auth` and `verify_ssl` using using requests when installed + passing live test cases (previous fork)\r\n3. `url_params` using requests, if installed, while keep using urllib in existing scenarios if `url_params` is not provided + passing live test cases (this fork)\r\nIn my benevolent and sincere view, the current check-in in this pull request is a really good/working/passing solution that I personally do not see any issues with - and as a consumer, it would work for me.\r\n\r\nIf after reviewing all comments in previous pull request, and this pull request, if there are any minor modifications I can make that seem reasonable, I would be happy to do. Please let me know.. else, my apologies that I am unable to contribute to the level of depth that you folks need at the current time.. and request you folks to do what is best. "

    "body": "> I just don't want more keywords in all of the read_* calls. (and I don't particulaly likeurl_params as a kw). auth is fine. verify_ssl if you really really need it\r\n\r\nAlmost no-one does basic auth over http (without ssl). Getting officially verified ssl certs is difficult especially in private environments and testing scenarios. So in those scenarios, the compromise is to use self-signed ssl certs or expired certs or certs whose domains dont match in those cases, and it becomes essential to bypass ssl cert verification to be able to test in that scenario. That is why requests library has a parameter `verify` (with a warning logged every time such request is called). \r\n\r\nNone of us want to add additional params to `read_csv` so the suggestion that use `url_params` for anything `url` related.. be it auth or ssl verification (today) or potential future user asks of changing headers, or timeouts, or proxies, or any other stuff that is http(s) related. That way `read_csv` params never expand beyond `url_params` for http(s) related params.  If a new issue is filed in pandas to allow override of `http timeout`, or allow `proxy server` would we add new parameter to read_csv( timeout=5000, http_proxy=['my.proxy.com'])? Or does it make sense to just add them to 'url_params' along with auth, ssl, etc (or pass in a requests.Session())? \r\n\r\nI often read data that requires http timeout to be non-default. I would like to use the callback functionality that requests library provides to see at times \"_what the heck is going on in the http layer and capture it_\". If I wont be able to set this within pandas, then for me, its just easy to leave anything http (auth/ssl/timeout/callback/proxy etc) related out of pandas as a standard practice, first use requests separately and then use StringIO with read_csv. The currently checked code with `url_params` would allow me to \"opt-in\" to handle every scenario mentioned above that requests supports, while leaving current http flow unaffected.\r\n\r\nIf there is no plan for supporting above mentioned http scenarios, why even take a requests soft dependency? There is already a checked in solution with basic auth, that was already rejected (in previous fork) that worked with urllib/urllib3."

We shouldn't call them `auth_params` because they do and will contain non-auth related parameters such as `verify`. SSL certificate verification is unrelated to authentication.\r\n\r\nThe dict is already well defined (and very short): It can contain `auth` or `verify` and these parameters are passthru to similarly named parameters in `requests`\r\n\r\nThere is one exception in this PR that doesnt meet your requirement: `url_params` can be one of three:\r\n* `None` -- per your requirement\r\n* `dict` containing `auth` or `verify`  -- per your requirement. If anything else is passed, its just ignored but used as signal to force use of `requests` library.. which is actually desirable as it enables uses of `requests` in existing http scenarios.\r\n* a `requests.Session()` object. If it is passed passed, we basically use this session instead of creating our own new `requests.Session()` object. I implemented it this way because this does not interfere with other requirements, but allows a knowledgeable user to really configure requests session object  without requiring pandas feature requests: `Custom Auth`, `proxies`, `timeout`, `callback urls`, etc. \r\n\r\nSo, after this PR merge, if I want to implement `timeout` in my `read_csv`, even though it is not a feature implemented by pandas, I can still do the following:\r\n```python\r\nfrom requests import Session\r\ns = Session()\r\ns.timeout = (1.0, 3.5)\r\ndf = pd.read_csv( url, url_params=s) # great... now my read_csv will timeout as specified.\r\n```\r\nSo far, I cannot see of any disadvantage of allowing passing of `requests.Session()`. I see the advantage of no longer having to play catch-up with changes from requests library, and moving the focus of pandas team from `io` related issues to `core pandas` related issues - which everyone really values pandas for."
