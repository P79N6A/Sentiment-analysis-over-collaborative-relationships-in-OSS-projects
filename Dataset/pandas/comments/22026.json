That is currently the *only* duplication (10 lines of code), so I don't think this is any blocker for any decision, we can easily create a common utility function for that if needed.\r\n\r\n> When debugging you want to change a single line and not even think / worry about any testing artifices.\r\n\r\nCan you give a concrete example or clarify this? \r\nHow is having base tests in one directory and the inherited tests / overwritten methods in another directory helping with this? That would exactly mean that changing a line in one place can have consequences for tests located somewhere else, which makes it IMO worse. \r\n\r\n"

In such a case I only don't see the added value to move them over there."

If, eg in the TestArithmeticOps of the integer array tests, you need to override almost everything from the base class, there is something wrong (and in fact, it was also not needed as I show in this PR). \r\n\r\nAlso, for the integer array, we are going to add a lot more tests while we develop it further (proper reduction, groupby, overflow handling, ...) that all will have a lot of integer-array specificities. Further mixing tests for this with Base test classes that are not meant for such specificities, will further complicate this IMO. \r\n\r\nAs Tom summarized, the proposed split: in the extension tests we only run the existing interface tests (the base classes) and only do the minimum to get those passing for eg IntegerArray (see this PR), everything else that is specific about integer arrays is tested in `tests/arrays/integer`. \r\n\r\nSo if you really think that this is \"terribly confusing\", then please try to give an alternative proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
