    "body": "As suspected, the logic `roll_window()` handles missing data properly where as my naive method produces nonsense answers when there's missing data.\n\n```\nimport scipy.signal as sig\nn=7\nwin = 5\nminp = 3\ns = np.array(np.random.randn(n)+10)\nwindow = sig.get_window('triang', win).astype(float)\nm1 = pd.algos.roll_window(input=s, weights=window, minp=minp, avg=True, avg_wgt=False)\nm2 = pd.algos.roll_window(input=s, weights=window, minp=minp, avg=True, avg_wgt=True)\nm3 = pd.rolling_window(s, window=win, win_type='triang', min_periods=minp)\nplt.plot(s, 'b', m1, 'g', m2, 'r', m3, 'y')\nticks = plt.xticks(range(n))\n```\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7545449/4280033/f1851ab0-3d27-11e4-8b35-c266a3289bd7.png)\n\nMy fix actually causes the calculated mean to be actually higher than the input data where there's missing data.\n\nSo, the proper fix is to update `rolling_window` to invoke `roll_window` with `avg_wt=True`. The question is, do we want to update the `rolling_window` API to allow turning the normalization off? Someone must have thought that was an important possibility at some point to have written `roll_window` to allow both cases.\n"

    "body": "Well, how is \"turning normalization off\" different from specifying `mean=False` (i.e. want sum rather than mean)?\n\nSeems to me that `algos.roll_window()` has too many degrees of freedom:\n(a) if `avg_wgt == True`: normalize total weight used to 1.0; else\n(b) if `avg == True`: normalize by dividing by number of weights used; else\n(c) use weights as provided without any normalization.\n\nObservations/comments:\n1. I believe the code will crash if `avg == False` and `avg_wgt == True`, as `total_wgt` will be accessed but not allocated. Other than that, If `avg_wgt == True`, then `avg` is ignored. So `avg_wgt == True` better imply/set ``avg == True`. Seems awkward.\n2. Is there a use case for (b) (as distinct from (a))? None comes to mind.\n\nMy thought would be:\n(i) In `algos.roll_window()`, delete `avg` and have `avg_wgt` default to `True`.\n(ii) In `rolling_window()`, call `algos.roll_window()` with `avg_wgt=mean` (as opposed to the current `avg=mean`).\n(iii) That still leaves open the choice of normalization for weights from `sig.get_window(win_type, window)` -- which matters only if `mean=False`. I think normalizing them to sum to 1.0 makes the most sense, though also possible to normalize so that the maximum value is 1.0.\n\nI think this would be backwards compatible (except for the case discussed in (iii), which needs fixing anyway), but should confirm...\n"

    "body": "This is starting to get a little philosophical, but I think the problem is deciding what the user should expect. I think in the case of a rolling mean, it is the correct thing to assume that the user expects the weighted mean to fit within the distribution of the points used to calculate it. The behavior reported in #7618 is certainly non-intuitive. If I pass in a series of [10, 10, 10] I would expect the weighted mean to be 10 and not ~6. The way the function is currently written in this PR seems to me the only proper way for a rolling mean to behave.\n\nHowever, when it comes to a rolling sum, the expected behavior is a little more ambiguous. Imagine I pass in the weights [2, 2, 2] and a series of [1, 1, 1].  Would the user expect that the result would be [nan, nan, 6] or [nan, nan, 3]? The function as written in the PR would return [nan, nan, 6]. I don't have a great argument for either way being the proper result.  I don't think that the same weight normalization used in the rolling mean calculation is appropriate. If anything the weights for a rolling sum should be scaled as `window = window / window.max()`.\n\nBy the way, is there much practical use for rolling weighted sums? A google search for \"weighted rolling sum\", \"rolling weighted sum\", \"moving weighted sum\" and \"weighted moving sum\" returns on the order of a few dozen hits total. Maybe the rolling sum aspect of this function should be dumped altogether or moved to a different function to avoid ambiguity.\n"
