To resolve this error, the user needs to add `quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONE` (as this is not the default). \nIs this correct?\n\nIn this case, for me this is a trade-off between having to provide an extra (unneeded) keyword in the simple case (no quotes in file) vs having a wrong error message in case of quotes + sep present in quotes (current behaviour that you are trying to fix).\n"

    "body": "Hmm, we should try to make a decision here. Trying to summarize the options:\r\n\r\n* Current situation: you get an error when having sep inside quoted field. From the error message this is not directly clear\r\n  * Could we possibly do a check when such an error message occurs if there are quotes, and then add to the message: \"possibly this is due to quotes that are ignored when having a multi-char sep\"? (which is what @jreback proposed?) Or just adding it to the message without checking.\r\n* PR: force people to use `quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONE` with the idea of making them aware of the possible problem with quotes.\r\n  * The reason I am not really a fan: a) this also forces the user to use this when there is no potential problem (eg no quotes, or no sep chars inside the quotes), ànd b) this will still give you the same error message when you have sep chars inside quotes but *do* pass `csv.QUOTE_NONE` as the error message says to do\r\n* Checking if there are quotes in the line, and only raising the error in that case\r\n  * Disadvantages: possibly expensive performance wise + still forces users to use `quoting` when they have quotes without sep chars inside + makes implementation more complex for something that is probably not worth it.\r\n* ...\r\n\r\n@gfyoung @jreback Thoughts? \r\nPersonally I would go for the first: leaving the current situation but improving the error message."
