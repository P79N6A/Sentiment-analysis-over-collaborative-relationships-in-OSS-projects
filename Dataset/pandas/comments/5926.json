And in retrospect, that is maybe also logical: the problem in windows is in the building of the rst with unicode to html, and it is the output generated by the code example which causes this. With your changes, the output of the code example still contains special characters (which is also the point of the code example), and so causes the build on windows to stop.\n\nI think @JanSchulz had another approach as a kind of hack: something along the lines of https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/5142#issuecomment-26281482. I also vaguely remember that the issue was fixed when using ipython's version of the ipython directive, but I should check that.\n"
