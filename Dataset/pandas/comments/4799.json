[`mechanize`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mechanize/) can be used to obtain some degree of automation of form submission. not sure what it's dev status is (e.g., whether it's seeing regular changes)\n\nfor the second link:\n\n``` python\nimport pandas as pd\nlist_of_frames = pd.read_html(the_second_url, attrs={'class': 'funds-table'})\n```\n\nread the docs of `read_html` and play around with it. a general rule of thumb for `read_html` is that more complex web pages will require more tinkering\n"
