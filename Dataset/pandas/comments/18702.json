    "body": "I'd prefer that dateutil handle this internally too; my hope is that consensus will develop over there once more people report that it doesn't Just Work.  But until then, it's still a nontrivial question of exactly what we want to recognize by default and whether/how to let users customize it.\r\n\r\nI see two viable options:\r\n\r\n1) The most convenient thing to do -- at least in my comfortably Anglo-centric seat -- would be to pass defaults for a) abbreviations that are unambiguous and b) abbreviations for the most common timezones, e.g. assume CDT means \"Central Daylight Time\" and not \"Cuba Daylight Time\".  Users who want to override that would need to do the parsing step before passing to the Timestamp/to_datetime constructor.\r\n\r\n2) Same as 1, but allow users a mechanism to override the `tzinfos` dict that pandas passes to dateutil."
