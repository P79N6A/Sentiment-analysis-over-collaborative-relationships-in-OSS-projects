When cookbook.rst was first created, I'm guessing the line endings were not handled by git.\n\nI removed all `^M` 's just to make it cleaner for editing because I wasn't sure if mixing the line endings might have unwanted side effects.\n\nLet me know what you think...but I'm happy to change it back.  \n\n*http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5843495/what-does-m-character-mean-in-vim\n"
