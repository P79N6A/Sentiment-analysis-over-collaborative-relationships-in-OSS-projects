I'll make sure to sound the alarm at next release time so that users review their usage of read_csv / read_table. Could use more unit testing on this-- also need to update the sphinx docs to reflect the new defaults and to document usage with MultiIndex (e.g. `index_col=[0, 1]`)-- if you get some energy feel free to do so. I'll create a separate ticket about updating the docs\n"
