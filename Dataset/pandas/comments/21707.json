    "body": "@skebanga As a workaround, use:\r\n```\r\ndf.unstack().resample('T').pad().stack(dropna=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn my PC your Panel example took 669 ms, the above df call took 4.2 seconds. Not quite as fast as Panel but hopefully usable for your purposes as opposed to running into MemoryError. \r\n\r\nNote that Panel was deprecated because the N>2-dimensional case was considered scope for the [xarray ](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) project. You may wish to consider xarray for your use case if you want 3-D numeric data similar to the deprecated numeric Panel. The equivalent call there would be\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport xarray as xr\r\nxarr = xr.DataArray(numpy.random.rand(2558,7,7),\r\n                               coords={'index':index, 'cols':cols},\r\n                               dims=['index', 'cols', 'cols'])\r\nxarr.resample(index='T').pad()\r\n```\r\nOn my box that takes 873 ms, similar to Panel. See [this doc](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/pandas.html#panel-transition) for more details."
