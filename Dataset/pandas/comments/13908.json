    "body": "@jreback Are you sure this is a dupe?  That issue you referenced does not require the use of nanosecond precision, but seems to be about the times when DST changeovers occur.  This bug here does not require DST changeover, but does require nanosecond precision.  It seems plausible that the same area of code is responsible for both bugs, but I don't see how the two bugs are the same, or would necessarily be fixed by the same patch.  Do you?\n"
