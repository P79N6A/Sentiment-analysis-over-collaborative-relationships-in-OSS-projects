Attempted to use the `by` keyword in hist -- surprised to find it wasn't there.\n2. Attempted to call the `hist()` method on a `DataFrameGroupBy` object, just because it seemed natural.\n3. Pivoted to make one column for each intended histogram, and called `hist()` on the resulting `DataFrame`. Success!\n\nBasically, +1 to the ideas of making the signatures to the various plotting methods more uniform and adding the arguments you suggested, and also +1 to lodagro's idea of adding plot methods to groupby objects. And, a grammar of graphics implementation would be amazing!\n"
