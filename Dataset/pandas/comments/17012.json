    "body": "@Khris777 : Hmmm...this is very strange.  It's also difficult to check given the nature of Python's interpreter to silence warnings, especially after they have been raised.  I also can't tell why it might be warning with references to commented lines OR no references at all.\r\n\r\nGiven the difficulty of reproduction, I wonder whether we might be able to tackle this, but let's give it a shot.  Can you post to this issue, two Python files (or two code-blocks, whichever is easier to read):\r\n\r\n1) The original, uncommented code\r\n2) The commented code\r\n\r\nIn addition, if you could provide step-by-step instructions for reproducing the warnings (all of them), that would be great!"

It doesn't seem to be reproduceable like that.\r\n\r\nBut one other thing I forgot yesterday:\r\nIn the second case where it cited that unrelated commented line it always did cite that specific line, even when I added other commented lines before that one. Maybe that's another hint.\r\n\r\nI also forgot to say that I'm using IPython 6.1.0. Running this code in the standard Python console by hand throws only two warnings and no reports on where the errors occur (IPython feature?), and only on the first run, not on successive runs. \r\n\r\nAnd only if I run it manually, if I execute this code as a file in the standard console, the console becomes unresponsive and stops working."
