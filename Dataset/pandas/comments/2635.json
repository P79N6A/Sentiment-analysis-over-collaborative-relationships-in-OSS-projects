    "body": "Agreed, i will file something with them.  However, I find it appealing to rely on numpy to provide the min and max values for the different dtypes rather than having to rely on stdint.h.   I think i should be able to eliminate the use of any of the stdint stuff from parser.pyx.  Would that be helpful or would you rather scrap the change altogether?\n"
