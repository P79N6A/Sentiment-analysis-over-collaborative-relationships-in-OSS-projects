So It might not have been a real bug in the first place. Or it was resolved in some other way and the fix made it resolved twice. :) @jorisvandenbossche @jreback \n"

    "body": "@Oxtay so the value of the Timestamp was fixed by the prior issue, but when constructed in this particular way the tz was not (and hence the hour was off). I think it was just a slightl difference in how datetimes and Timestamp are constructed from the underlying c-structure (for this type of time zone). Fixed up now. thanks for the report.\n"
