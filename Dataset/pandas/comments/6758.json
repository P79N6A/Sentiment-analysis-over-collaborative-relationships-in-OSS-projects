    "body": "Thanks for the correction, tuples (and numpy arrays) do work in the above example. This basically solves the problem for me; i'll just use tuples (at the moment efficiency is not a issue).\n\nWhat i actually tried to accomplish is to store a 2D numpy-array as an element of a DataFrame. Apparently, i can put them in but not retrieve them with .loc (.iloc works but is very cumbersome in my case). As a (nasty) workaround i tried to store a list of 1D arrays and was surprised that it works only up to a length of two (why is that so?).\n\nFrom my limited understanding of multi-level indices, i think they aren't a good match for my case. What i basically need is to be able to store two-dimensional elements (in one column only).\n"
