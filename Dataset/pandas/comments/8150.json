Certainly because it is only in one of the two axes. It is also not how default matplotlib looks, and if we deviate from that we should have a good reason I think (eg like the pandas datetime formatter, which is a big improvement compared to pure matplotlib). And in practice, it is also a behavioural change compared to previous versions.\n"
