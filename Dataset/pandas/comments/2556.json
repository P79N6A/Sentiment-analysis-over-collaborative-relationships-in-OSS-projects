    "body": "It's using quicksort in the second case which has no guarantee of stability. In the first case, it's using a stable multi-key sort algorithm which is slower than simply using quicksort in the single-key case. I could add an option to guarantee stability but I don't think it's worth the performance cost to do that by default necessarily \n"

Given that you can switch the sorting algorithm by converting the column string to a single-element list, I don't think we need an option.  Maybe just a note in the documentation highlighting the two underlying sorting methods.\n"
