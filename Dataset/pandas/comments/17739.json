    "body": "If you read my previous post, I think you can see that I am not completely missing the point. I *agree* that it is duplicate API. But there is still a trade-off between duplicate api vs speed / breaking people's code. \r\nBut I do not agree they are not tested. They are tested by the many indexing tests that use them under the hood.\r\n\r\nBut to the point: by further looking at it, I am certainly fine with the idea of deprecating those functions. As I would also like to clean up the API, and iat/at are I think nicer. \r\nBut, `at`/`iat` are actually also only very small wrappers around `get_value`/`set_value`. They also do almost as little data validation as get_value/set_value (eg the bug report about PeriodIndex with get_value (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/15268), you have exactly the same using `at`). And I think in general this limited validation is actually the feature of those functions/methods (although the fact it cannot handle a Period on a PeriodIndex could be seen as a bug for `at`). \r\nAnd the little bit extra validation they do (the reason they are slower) is IMO not that useful. So I would like to hear if you would be OK with making at/iat a bit faster (closer to get_value/set_value).\r\n\r\nEg, if you look at the `at` implementation for getting, it does the following validation:\r\n\r\n- check that it is a tuple -> otherwise raise ValueError\r\n- on integer axis, check that key is integer -> otherwise ValueError\r\n- on non-integer axis, check that key is not integer -> otherwise raise ValueError\r\n\r\nBut in all those case, when not doing this check, you would get a KeyError otherwise with the `get_value` that is used under the hood. But those checks make up for a big part of the reason that `at` is 3x as slow as `get_value`. \r\nAre those checks necessary? They provide a little bit a more informative error message (compared to just KeyError). And dropping the checks would be an API change from ValueError to KeyError. But IMO they are not really important, and I would be in favor to drop them, making `at` closer in speed to `get_value`.\r\n\r\nWould you be with such a change?\r\n\r\n(and to repeat from above, I am OK with the idea of removing `get_value`/`set_value`)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
