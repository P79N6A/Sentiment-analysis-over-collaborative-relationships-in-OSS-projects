    "body": "It does what I asked - Thanks!\n\nThere is one improvement I think we could make. Assuming I have set the `precision` option to 5, when displaying a chopped entry near other data in scientific format (something like `2.54443e-03`), the chopped value will display as`0.00000e+00`. It would be nice if it just printed `0` instead of `'0.' + '0' * precision + 'e+00'`.\n\nA side note, is there a way to control if things are printed in scientific format (with the e's)?\n"
