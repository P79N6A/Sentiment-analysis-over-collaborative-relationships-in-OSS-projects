I've spent some time digging around to see why this isn't working, but I can't quite figure out why. It looks like this exception is raised [here](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/io/pytables.py#L4653), which means the 'where' variable (an int64index) is passed to self.generate. I don't know enough about the code to know if that's expected or not.\r\n```\r\nself = [0, 1]\r\n\r\n    def evaluate(self):\r\n        \"\"\" create and return the numexpr condition and filter \"\"\"\r\n    \r\n        try:\r\n            self.condition = self.terms.prune(ConditionBinOp)\r\n        except AttributeError:\r\n            raise ValueError(\"cannot process expression [{0}], [{1}] is not a \"\r\n>                            \"valid condition\".format(self.expr, self))\r\nE           ValueError: cannot process expression [[0 1]], [[0, 1]] is not a valid condition\r\n\r\n```"
