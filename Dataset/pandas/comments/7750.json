LTS still has an old numpy. fantastic, but so WHAT? the system installs are pretty much useless for scientific python, if you would actually read my comments in that issue. And it has been brought up since 0.11 IIRC. This has been delayed quite a long time. Talk about back compat!\n\nThat is what I am talking about in terms of time spent. If we didn't have to maintiain this 1.6 compat then I suspect a fair number of new features could be introduced.\n\nYes pickle compat breaks occasionally. We went to VERY great lengths to preserve this. but again if would actually read #7748, that actually its a very recent bug fix in 0.14.1 to provide COMPAT across frequencies. Did happen to have a test for this, so it broke. it will get fixed. So instead of 6000 odd tests, we will have 6001. \n\nHow many projects have this level of care about back-compat????\n"

    "body": "@armaganthis3 @jreback \n\n@armaganthis3 You raise good points, and it always interesting to get the experience from another viewpoint. Pandas has maybe the 'bad luck' of already being very popular but still rather young and rapidly changing, and a good balance between both is not always easy. \nBut @jreback also has a point that we already care a lot about this. Hard work that is maybe not always directly visible. But can it better? Probably, yes. We are also human, and things can always be improved. Getting constructive feedback from users like you is essential for that.\n\nBackwards compatibility is an important issue. As the heating of this discussion also shows! It shows that it is something both of you care about. But a heated discussion is most of the time not very constructive. So maybe we should let this cool down for a moment. Please do that, both of you. \nAnd maybe we can continue it later, in a constructive way, to look at concrete points that could be improved. As that is what we all want, to improve pandas!\n"

    "body": "Here we are 2 days later, and hopefully calm. Excessive punctuation neatly tucked away I hope.\nLet's pick this up, It's important.\n\n@jreback made a lot of comments,  I'll try to cover most of his points, skipping over the\nnasty provoking bits and try to focus back on the issue I actually care about.\n\nPersonally, I don't  need numpy 1.6 support. Others might or might not. The essential issues\nI'm raising is not numpy support but the stability of pandas APIs, that is, keeping pandas code working across versions. I found it ironic that that the example jreback chose to give is what's\nbeing eliminated in the next version, but that's a digression. \n\nKeeping pandas code working across pandas versions is what back-compatible means,\nit's what I care about, It's what I'm worried about.\n\njreback says that bugs and regressions are inevitable and in that a least he is absolutely right.\nThey are also by definition unintentional so It's an entirely different thing when \nmaintainers break an API, knowingly and deliberately. It's not an \"unavoidable mistake\"\nit's a concious choice.\n\nYou may claim this breakages are \"well-thought out\", from what I've seen\nthe reason is not an unavoidable breakage due to evolving code, but misguided \naesthetics (toted as \"consistency\" or \"cleanliness\" or \"nice\") being masquaraded\nas an \"overpowering\" reason to break established API and the code that uses them.\n\n\"So yur saying frequet release is badd ?????\" jreback asks. Not at all.\nYou could have daily releases - no one is forcing you to break APIs while doing it.\nThe problem is not the release scheduele: it's the **combination** of having frequent \nmajor releases, having no maintenance branch and having a liberal attitude about \nbreaking APIs. It's The **combination** of all these. \n\n\"WELL, are YOU going to do the VERY time consuming work involved in keeping a \nmaintenance branch????\"  jreback might say (duly ignoring the combination point I made). \nYou're right, I'm not. Though pandas never had a maintenance afaik and how time-consuming \nit is not known, but let's suppose it is...\n\nWell, how about simply not break APIs so liberally? Use stricter criteria for allowing \nbreakage, make legacy code support higher priority then it is. Do not break existing\ncode deliberately. That would solve the problem without requiring more resources _or_ \nchanges to the release schedule. \n\nWould it help if users said [please-oh-please](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/7217#issuecomment-45092601) don't break APIs?\n\nFinally, about the point that pandas is young, I'll note that pandas is 3 years old, has (10s of) thousands of users in commercial and science application, Is used in production. Is on it's \n2nd or 3rd generation of developers. There are lots of SO questions and existing tutorials. \nLots of existing code. It has great documentation.  In fact It's mature by all criteria I can \nthink off. all except API stability that is.\n"

    "body": "@armaganthis3 The pickle breakage seems like a regression to me. While I lean towards the position of moving fast and upgrading only if you've you read the release notes _thoroughly_, breaking IO across a single (major) version number is moving too fast. Pickles suck, but people use them and we support them so we should try really hard not to break IO related code IMHO.\n\nIn the case of sort vs. order I disagree. The release notes are there, and you don't have to upgrade if you don't want to. IMO it _is_ more consistent if you have them either both stable or both unstable, but not different.\n\n@armaganthis3 Would like you to make a list of the API changes you find especially egregious? That would help us evaluate whether there are unintended regressions or intentional API breakage.\n\nI agree that this in an important issue, but I don't think it's as simple as \"preserve back-compatibility at all costs\".\n"

It's his deliberate disregard and recklessness that angers me, the fobbing-off of the users who complain with nonsense excuses, and the dishonest way in which avoids taking responsibility \nfor his behavior. \n\nMore example are plentiful, seemingly in every comment he makes. jreback just wrote:\n\n> and you point at #7329, which was warned right here: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.14.0/whatsnew.html\n\nHere are all the items in the release notes that mentioned the term \"pickle\":\n- \"Improved performance of compatible pickles (GH6899)\"\n- \"Pickle compatibility is preserved for pickles created prior to 0.13. These must be unpickled with pd.read_pickle, see Pickling.\"\n- \"Fixed running of tox under python3 where the pickle import was getting rewritten in an incompatible way (GH4062, GH4063)\"\n- \"fixed issue with missing attributes after loading a pickled dataframe (GH2431)\"\n\nWhich of these is a warning that some 0.13.0 pickles can't be read in 0.14.0 anymore? Can you see it? I can't. \n\nLet's drive the point home ever further by reading that again:\n\n> and you point at #7329, which was warned right here: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.14.0/whatsnew.html, and turns out is a regression, \n\n@jreback is saying that this is both a documented change warned against and\nat the same time an accidental regression. If you're unhappy with _my_ criticism, aristotle\nhimself would tell you that this is impossible.\n\nThis issue was meant to be about my concerns about the trend in pandas treatment of back-compat, but @jreback's shameful attempts to muddy the waters is even more reprehensible. \n"

    "body": "@armaganthis3 \n\n>  @jreback is trying isn't taking reposnibility for his actions, that's cowardly. and dishonest\n\nThis is just not true. @jreback is the first to own up to any bugs and is constantly fixing them (use pandas to create a bar plot of commit counts by author, you'll see he outpaces the next active contributor by a factor of about 3.5). Also, look up \"duplicate indexing\", \"datetime support\", and \"series refactor\", and then tell me @jreback doesn't take responsibility for his actions.\n\nI don't think these kinds of libelous remarks are helpful in any way. I think criticism is great, but doing so in a way that leads to improvements is generally a more effective way to approach it.\n\n> it wasn't @jreback who fixed it, but @immerr, after my loud complaints.\n\nIn light of the amount of work @jreback does for pandas **for free** and his helpfulness to people who actively criticize his work (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/6011, the negative remarks are gone now but his apology is still there), it doesn't matter who addressed the issue. Pointing fingers is best left to `git blame`.\n\nLet me be clear: backwards compatibility is an important issue. But so is being able to fix things that are broken, even if that means breaking back-compat _occasionally_. How often _occasionally_ is is determined (in no particular order), by the core devs, the feature being broken, the severity of the bug or inconsistency. That said, breaking pickles is unacceptable. However, if something isn't tested, there's no guarantee that it will work (I hope you'll agree with this). If _you_ want to submit a test for things like this in the future so that we have a contract that it works in the future, please do so and we'll gladly review and probably accept your patch. We like tests.\n\n@jreback is being a bit shy about the number of tests: we're above 7000 right now. And lest you accuse me of \"playing the numbers game\", I'll add a disclaimer to take the number of tests comment with a grain of salt.\n\n> That itself suggests that your care for back-compat is slipping, I wish it weren't so.\n\nOn the contrary, `pandas` is where I learned all about it. I don't have as strong a feeling about pickles being back compat, but if it's causing _this_ much pain for someone I think we should try to mitigate that pain.\n\nNo one likes name-calling, and accusing @jreback of doing cowardly things is likely to elicit no response or active avoidance of your bug reports in the future. That's probably how I would handle it. But, knowing @jreback, he'll probably **fix them anyway** because that's the kind of guy that he is.\n\nAlright, I'm not commenting any further on this issue.\n\n@armaganthis3 If you actually have something to contribute other than commentary, like offering to help maintain a \"stable\" branch, that would be most helpful.\n"

    "body": "@armaganthis3 \n\nThe way to ensure you don't get bit by an API change:\n1. test your code (run test suite **before** upgrading production).\n2. test RC and .0 releases with your code base TELL US if there are issues, that way they can be addressed **before** the .1 release. IMO this is an appropriate time to \"raise hell\" (politely).\n3. push tests \"upstream\" into pandas codebase\n\nThe numpy issue [(see the fervour on the mailing list to the proposal to drop 1.6 support)](http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.python.pydata/3075) along with the other \"evidence\" you post is indeed damning... it backs up @jreback entirely:\n\n> I personally care about back compat quite a lot. Have you seen the tremendous lengths pandas has gone to maintain backwards compat with numpy 1.6 and pickle compat < 0.12!!!!!\n\nIf you're not impressed with @jreback's patience/care/heroism/et al... you're misreading the situation.\n\nAnyway. It's worth mentioning you're not the first to bring up the idea of a \"stable\" branch, and it does sounds appealing in principle. However no-one (thus far) has come forward as willing to maintain. Here's some thoughts (perhaps these belong as a sep issue):\n1. Which version is \"stable\" (do you bug-fix _all_ versions?? Since when? When do you release?)\n2. Which bug-fixes do you pull? No doubt some may be mangled with features. Merge conflicts and potentially weirder bugs will appear - IMO would need very deep understanding of all versions to fix.\n3. Even though difficult, this would actually be a _very_ boring thing to maintain.\n4. Most users just upgrade on pip/conda, don't use \"advanced\" versioning, or indeed environments.\n5. Anyone who's anyone will be using latest stable.\n6. User fragmentation, weirder bugs and version nuances (often on SO, solution is basically \"upgrade\").\n\nSaying that, perhaps this situation can be reassessed when/if pandas reaches \"1.0\". Of course, as @cpcloud points out: it's MIT so you're free to create a stable branch :cake:\n"

    "body": "I appreciate you guys stepping up to defend jreback, and I agree it's time to wrap this up,\nbeing about as tired of it as you. But most if not all of your arguments don't hold up when I \nread them, so here's a last volley afaic.\n\n@cpcloud\nThe amount of work jreback puts in is very impressive, but not to the point since I didn't\nclaim otherwise. I did criticize the mishandling of back-compat (as I see it) and his dismissal \nof users who report these issues (evident in the pickle case). `git blame` has nothing to do\nwith jreback's dismissing serious issues as irrelevant, you know this. His attempts at \nmisdirection in this discussion made this thread much worse then it needed to be. it's\nunpleasant for everyone including myself.\n\nfree development has nothing to do with it: either my criticism is correct or it's not.\nConsistently bad decisions aren't made right because jreback isn't payed to make them.\n\n@cpcloud, I agree with your description of how decisions are made (though I don't see\nwhy you included it) on breaking back-compat. as I've repeatedly said: back-compat\nis being broken much too lightly, for frivolous reasons. \n\nYou seem very proud of the number of tests pandas has. None of them help when \nback-compat is broken deliberately with little cause, or when users reporting regressions \nare blown off without reason. If you had 100,000 tests, such behavior would still be a problem.\n\n> >    That itself suggests that your care for back-compat is slipping, I wish it weren't so.\n> \n> On the contrary, pandas is where I learned all about it. \n\nI meant the \"pandas dev team\", though I'm glad pandas has been education for you.\nThe point your contradicting doesn't seem debatable to me: if pickle back-compat has\nbeen zealously maintained over 6 major versions and over two years, and now the team thinks\nbreaking it is no big deal, your standards are slipping. It's just true.\n\nas for you jolly-good-jreback spiel, you're probably right, in any case whether you fix any \nbug reports, mine or others, is something I have no control over. do what you will.\n\n@hayd\n- Having a survery with no responses proves nothing either way . You must have\n  has some stats/research training. Be serious.\n- numpy 1.6 is not an issue I raised, nor did i suggest jreback didn't care about it. what are\n  you contradicting? as I've said, it seemed ironic that jreback chose that of all things an example \n  just when it is being dropped. It's a digression from the issues I raise.\n- Testing and reporting back-compat breakage as you suggest would not (did not) help, \n  if the devs delibarately choose to break stuff, and disclaim regression as jreback has done.\n- I did not, at any point, suggest you need to have a stable branch. I did make the point over \n  and over (and you too ignored this) that in the _absence_ of a stable branch and freuqent \n  releases with back-compat breaks, users are (forgive me) in a pickle.\n- Some of your \"stable branch\" points make sense to me and some make no sense at all. \n  \"Anyone who's anyone\" is quite funny, though, as if release engineering has something to do \n  with a pythonic parallel to beyonce. Like I said, I didn't ask for a stable branch, my suggestion\n  was actually that far less frequent breakage would be the best choice.\n\n> @cpcloud points out: it's MIT so you're free to create a stable branch :cake:\n\nIt's actually 3-clause BSD, but you meant to say it's free software which means you're \nright that I'm free to fork the project, maintain my own branch and in any case I'm \nfree to roll-my-own from scratch.\n\nSadly, that's a default answer to any criticism anyone could ever raise to to you, justified\nor not and it leaves little else to discuss. a sort of panic button really. ok then.\n"
