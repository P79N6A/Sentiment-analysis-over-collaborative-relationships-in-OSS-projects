    "body": "I think this is a good suggestion. Ideally we would like to have labels indicating where we'd like to get community involvement and then have the developer page dynamically update to include these issues.\n\nHowever, this does involve a decent amount of work upfront for us to setup and then also more continued time to provide extra context and explanations in the tagged issues. We are very focused on pandas development right now and are stretched very thin so this isn't something we have time to do in a full-fledged way.\n\nWhat I will do is add a \"community\" label for issues that would be great to have community involvement in and add a blurb on the developer page about those. \n\nIn cases where we haven't provided a lot of guidance, there are some common sense rules you can follow:\n1. the farther a feature is from core pandas data structures and algorithms the more likely it will get quick integration\n2. test cases are essential\n3. documentation is more likely to be integrated quickly than code changes, and documentation on older API features are less likely to change.\n"
