Had to sort the file to have larger numbers or top.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest, at least for numeric columns, not to infer the left boundary for the first column but go with 0.\r\n\r\nI'd rather see a very conservative approach where nothing gets stripped/truncated initially. Rather, we can trim strings later on, if needed.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
