    "body": "you are odding using a version from master which is from oct 2016. have had lots of bug fixes in 0.19.1 and 0.19.2 for ``read_csv``. please give them a try. If you can show a specific example file where this doesn't work, then please update the post.\r\n\r\nfurther you should simply try with less options passed to ``read_csv``, e.g. the ``na_values`` doesn't matter. and ``low_memory`` is a deprecated option."

    "body": "I'll update Pandas and remove `low_memory` as you suggest and see if that improves anything.  Why does `na_values` not matter?  Some of my files do have \"NAN\" for missing values.  So far, every single file where the error is thrown (and several surrounding it) in the loop, read absolutely fine on their own with the exact same `read_csv`...  I can certainly show this. I'm hoping the update solves this."
