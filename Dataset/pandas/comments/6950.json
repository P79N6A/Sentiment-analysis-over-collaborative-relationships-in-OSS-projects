So I think the question is also: is there a reason there are two functions (pivot/pivot_table)? Have they incompatible functionality? Or could we maybe merge them into one? \n\nBecause it would be strange to have a `pd.pivot` but a `DataFrame.pivot` calling `pd.pivot_table`. So I think we should think it a bit more through.\n"

    "body": "Hi (I'm new) but came into a problem with the 0.13.1 pivot_table function. \n\nNot totally sure if this is relevant to this discussion... but I lifted my question from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23366016/pandas-0-13-1-pivot-table-pivot-error-not-in-0-12-0-should-and-how-i-go\n\nSo I have two lines of code below.\n\nOne that works successfully with Python 2.7.5 and Pandas 0.12.0\n\n`dfp = pd.pivot_table(df, values=pivYears, rows=['partid'],cols=['finestflag_OV'], aggfunc=np.sum)`\nAnd this one that does not work successfully with Python 2.7.6 and Pandas 0.13.1. I'm getting error refering to\n\n`malloc: *** mach_vm_map …. error code = 3`\nhere's the code:\n\n`dfp = pd.pivot_table(df, values=pivYears, index=['partid'],columns=['finestflag_OV'], aggfunc=np.sum)`\nIt could be that I am misunderstanding pivot vs. pivot_table and/or how it works in 0.13.1.\n\nLastly, since I've been using 0.12.0 for a while and am comfortable with it, is it possible to downgrade from 0.13.1 to 0.12.0 on my new machine? (Also, can I go back in Python versions so all my machines have the same version of Python and Pandas?)\n\nEdits for questions: Both OS's are OS X 10.9.2.\n\nHere's a subset of 9 rows of data in the CSV. https://github.com/nygeog/python/blob/master/pandas/pivot_sample.csv\n\nThe actual file has ~1.7 million rows. Which works fine on machine with 0.12.0.\n\nThanks, Danny\n"
