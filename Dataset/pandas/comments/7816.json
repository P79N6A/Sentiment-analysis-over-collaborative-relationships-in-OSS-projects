    "body": "The bug, unfortunately, seems to be in stata.  Stata's dta file definition claims that it gives the offset to the start of this segment as 1 of 14 8 byte values, in <map>.  Unfortunately, this value is 0 (0000 0000 0000 0000 in the file) in this file, and is 0 in 1 I just saved from Stata 13.\n\nThe code appears to be a correct implementation of Stata's documented file format, so I'm not sure if this should be \"fixed\" (which would be to hack around Stata's problem).\n"

    "body": "Thanks for looking into this so quickly. I'll see about contacting folks at Stata to see whether they can fix their documentation, which would then just justify modifying Pandas. \n\nTo summarize then: the problem is that the offset (to the start of the segment in the dta file that defines the variable labels) should be 1, according to Stata's documentation (in `help dta`), but this offset is in fact 0 instead. Correct?\n\nMany thanks,\n"
