    "body": "@airanmehr Thanks for your interest in contributing!\n\nHowever, I think this function is too specific to be included in pandas. It seems a rather domain-specific function, is that correct?\n\nBut I would certainly want to encourage you to share it in other ways than including it in pandas itself. This can be by starting to simply put it on github, eg in a notebook with an example. So people can find this and use it. \nA next step would be to make a small package from it that people can install and use. If you would be interested in something like that, I would suggest to look at https://github.com/uwescience/shablona (\"A template for small scientific python projects\")\n"
