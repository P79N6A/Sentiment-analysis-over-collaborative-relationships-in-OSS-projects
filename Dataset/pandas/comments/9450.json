    "body": "@shoyer I think it should at least be an option? Personally I would rather get a dict than a Panel, but that is more because I never worked with Panels before. Plus, there is no requirement that there are common indices in the different sheets, so a Panel is not really desired in that case I think?\n\n@jnmclarty I think this is nice new functionality! To your questions:\n- I wouldn't put the print statement there as default. If we want it, the user should at least be able to silence it (something like `verbose` argument, I don't know it something like that is already used somewhere else in pandas).\n- For the `sheetname` documentation, I think the additions are certainly good. Only the last part (the different options, will have to be formatted a bit so it displays well, I will put some inline comments).\n- For me, I don't think this new functionality warrants a new top-level function like `read_excel_sheets`. As doing `read_excel(.., sheetname=None)` is rather easy. But lets see what others think of this.  \n  In any case, it could maybe be more prominently documented how to do this. Eg something like `By default, it reads the first sheet. Specify the `sheetname` argument to select a specific sheet or use `sheetname=None` to read all sheets.` that could be on top of the docstring (after the first line).\n"

    "body": "@shoyer Thought about it, and my logic was the same as @jorisvandenbossche, plus, I'd wager that there are many times when the sheetnames are not something where an index makes sense.  Eg. \"Sheet3\", \"Sheet4\", \"Sheet5\" have data, but Sheet1 and Sheet2 got used for aggregation/reporting and were renamed properly.  Also, returning a dict forces the user to realize that the resulting dataframes are not ordered.  And...final point...returning a panel, we would have to make an assumption about the order for the sheetname=None case.\n\n@jorisvandenbossche Thanks for the input.  I'll give this another 32 hours or so to let other feedback trickle in, and then begin implementing your comments.\n"

I handled 2 of 3 duplicates that would result from `['1',0,0]`, in my latest commit.  So, passing `['1',0,0]` would return the same object as `['1',0]`.  At this point though, maybe the user wants a duplicate copy of the DataFrame?  Honestly, at this point, we've got an excel file with a ridiculously unfortunate naming convention, and a Pandas user that insists on a single line API call.  I say, at this point, give the user the duplicates they request.\n\nThe duplicates the user would get, are definitely not ambiguous (unless the user doesn't understand object types?)\n"

I'm wondering if different exceptions are raised depending on the modules, or versions of modules, installed.  I reverted back my addition of IndexErrors, in 1783636 , but left it commented out. I believe Travis will not complain, with this final squash.  Assuming it passes, this PR can be merged, but either I, or somebody else should look into the exceptions that are thrown, and the exceptions that should be thrown, for all the various cases, and versions.  To me, this is low-value add, as the user of any given stack, will get a specific exception, and they will handle it according to their stack.~~\n"

It merely extends the same behaviour that would have existed before this PR.  So, `sheetname=3`, will do the same thing as `sheetname=[2,3]`, if there is no 4th sheet.  I removed my confusion inducing commented out exceptions that got added half-way through this PR discussion.  All our discussion surrounding IndexError is mute. \n\nI also implemented ensure_clean() in the one test.\n\nAcknowledge my latest, and I'll squash sometime within 5 minutes to 12h time.\n"
