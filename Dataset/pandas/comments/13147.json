    "body": "The messy tricks aren't too bad because they only have to support a specific list of old, non-moving Python versions, and I already went through and checked that all of those versions are handled correctly. All future versions of Python have a clean upstream supported way to do this.\n\nBut, if you want to avoid that, you actually can -- the really clever stuff in meta module is required to support the case where you need to fix up a module from inside that module (e.g. if you wanted to deprecate to attribute of pandas itself), without rewriting all your API export logic. For pandas.core.common you could have pandas.core import it and then replace it with a metamodule-style subclass without getting ctypes involved.\n"

    "body": "Certainly +1 on the general idea! I think it is important to better formulate which functions can be relied on in other packages. \nSome related issues discussing similar ideas: #5460, #9895\n\nBut some comments ot the PR:\n- Moving all those functions from `core` to `types` seems a bit strange to me. These are a lot of common utility functions, which are not necessarily tied to `types` (I would keep that for the actual custom dtypes and related functionality we have in pandas). Having a `pd.common` or `pd.utils` module holding these seems more logical to me.\n- I am not fully convinced of the `pandas.api` module (certainly the `pd.api.types` seems unnecessary as there is already a `pd.types.api`). But, I personally think we should try to use the same api internally in pandas as how we promote to use it in other packages using pandas.\n- we should test the api somewhere (whether it is just testing that those functions are available in a certain namespace, so we get notified by a failing test when a function gets removed for some reason)\n- we should also document it somewhere which functions are regarded as public (eg a new section in the docs for \"package development depending on pandas\" or something better phrased)\n- I think this should not necessarily need to go in a minor release 0.18.2 (as I said in https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/13003#issuecomment-218792295). I know it is mainly copy pasting and not actually changing implementation, but it is still touching a lot of lines. I am also not saying we should hold this up, but it can just be a matter of naming and we can call master 0.19.0. Anyway, I should find the time to reply to you in https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/13003. This is not directly related to the content of this PR, maybe best to leave that discussion there.\n"

    "body": "@jorisvandenbossche some responses\n\n> Moving all those functions from core to types seems a bit strange to me. These are a lot of common utility functions, which are not necessarily tied to types (I would keep that for the actual custom dtypes and related functionality we have in pandas). Having a pd.common or pd.utils module holding these seems more logical to me.\n\nthe vast majority of this IS type stuff. The problem is we had a circular import issue where things depended on `core.common` which then depended on that (e.g. `core.base`); here I removed that dependency.\n\n> I am not fully convinced of the pandas.api module (certainly the pd.api.types seems unnecessary as there is already a pd.types.api). But, I personally think we should try to use the same api internally in pandas as how we promote to use it in other packages using pandas.\n\nI did this for namespace compat, IOW. then it allows a 'user' to only import think rather than having to import the entire api e.g. `from pandas.api import testing, types` for example, to allow specific imports.\n\n> we should test the api somewhere (whether it is just testing that those functions are available in a certain namespace, so we get notified by a failing test when a function gets removed for some reason)\n\nyes I will add this\n\n> we should also document it somewhere which functions are regarded as public (eg a new section in the docs for \"package development depending on pandas\" or something better phrased)\n\nyes I should add this, though sort of the reason for including now (aside from its a cleanup) is that we don't have to fully publish this till 0.19.0\n\n> @jreback small question, above you said \"I added array_equivalent to the pd. namespace\", is this still the case? (diff is so huge it is difficult to check) If so, is this needed? (internally it is imported from pandas.types.missing)\n\nyeah I thought we exposed this, but going to remove it from the `pd` namespace; its not necessary\n"

    "body": "As I said before, I dislike the introduction of `pandas.api` a bit as entry-point for external packages. I think we should have a good API that can be used both in external packages as in the different core pandas modules (to avoid discrepancies and confusion). Given that currently `pandas.api` is mainly the content of `pandas.types.common`, why not documenting it as available like that? (or putting it in `pandas.types` or `pandas.common` if we want it less deeply structured)\nBut given that I am the only one saying this, I will have to live with it :-)\n\nAnyway, also given that this is indeed a pita to rebase, I am fine with merging this now. We can always adapt a little bit later (and once your PR is merged, it will also be easier to change some things further, indicating the value of this PR!)\n"

    "body": "> should I take it out? I don't have an easy way of deprecating\n\nI agree we can't take it out (since it's already used in the wild). \nOne way of being able to deprecate them would be to redefine them in core/common (which just calls the version in types/common) with a deprecation warning. That seems a lot of work, but I think it could maybe be done rather automatically in a for loop? \n(but also not essential to get this merged)\n"
