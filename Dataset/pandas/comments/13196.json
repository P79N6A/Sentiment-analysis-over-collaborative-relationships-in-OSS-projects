    "body": "Its very confusing that you are naming a `Series` as `index`.\n\nBut in any event, you are mis/ab-using the API. You are expecting a numpy array to index something when it cannot even hold the data type (yes it did hold it prior to 0.17.0, as `object` dtype, but in a very inefficient way). The point is you _should_ not be using this at all.

    "body": "@jeremywhelchel As @jreback pointed out, datetime data with a timezone were previously stored as `object` dtype (which is not efficient), and this was changed in 0.17.\n\nThis was a huge improvement for dealing with timezone data in columns, but as a consequence of the refactor, the `.values` is no longer returning `Timestamp` objects, but a datetime64 array:\n\n```\nIn [19]: index.values\nOut[19]:\narray([Timestamp('2011-01-01 09:00:00-0800', tz='America/Los_Angeles'),\n       Timestamp('2011-02-02 03:00:00-0800', tz='America/Los_Angeles')], dtype=o\nbject)\n\nIn [20]: pd.__version__\nOut[20]: '0.16.2'\n```\n\nvs\n\n```\nIn [24]: index.values\nOut[24]:\narray(['2011-01-01T18:00:00.000000000+0100',\n       '2011-02-02T12:00:00.000000000+0100'], dtype='datetime64[ns]')\n\nIn [25]: pd.__version__\nOut[25]: '0.18.1\n```\n\nAnd this is the reason you cannot longer access the elements using the `.values` (but as @jreback said, you don't need to)\n"

This behavior caused a handful of breakages in our codebase, so we just wanted to make sure it was intended. I agree storing the array rather than a series of individual timestamps is an improvement. Thanks for the fix!\n"
