So the issue still remains, it just no longer segfaults while cleaning up the issue (which is all that #14696 fixed).\r\n\r\nI can provide you the logs when run in debug mode and compiled with -DVERBOSE if you'd like. I can also provide a Dockerfile to create an env which reproduces this reliably."

    "body": "There are two bugs involved. The first is rather trivial: the `error_msg` pointer in `tokenizer.c` begins uninitialized and must be `malloc()`d any time you want to fill in an error message. It looks like someone caught this problem a while ago but requiring individual allocations at the point of use rather than just pre-allocating a fixed size buffer seems brittle. Of course, if someone forgets to pre-allocate, you'll get an illegal free when the tokenizer is being cleaned up, which is exactly what happened.\r\n\r\nTwo simple fixes for this: either just add the missing allocations, or pre-allocate a fixed size buffer that will hold an `error_msg`. The latter of course leaves open the possibility that the error message being set is larger than the buffer, but in practice these are all set via `snprintf` so it shouldn't actually be an issue.\r\n\r\nI'll describe the \"real\" issue in the next comment but would like to know how you'd like me to solve this first problem."

    "body": "The issue that triggers the bug above occurs when reading in a large CSV with `from_csv(..., low_memory=False)`. The underlying buffer used during tokenization is resized based on the size of the stream, but if the stream is large enough this will cause an overflow in the integer keeping track of the capacity, causing it to go negative and trigger its out-of-memory error (the issue above manifests itself because one of the `error_msg`s missing an allocation was \"out of memory\").\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense to change this to a 64-bit integer? I think this will only occur more and more frequently given how cheap RAM is, and ideally, the maximum size of the buffer matches the underlying machine's architecture, where I'm guessing it's far more common to be running x86_64 rather than i386. The other possibliity is to guard against such an overflow and just error out if it _would_ happen, but that limits the amount of RAM one can use to parse very large CSVs\r\n\r\n@wesm @jreback Any input here would be appreciated. I'm happy to fix the issues and write the tests. Just want to know which approach (or another one altogether) you'd like to take."

    "body": "> Re int64_t vs size_t, isn't the platform-specificity a positive property?\r\n\r\nIn my experience it's better to stick with platform independent types exclusively if you can -- see Google's C++ guidelines for some discussion of this https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Integer_Types \r\n\r\n> For integers we know can be \"big\" [Wes: on some platform], use int64_t\r\n\r\nI find it reduces the amount of platform specific code that leaks into your application. If you need to convert from `int64_t` to `int32_t`, then you should static cast, but it may be unclear when you need to insert an explicit cast when you convert from a platform specific type to a platform agnostic type or vice versa."

Of the C integer types, only int should be used. When appropriate, you are welcome to use standard types like size_t and ptrdiff_t.\r\n\r\nI would say this is one case where the use of a standard type whose sole purpose is to accurately reflect the size of a container seems reasonable but will defer to you if you disagree."
