    "body": "Just to elaborate: it seems like you might be confused about the difference between instances and classes. A class is a factory that creates instances. In Python, the way to create a class is the invoke it's constructor (the name of the class) like a function, i.e., `xl_file = ExcelFile('awesome_xl_file.xlsx')`. This creates an _instance_ of the `ExcelFile` object. This instance (also referred to as an object) has methods bound to it meaning (roughly) they are functions that operate in the namespace of the instance of the class.\n\n[Here's](http://www.technovelty.org/python/investigating-the-python-bound-method.html) a nice diagram (if aliased) of what's actually happening when you define an instance method (usually we just refer to these as methods, unless we're also talking about class methods).\n\nInstead of using the class `ExcelFile`, I would suggest using `pd.read_excel`, which constructs the file and calls the (instance) method `parse` for you (and thereby takes the same arguments as `ExcelFile.parse` modulo the path to the Excel file).\n\nHope this clears up some of the mystery behind the error message you reported!\n"
