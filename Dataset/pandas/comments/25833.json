    "body": "I wouldn't expect your output as a and b are the same object. You probably want to assign a copy of `b` so:\r\n\r\n```python\r\na['Hi'] = b.copy()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suppose builtin containers in Python handle this slightly differently by printing a reference to the object:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [440]: a = b = list('abc')\r\n\r\nIn [441]: a.append(b)\r\n\r\nIn [442]: a\r\nOut[442]: ['a', 'b', 'c', [...]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo maybe could do something similar here, though I can't imagine where this is actually useful"
