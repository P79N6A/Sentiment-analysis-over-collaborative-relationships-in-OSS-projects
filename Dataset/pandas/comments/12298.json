    "body": "In my eyes, from the user point of view, the dtype representation should not influence the resulting crosstab. After filtering the original table, some values are gone. So they should not be represented in any crosstab that we perform on a filtered table, regardless of what the categories are.\n\nIn my particular case, I am using categorial dtypes just for the sake of reduced RAM consumption and improved speed. Without categories I would easily end up swapping to disk every now and then.\nSo there are even columns of measurement values represented by categories.\nAfter creating some crosstabs on filtered tables, it took me quite long to actually find out, why there are columns/rows wth all zeros. Looking up the respective column labels in the filtered tables leads to no results, so why are they listed in those crosstabs? This is definitely not what I as a user expected.\n\n@gfyoung: I understand,  that I am sort of abusing the concept of categorical data here, if we consider categories being something like, e.g., selling features, which typically consist of a handful, rarely changing members.\nIn my case, categories can easily consist of several thousand members (e.g. serial numbers or part numbers), where the filtering operation is crucial for concentrating just on a small subset withing these categories. But when the crosstab does not respect the previously applied filtering operation, this is sort of useless.\n\nConclusion: In my eyes, the resulting crosstab should by default not depend on the dtype, as an occasional user will certainly not be aware of the sublte differences.\n"

    "body": "> Conclusion: In my eyes, the resulting crosstab should by default not depend on the dtype, as an occasional user will certainly not be aware of the subtle differences.\n\nIMO \"Categories\" are more similar to \"ints\" than \"strings\": the whole range of possible values has a meaning, not only individual values (at the least when there is some order between these values). In a histogram you wouldn't leave out some ranges just because they are empty and similarly you shouldn't leave out empty categories.\n"
