No joy, still seeing the same problems, and my attempts at getting a Python debug build in windows have so far only ended in frustration....\n\nWith my own mingw the tests pass but I've seen a very occasional segmentation fault with an MSVC compilation. Happened twice during about 20 test runs, I haven't been able to reproduce it since but the one time it happened while running nose in verbose the segmentation fault occurred in `test_align_fill_method`. \n\nI had some relevant valgrind output but my VM's just crashed. Will append it here once I get it back.\n\nEdit: `test_align_fill_method` is in `test_frame.py`\n"
