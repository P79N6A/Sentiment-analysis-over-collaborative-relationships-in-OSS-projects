Thanks for the understanding, This is one of my first non doc PRs.\r\n\r\nno they should be converted to the ``_exception``. you can try just catching ``IndexError/TypeError`` where where the bare exceptions are now.\r\n\r\nIts very important that the exceptions that are related to indexing are consistent (think from a user perspective). and so we don't/can't change them. However we may have an implementation that actually does positional type things (e.g. ``.take``), which may raise an error for something not found, but (in this case) are doing label indexing so a ``KeyError`` is correct, but the same code block may *also* handle positional indexing (the subclasses define _exception), so the ``_exception`` is then ``IndexError`` (again for consistency)."

Some of the builds are failing, but for conflicting reasons. 3.4 is blowing the stack, 3.5 is failing because it because the recursion limit is being set to low.  I've reached an impasse in googling.  Something doesn't smell right in artificially setting the `setrecursionlimit`, but I can't think of another way to ensure the stack doesn't actually overflow before the exception it thrown?  "
