    "body": "Sorry for the delay.\r\n\r\nLet's back up. The question is what is the method supposed to do. Reading the documentation, the method - at least in part - implements the recursive exponent weighted average:\r\n\r\n```\r\ny[t] = alpha * y[t-1] + (1 - alpha) * x[t]\r\n```\r\n\r\nx[t] is the input, y[t] the output. This method, with some variations, results in an expanding window. \r\n\r\nAn alternative is to use a rolling (or moving) fixed length window. For a window width 2, we get `alpha=2/3`, and weights of 1/3, and 1.  The rolling window would give:\r\n\r\n```\r\ny[0] = (1 * x[0]) / 1\r\ny[1] = (1 * x[1] + 1/3 * x[0]) / (1 + 1/3)\r\ny[2] = (1 * x[2] + 1/3 * x[1]) / (1 + 1/3)\r\ny[3] = (1 * x[3] + 1/3 * x[2]) / (1 + 1/3)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.ewm.html) the documentation says:\r\n\r\n>\tWhen adjust is False, weighted averages are calculated recursively as:\r\n>\t`weighted_average[0] = arg[0]; weighted_average[i] = (1-alpha)*weighted_average[i-1] +  alpha*arg[i].`\r\n\r\nwhich is the recursive/expanding window method\r\n\r\nHowever right above this quote, the same doc says:\r\n\r\n>When adjust is True (default), weighted averages are calculated using weights `(1-alpha)**(n-1), (1-alpha)**(n-2), ..., 1-alpha, 1`.\r\n\r\nFurther, going [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/computation.html#exponentially-weighted-windows) and paging down a couple of times and you get the following explanation of span, half-life, and other terms:\r\n>Span corresponds to what is commonly called an “N-day EW moving average”.\r\n\r\nThis at least suggests that calling the function as: `aSeries.ewm (span=2, adjust=True).mean ()` will result in a rolling window as above.\r\nSo for `x = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, ... ]` we get:\r\n\r\n```\r\ny[0] =  1 * 0 / 1\r\ny[1] = (1 * 1 + 1/3 * 0) / (1 + 1/3)\r\ny[2] = (1 * 2 + 1/3 * 1) / (1 + 1/3)\r\ny[3] = (1 * 3 + 1/3 * 2) / (1 + 1/3)\r\n```\r\nwhich is not what is produced\r\n\r\nSo either the method is not making a rolling (or moving) window calculation, or the documentation is problematic. Rereading the document several times, I tend to think the rolling window calculation is not intended, but rather the documentation is overly fuzzy.\r\n"

    "body": "In the interests of expediency, I'm going to jump in at the first point I have a question. \r\n\r\n> The rolling window would give:\r\n> ```\r\n> y[0] = (1 * x[0]) / 1\r\n> y[1] = (1 * x[1] + 1/3 * x[0]) / (1 + 1/3)\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nWhen you say `rolling`, do you mean `ewm`? If so, should that be `1 * y[0]` rather than `1 * x[1]`? If not, how do you derive the formula? There's no `alpha` in a rolling calc, only a `window`?"
