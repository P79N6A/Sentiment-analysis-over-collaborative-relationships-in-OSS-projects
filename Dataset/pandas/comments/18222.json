I see how the plots are confusing and I should have explained their meaning in a way that is more clear.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of my example code, I commented out several lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Produces correct output when uncommented:\r\n# ax[0].legend()\r\n# ax[1].legend()\r\n# ax[2].legend()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen these lines are commented out, the sample code produces a plot with **incorrect legend labels.** If you run the sample code exactly as I provided in the original issue, then it will produce the erroneous incorrect output.\r\n\r\nWhen these lines are uncommented, the sample code produces a plot with the **correct legend labels.** However, the issue is that pandas should be producing this output without requiring these lines to be run.\r\n\r\nIn the expected output section of my issue, the first plot shows the output which is incorrect, and the second plot shows what the correct output should be (intended as a reference).\r\n\r\nDoes this answer your question? I will update my issue to make this more clear."
