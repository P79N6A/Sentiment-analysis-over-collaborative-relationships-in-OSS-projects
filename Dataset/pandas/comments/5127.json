    "body": "@hmeine \n\nthanks for the test case. This is straightforward to fix; but a little bit non-intuitive when first looking at the code. There are many times when an exception is used to decide what happens, in this case a list causes the index engine to raise an InvalidIndexing error and then the series is ultimately reindexed (using the indicies as locations). The ndarray was actually returning the value directly (the theory goes that the list could actually be holding something else so best not to attempt a direct get using the cython code, while the ndarray can only hold indices so it is safe).\n\nfixed up...thanks for the catch!\n"
