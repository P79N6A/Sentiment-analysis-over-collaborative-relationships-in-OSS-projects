EPD-free / MacOS is 32bit; we are seeing the same problem with our 32-bit windows builds.  Will try to get resolved asap.\n\nLast passing commit (though subject to possible int32 overflow in corner cases): 89bdb1eed407048d901f2eaefe31ec3f85f9f692\n\n@wes I'll email you jenkins log output, but I'll start digging.\n"
