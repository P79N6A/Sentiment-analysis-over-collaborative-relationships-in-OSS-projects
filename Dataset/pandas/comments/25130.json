    "body": "This is documented: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.apply.html. It is required so that `apply` can infer what you implicitly want to do (aggregate, transform, etc.).\r\n\r\nNote also that use of a groupby function that mutates the data in the DataFrame is always discouraged. Instead calculate the new value and assign the result back into the original frame."
