    "body": "yeh, numpy I think numpy should be calling `__array_wrap__`. ufuncs call it, but I don't know when/why other numpy funcs should call it.\n\npandas doesn't get a callback so not real easy to work around. In _this_ case you simply don't need to use `np.nan_to_num`, just do `.isnull()` (which is much better anyhow, it handles _any_ dtype).\n\nI would file these as upstream bugs.\n"
