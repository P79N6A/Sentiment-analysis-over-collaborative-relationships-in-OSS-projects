    "body": "cc @danielballan, I went a bit mental creating engine specific methods/functions, I think it will make the logic easier to follow (need to clean a bit more), engine it makes dtype writing much easier. There is more refactoring to do.\n\nAt the moment I just test with engine, but should probably have another test with connection (or even cursor) which hits the stuff you put together (again just be subclassing the test classes). I think abstracting away tests and main code ought to make all this much easier... I see light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nCurrently seem to be having engine.execute issues when passing tuples (which I'm sure were ok earlier)...\n\nLooks like need to rebase after the 2to3 thing :s\n"
