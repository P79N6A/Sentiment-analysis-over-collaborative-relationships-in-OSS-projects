A clearer error message is to the benefit of new users.\r\n\r\nFor context, MATLAB's error messages are full of \"Did you mean:\" suggestions of this sort, and one can only assume that they spent time thinking about user experience. I see no downside to them, and even if they end up outdated, they still let users know that the feature exists at all."
