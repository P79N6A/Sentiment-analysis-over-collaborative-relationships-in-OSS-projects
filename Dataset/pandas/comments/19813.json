    "body": "There's two issues here.\r\n\r\n1. The default empty dtype differ between `Series` and `DataFrame`. We have other issues for that https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/17261. The correct comparison is to `pd.Series([], dtype='object').sum()`.\r\n\r\n2. The result of `pd.Series([], dtype='object').sum()` has changed:\r\n    - 0.20.3: 0\r\n    - 0.21.1: nan\r\n    - 0.22.0: False\r\n\r\nGiven that the behavior now matches `np.array([], dtype='object').sum()` @shoyer do you know if that's the documented correct behavior for NumPy? If so, I'd like to test and document it for pandas as well."
