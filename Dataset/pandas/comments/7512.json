    "body": "Note that rolling_cov/corr call _flex_binary_moment(), which does align the two arguments (using _prep_binary() in the case of two series). The problem is that rolling_cov/corr shrinks the window _before_ the alignment is done. So I think the \"right\" solution is simply to delete/change the window = min(len(arg1), len(arg2)) line in rolling_{cov,corr}, as it seems completely gratuitous (and erroneous) to me.\n\nAfraid I'm not set up two submit a pull request. (\"Not set up\" = \"don't really know how\" -- am a bit new to the whole git / github and even Python thing...)\n\nThere are other issues with _flex_binary_moment, for which I think I have a solution, but will submit a separate issue for that.\n"
