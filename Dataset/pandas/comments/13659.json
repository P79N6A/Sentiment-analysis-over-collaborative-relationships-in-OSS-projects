It completely flummoxed me for all of 5 minutes, then I realised that I passed `rsuffix = '_x'` instead of `'_y'`. This is an issue because had I not checked my output, I could have run into some serious trouble. \n\nPerhaps it should raise an error when suffixes are not passed and there are duplicate columns, as it does. But then perhaps it should warn if the passed suffixes also cause duplicate column names. That way you cater to the deliberate choice of the user as you put it. \n"
