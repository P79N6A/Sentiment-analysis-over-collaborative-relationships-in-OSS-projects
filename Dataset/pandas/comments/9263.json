    "body": "Currently, git master for pandas is based on pyperclip 1.3, the latest version is 1.5.7. The Unicode features for Windows were added very recently. I'd be tempted to replace the code `pandas.util.clipboard` with https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip/blob/master/pyperclip/__init__.py. I don't know how to compile and test pandas on Windows (I've always used Christoph Gohlke's binaries).\n\nMy use case at the office was that I was trying to load clipboard data from Excel that was in Spanish. The current code in `pandas.util.clipboard` couldn't handle this. I am at home now but I think a UnicodeDecodeError was thrown - it should be easy to reproduce this issue with non-ASCII clipboard data.\n"
