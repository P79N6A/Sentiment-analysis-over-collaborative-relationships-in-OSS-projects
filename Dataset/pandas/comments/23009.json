    "body": "@pambot \r\nThere was time pressure for #20347 before `v0.23.0rc` and a few things did not get fully discussed. Had I known that `is_listlike(<set>) = True`, I would have excluded it specifically.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I'm struggling to think of a use-case in pandas where the order is irrelevant - it's a different (and larger) discussion whether that aspect of `is_listlike` should maybe be changed, but it should *definitely* be changed for `.str.cat`"
