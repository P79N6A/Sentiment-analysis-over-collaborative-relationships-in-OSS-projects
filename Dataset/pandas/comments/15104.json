    "body": "The name \"labels\" is nicely unambiguous about referring to `DataFrame.columns` or `DataFrame.index`, unlike the highly overloaded \"name\". So all things being equal, `relabel` would seem more consistent with setting index/column values than `rename`.\r\n\r\nBUT `rename` already basically does this and I'm not sure a deprecation cycle is worth it. I do think multiple methods may be a good thing, but they should be distinguished by which names they change, not now how they change them (dict vs list).\r\n\r\nI am more inclined toward the solution #14829, which enables `list` input to `rename`. I am OK with distinguishing between tuples and lists for dispatching on `Series.name`. If I had my way, `np.array` and `pd.Series` would not coerce tuples (treating them as immutable scalars), only lists.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that we do have an existing `rename_axis` method, too. To summarize the current state of affairs:\r\n- `Series.rename` sets `Series.index` (`dict`/function) or `Series.name`, depending on the type of input .\r\n- `Series.rename_axis` sets `Series.index` (`dict`/function) or `Series.index.name` (others), depending on the type of input.\r\n- `DataFrame.rename` sets `DataFrame.columns`/`DataFrame.index`\r\n- `DataFrame.rename_axis` sets `DataFrame.columns`/`DataFrame.index` (`dict`/function) or `DataFrame.columns.name`/`DataFrame.index.name` (others), depending on the type of input\r\n\r\nCCing @MaximilianR in case he has ideas."
