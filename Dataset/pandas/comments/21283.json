    "body": "Looks like this is an issue not specific to just resample, but also any subsequently chained function that does not take in MultiIndex. I guess the implementation of groupby retains row labels as they are because that would offer the most amount of information and clarity to the user when he is dealing with the groups after groupby. \r\nOne possible question is would it be necessary to implement a pandas.MultiIndex.droplevel function when grouping on MultiIndex. (Is this what you are looking for?) That seems unnecessary as the working answer you mentioned has already proven, to flexibly use the values of a column to achieve the grouping rather than setting them into index to group. "
