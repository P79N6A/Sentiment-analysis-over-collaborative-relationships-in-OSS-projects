    "body": "Before posting the issue i looked at the unittests and these covered the positional slicing on integer index, i found it hard to believe these would be a remainder from removing positional indexing on int index. I did not think of the numpy array functions, so i did not understand the choice. \n\nSo slicing on an object with integer index is an exception to the exception that objects with integer index have no fallback to positional indexing :-).\n\nI checked the docs ([here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#advanced-indexing-with-integer-labels),  [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/gotchas.html#integer-indexing) and [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/gotchas.html#label-based-slicing-conventions)) but no mention of this.\n"
