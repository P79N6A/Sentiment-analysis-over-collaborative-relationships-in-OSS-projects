I can't fully lay my hand on it, but I think it has something to do with combining regular/irregular timeseries.\n\nThe issue with the xlim not respecting the data is because it is updated by the last group (while this is a smaller group), and this is a seperate issue I think (you can open another issue for that).\n\nThe reason you get almost no points on the plot with `pivot` you seem to already figured out, this is indeed because of all the NaN values. You can also deal with this by plotting points instead of lines.\n"

    "body": "For a bit more detail, I think this is what's going on: \n\npandas uses special timeseries plotting if it can infer a \"periodic\" frequency from a series. While it takes a bit of digging, this is part of the `_use_dynamic_x()` check in tools/plotting.py:\n\n``` python\n    def _make_plot(self):\n        # this is slightly deceptive\n        if not self.x_compat and self.use_index and self._use_dynamic_x():\n            data = self._maybe_convert_index(self.data)\n            self._make_ts_plot(data)\n        else:\n...  # regular plotting\n```\n\nThis special tseries logic converts plotted series to use a PeriodIndex, and sets a \"base\" version of  the frequency on the axes object for later reference. (Note that x_compat disables all of this and uses regular, non-tseries plotting)\n\nThe first series to be plotted in my dataset (COL) gets a frequency of '5A-DEC', which can be converted to a period. In the timeseries plotting code the \"base\" version of this frequency ('A-DEC') gets assigned to the axes object.\n\nThe 3-item DatetimeIndex of 1997-12-31, 2003-12-31, and 2008-12-31 for the next series (PAN) has a surprising inferred frequency of 'WOM-5WED' since 1997, 2003, and 2008 all ended on a Wednesday (the 5th Wednesday of December). pandas can't convert frequencies like that to periods, so it uses regular plotting rather than the special timeseries plotting for that series, and its index is not converted to PeriodIndex. It doesn't try and use the axes frequency since it has already inferred a frequency for this series.\n\nThe next and final series (VEN) does not have an inferred frequency, so it inherits the axes frequency, and tries to use tseries plotting again. tseries plotting tries to re-calculate x_lim's to include all data, so it looks at the lines already plotted, but it assumes all existing lines will have PeriodIndex data. It blows up when it tries to call 'ordinal' on the DatetimeIndex entries from the earlier (PAN) series. \n\nI'm not sure what the right fix is here. Frequency inference clearly makes some interesting choices, that are relied on in other parts of the codebase. I'm not sure if either the frequency inference or the usage of it should be modified. Timeseries plotting should maybe tolerate non-PeriodIndex data when calculating x_lim, though I don't yet understand much of that code yet, e.g. why PeriodIndex is desirable.\n"
