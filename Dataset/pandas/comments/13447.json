    "body": "@jreback Just wondering why is is not a valid dtype? It denotes a scalar fixed-size binary blob, which `object` is not (more like a heterogenous collection of whatever).\n\nThere are cases where it's hard to find an alternative -- e.g., long fixed-size identifiers that may contain internal nulls, these you just store as `V*` so numpy doesn't mess with zero-termination. Also off top of my head, `h5py` maps `H5PY_OPAQUE` to `np.void`, both for reading and writing.\n\nIf this is really not meant to be ever supported, maybe Series should cast void to object for consistency purposes then? Just checked, that's what DataFrame / Index currently do.\n"
