    "body": "OK so let me summarize where this PR is at:\n1. Cython crashes on the Python 2 build only.  I haven't investigated this yet, because:\n2. @jreback seems to dislike the fact that new code is required to fix this problem, so:\n3. I posted a [question on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38770522/python-3-csv-writer-prints-bytes-with-prefix-and-quotes) to see if Python 3's `csv` module can be made to do the heavy lifting, but:\n4. Writing bytes without the prefixes and quotes does not seem to be supported in Python 3 directly.\n\nIt might be interesting to try to get support in Python 3.7 (or whatever) to write bytes as plain strings in the `csv` module.  But this would take a long time to reach Pandas users.  I do think the patch I've provided here is useful and appropriate, and I do not have a simpler one to offer.\n\nI hope we can get #9712 fixed somehow.  PRs welcome!  ;-)\n"

    "body": "@jzwinck Although the wording of @jreback was maybe a bit harsh on the 'relevant' aspect, there is a difference between \"relevant for you as a user\" and \"relevant enough in general to warrant additional code-complexity in pandas\" (and to be clear: I am not not saying it is one of either, just noting that it is debatable) \nI am not in a good position to judge its relevance as I don't have a personal use case for it, but if supporting writing bytes to csv without \"b\" for columns with all bytes (so not mixed) is less complex to implement (because you can use existing functionality), IMO it is seems better to start with that, as it probably already solves the main use cases?\n"
