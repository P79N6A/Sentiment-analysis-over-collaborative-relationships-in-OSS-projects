The bigger issue for me is that calling np.mean with a pandas DataFrame causes different behavior than with a numpy array.\r\n\r\nI don't know what exactly pandas is doing, but it shouldn't be modifying how numpy behavior, and that is still an issue in the latest version.  `\r\n\r\nI would expect\r\n```python\r\ndf=pd.DataFrame(np.zeros((30, 30))\r\nnp.mean(df.values), axis=0, keepdims=True).shape\r\n```\r\nTo give the same results as \r\n```python\r\nnp.mean(df.values), axis=0, keepdims=True).shape\r\n```\r\nBut the second line will throw an error.  If pandas can't give complete transparency when calling `np.mean` it shouldn't try to at all."

    "body": "> If pandas can't give complete transparency when calling np.mean it shouldn't try to at all.\r\n\r\nThat's how `np.mean` works. It checks the object for a `mean` method (and probably some other array-like characteristics that pandas meets) and then calls that object's mean. That's why `np.mean(df)` returns a Series, not a numpy array."
