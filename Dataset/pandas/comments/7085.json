Shouldn't it say `return self.read_csv(...)` here?\n\n``` python\nclass TestCParserHighMemory(ParserTests, tm.TestCase):\n\n    def read_csv(self, *args, **kwds):\n        kwds = kwds.copy()\n        kwds['engine'] = 'c'\n        kwds['low_memory'] = False\n        return read_csv(*args, **kwds)\n```\n- This not explain why there would be two exactly same-named methods in ParserTests.
