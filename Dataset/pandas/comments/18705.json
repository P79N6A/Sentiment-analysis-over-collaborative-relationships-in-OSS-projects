Not that I mind that particular behavior, it just doesn't seem obviously necessary."

    "body": "AFAICT a discussion with strong opinions occurred on this topic long before I got here.\r\n\r\n> it should not match np.datetime which does now in the current time zone which is completely wrong\r\n\r\nThis is confusing for a few reasons.\r\n\r\n1) `np.datetime64('now')` returns a UTC-based value but `np.datetime64('today')` returns a local-based value*.\r\n2) `to_datetime` returns a tz-naive object (assuming no tz kwarg is passed), but any TZ-aware strings are converted to their UTC values.  i.e. to_datetime is implicitly UTC.\r\n3) The stdlib `datetime.today()` is equivalent to `datetime.now()`, while one could reasonably expect it to be equivalent to `datetime.now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)`\r\n3b) `datetime.now(tz)` does not correspond to the current time in that timezone, but `datetime.now().replace(tzinfo=tz)`\r\n\r\n\\* Note: I now think I was wrong in the OP when I wrote that it rounds _the UTC time_ down to midnight; it apparently rounds the local time, i.e. `np.datetime64('today')` behaves like `datetime.today().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)`).\r\n\r\nGetting back to the hopefully-actionable topic, a summary of the status quo:\r\n\r\n- `to_datetime('now')` is not all that crazy because it is implicitly UTC and satisfies `to_datetime('now').value/1e9 == time.time()`.\r\n- `to_datetime('today')` is straight up wrong because of that same implicit-UTCness.  The only question is if we want it to continue rounding down to midnight (like `np.datetime64`) or just behave like \"now\" (like Timestamp).\r\n- Timestamp.now(), Timestamp('now'), Timestamp.today(), and Timestamp('today') are all _implicitly_ local. We should consider making that explicit.  This is a departure from the stdlib, but Timestamp.utcnow() already departs from datetime.utcnow().\r\n"
