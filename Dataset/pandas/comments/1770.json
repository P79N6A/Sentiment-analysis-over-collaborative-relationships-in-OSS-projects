    "body": "I was actually writing notes for myself about binning and grouping. \n\nhttp://nbviewer.maxdrawdown.com/3344040/binning%20and%20grouping.ipynb\n\nWhile the resampling/binning can be semantically the same as a groupby, they are implemented completely differently and that's why you're running into that quirk. \n\nThe M marks the edge at the end of the month. So in your exampe, 01/31 is an edge. Which means that two intervals are potentially claiming it. When closed=left, that means the interval on the right side of 01/31 has claim to it. When closed=right, the right interval is an empty set, which is the behavior you'd expect. \n\nYou'd run into the same issue but backwards if you used MonthStart. In that case the edge is on 01/01 and close=right would create a one-element set on the left. \n\nIf you want the label on the left, you probably want to change your offset to MS\n\n``` python\ntest1 = raw.resample('MS', how='count', closed='left', label='left')\ntest2 = raw.resample('MS', how='mean', closed='left', label='left')\n```\n\nNot sure what the phantom empty row is for on the closed=right, label=right. \n"
