    "body": "I'm not sure what the expected behaviour under DatetimeIndex.**add** is. I noticed that DatetimeIndex.equals() seems to compare the dates and ignores `freq` (this observation is based on behaviour without looking at the code). I in fact used this in the last batch of unit tests that I added. \n\nThe example you posted looks like a bug since the result isn't the same as `bdate_range('20130101', periods=10)`. Seems like DatetimeIndex.**add** acts like union but the `freq=='B'` should be dropped.\n\nIn terms of the `.holidays` and `.weekmask` attributes on `CustomBusinessDay`, I agree that it would be nice to have these as properties and any changes should be detected and cause the `busdaycalendar` to be updated. However this operation would invalidate anything that is marked as `freq=='C'` which raises the bigger issue of how to establish equality for parameterised DateOffsets like this? In my use case I just needed it to show up with any frequency at all and I make sure on my side that 'C' has a unique meaning everywhere. Given that this feature is very clearly marked 'experimental', do you think we can leave it at 'use at your own risk' for now?\n\nI'm sorry I can't commit any more time to this until the weekend and even then it's not likely that I'll get to it. Any chance we could open separate issues for these? I can squash the commits together but then have to move on.\n"
