The cache detection works ok on the master as the git history is never going to be rewritten. It is the same way it was working when the caching was being done externally, the only thing that has changed is that it has moved to travis. That being said it probably make sense to not use the git and use @gfyoung's idea of using the pyx file diff as that makes it more bullet proof. I could add to this PR to turn off the cython caching in non PRs too or just on the master branch. Or if there was a PR with a cython change to merge ready, that could be merged as a test.\n"
