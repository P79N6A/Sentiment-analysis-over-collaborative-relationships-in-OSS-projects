    "body": "Yep, sure!\n\nThe problem is, it just builds fine locally ... Tested it both on linux and windows. \n\nI think it has to do with this example:\n\n```\nIn [41]: a, b = 1, 2\n\nIn [42]: pd.eval('@a + b')\n  File \"<string>\", line unknown\nSyntaxError: The '@' prefix is not allowed in top-level eval calls, \nplease refer to your variables by name without the '@' prefix\n```\n\nBecause it is a syntax-error, which seems to have some different error traceback than other errors\n"
