    "body": "yeah that should coerce to `object`. Right now we are promoting a boolean with nulls -> float64\n\nthis is somewhat deep in there. need to look inside `core/internals/Block.setitem`. where `_maybe_promote` is called. Bools have not gotten much love lately.\n\nThough to be fair we do this similar to how we do ints with NA's, meaning we cast to floats.\n\nSo not sure how much this is relied upon in the real world.\n"
