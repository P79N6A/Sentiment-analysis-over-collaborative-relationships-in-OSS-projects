    "body": "this is the same issue as in #9946 (same because the same underlying cython routine is used)\n\nyou will notice that using `lambda x: x.copy()` is the same result.\n\npandas is trying to infer whether you have mutated things (or not), by comparing indexes. This is prob a bug, but this is a bit of a rabbit hole as I think the best thing to do would actually to ban this entirely (mutation). So the outputs can be more predictible. You are welcome to dig-in!.\n"
