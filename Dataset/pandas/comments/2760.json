    "body": "I think this is expected behaviour.  When you operate on the two Series, they're aligned on the index.  `s[1:]` has 1 through 4, and `s[:-1]` 0 through 3.   So you wind up with zero as a result where there are common indices (1,2,3), and NaN where the subtraction is undefined because of a missing value (0,4).  \n\nEither `s.diff()[1:]` or `(s-s.shift())[1:]`, staying with Series, or `s.values[1:] - s.values[:-1]`, dropping to arrays like you did, should give the numbers you're looking for.\n"

    "body": "Hey @dsm054, I really appreciate your reply. Haha. Wow, you know, I'll just think I'll get out my sharpie now to write across the top of my laptop to not post issues late at night.... After not looking away from a screen for 14 hours and a few :cocktail:, one can get issue trigger happy. You're right, it is expected behavior (intrinsic to pandas' beauty, in fact), and [noted from the first paragraph explaining pandas data structures](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/dsintro.html):\n\n> Here is a basic tenet to keep in mind: **data alignment is intrinsic**. The link between labels and data will not be broken unless done so explicitly by you.\n\nThanks for taking the time to note this and do know that it wasn't in vainâ€”I am smarter. Regarding myself and posting issues, a basic tenet to keep in mind: **sit on it until the next morning**. \nSorry for the noise. Closed. Keep calm, carry on.\n"
