But I think I'll just check for a `.ndim` attribute. It does this to figure out whether to return the object or iterate thru additional dimensions.\n"

I think it was some flavor of 0.13; I don't recall going to 0.14.0 on the system I was using.\n\nAnd I know I should use `.loc` for indexing. Using the \"wrong\" idiom was just  a handy way to discover and demonstrate the issue.\n"
