    "body": "I think there's a bug in the logic here. It's hard-coded to assume that there are 4 quarters in a year (did I just type that?)\n\nhttps://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/tseries/offsets.py#L1126\n\nGiven a date of 1-1-2014 when the last offset should be 10-1-2013 and the next 4-1-2014. IIRC, the original designed behavior is to roll forward until you're on the offset then do the addition. So `ts + offset` should give 10-1-2014 right? \n"
