    "body": "@jreback : From a maintenance perspective, having to keep all of these signatures updated is kind of annoying, especially since all that `Series.to_csv` does is call `DataFrame.to_csv`.  Is there a way that we could create one function (similar to how we implement `DataFrame.merge` for example) that we can then call for both `Series` and `DataFrame` and then not have to replicate the signature everywhere?"

    "body": "@gfyoung not like ``merge``, rather it is straightforward to move the ``.to_csv`` functions to ``generic.py`` to accomplish this, though its slightly tricky because the doc-string needs to be reflexive of the class (e.g. say Series or DataFrame) as appropriate, but that can be accomplished thru shared_kwargs , but that itself is a cost, e.g. look at ``.reindex`` we *still* define it in ``series.py`` though we use *args, **kwargs (we could/should actually write down the signature here though).\r\n\r\nso yes I think it is possible to be simpler / less error prone. but you have to pick your poison a bit. e.g. we can share doc-strings and simpl pretty easy, the signature itself is slightly tricker.\r\n\r\nthat said I think we *should* move the ``.to_csv`` impl to generic. pls create an issue (and if you want to create a more general issue about doing this, though IIRC there might be one already)."
