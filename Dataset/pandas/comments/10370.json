Should change the picture, and I will add the other core devs access.\n\n> Should we use a 'dev' channel on anaconda.org for the nightly builds?\n- its actually simpler to get it from `pandas` but can do this. I think @cpcloud had some arguments about this for `blaze`.\n\n> Should the generated _version.py be included in git?\n- yes its included in the repo.\n\n> So there is no place in the code (as now in setup.py) anymore where you have to change a number for the release? Does it get it then from the git tags?\n- yes it gets it from the git tag (AND it save it when the tagging happens / sdist and such), so that it will work in dev and production. The original code (what I deleted), basically did this, but versioneer handles all of the edge cases (as well as makes the string formatting configurable).\n"

I just recommended it to a colleague who had to install a dev version and didn't have git installed (but it was for a pure python package, I wouldn't recommend it for pandas).\n\nIf I read the versioneer explanation, I understand that on the moment `git archive` is performed, the version tag is inserted in the `pandas/_version.py` file. I tried this with your branch, but if I download the archive, the lines:\n\n```\n    git_refnames = \"$Format:%d$\"\n    git_full = \"$Format:%H$\"\n```\n\nare replaced by:\n\n```\n    git_refnames = \" (build)\"\n    git_full = \"6b1055c765c488e6fb411eed452abf75ff8df4bb\"\n```\n\nSo the commit hash is included, but I don't see any mention of 0.16.2.
