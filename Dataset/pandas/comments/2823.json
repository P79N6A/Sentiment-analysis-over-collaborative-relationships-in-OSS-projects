    "body": "Interesting. \n\nNumPy's reshape accepts multiple arguments as well as tuples - although the documentation seems only to mention tuples.\n\nPandas Series apparently will work only with tuples. I suppose this is OK as perhaps the fact that NumPy accepts multiple arguments is not officially supported, as it's not documented. However, do note that many users are familiar with the non-tuple usage (as an example, that's how it is in the NumPy tutorial on the SciPy page: c = arange(24).reshape(2,3,4)\n\nAnyway, I guess at least I now know the proper way of doing it.  \n"
