    "body": "Thanks for the reply. Could you please run through my example in my original post?\r\n\r\nThe resample method in Pandas inherently assumes that the input data is an aggregate value from the last timestamp to the current timestamp as resample is a simple grouping of timestamp indexes. When data represents instantaneous/discrete values at a particular time, this simple grouping of time indexes for resampling is insufficient as there must be an interpolation assumption to fill in all the times between the instantaneous values. In it's simplest form, a linear interpolation between the points would then represent the mean value over that time period, which then could be fed to the resample method.\r\n\r\nVisual representations of the data and the assumptions in the pandas resample method are in the following...\r\n\r\nThe actual data from the earlier example...with the points representing instantaneous values:\r\n\r\n![figure_1-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2656596/46064992-09af4680-c1c5-11e8-84de-4196160beeff.png)\r\n\r\nIf the Pandas resample method was applied, then this is what the data would represent if `closed='left'`:\r\n\r\n![figure_1-8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2656596/46067001-e1761680-c1c9-11e8-9e24-f47fb5048637.png)\r\n\r\nAnd `closed='right'`:\r\n\r\n![figure_1-9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2656596/46067050-feaae500-c1c9-11e8-8ca5-b2357b20969b.png)\r\n\r\nAnd what would be assumed with a linear interpolation:\r\n\r\n![figure_1-10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2656596/46067110-28640c00-c1ca-11e8-8c57-afd84e471ff2.png)\r\n\r\nor also (as a comparison to the previous two):\r\n\r\n![figure_1-7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2656596/46066880-9e1ba800-c1c9-11e8-9889-2a002f424716.png)\r\n\r\nI hope that's a bit more clear...although I might have just confused you more :(\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
