    "body": "> Yes, that's exactly what happened to me yesterday.\r\n\r\nOK, so IIUC you're making a change that doesn't actually break `conversion` internally, but gives a mangled error message on `import pandas as pd`:\r\n\r\n`ImportError: C extension: pandas._libs.tslibs.conversion does not export expected C function convert_to_tsobject not built. If you want to import pandas from the source directory, you may need to run 'python setup.py build_ext --inplace --force' to build the C extensions first.`\r\n\r\nThat error is re-raised in `pandas/__init__.py`, which seems to incorrectly assume that the build state is binary.  If the failed import is taken outside of the try/except block, the exception message is:\r\n\r\n`ImportError: pandas._libs.tslibs.conversion does not export expected C function convert_to_tsobject`\r\n\r\nIn this particular failure mode, this error message is pretty helpful.  In fact, it is more helpful than the error message we would get if we added conversion.pxd to tslib's `'pxdfile'` list in setup.py:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError compiling Cython file:\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n...\r\nfrom numpy cimport ndarray, int64_t\r\n\r\nfrom tslibs.conversion cimport convert_to_tsobject\r\n^\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\npandas/_libs/tslib.pxd:3:0: 'pandas/_libs/tslibs/conversion/convert_to_tsobject.pxd' not found\r\n[...]\r\n[26 lines of less helpful information to scroll back up past to find the real error]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I can put together a PR that will exhaustively list in setup.py all of the pxdfiles relevant to every cython module.  Then we can vigilantly keep that up to date.  OR I can fix the error message in `__init__`.  The former has the benefit of raising at build-time, but the latter is less vulnerable to future leakage.  (Longer-term I'm hoping cython catches this at build-time)."

    "body": "One last-ditch argument for the \"fix the import error message\" solution.\r\n\r\nListing these all in setup.py is asking for trouble.  There is plenty of evidence that the deps listed in the `ext_data` dict do not get updated when the actual modules are changed.  Until recently the `tslib` entry had '_libs/lib' in its 'pxdfiles' entry, while the `lib` entry did not (and does not) have `tslib` in its 'pxdfiles' (or 'depends') entries; i.e. the exact opposite of what the dependencies _actually_ are.\r\n\r\nQuick: which entries get '_libs/src/foo' and which get 'pandas/_libs/src/foo'?  Does the entry for `lib` need to explicitly list out its recursive dependencies (as it kinda-sorta does by including `tseries_depends`  in its 'depends' entry)?  Does '_libs/src/util' belong under 'depends' or 'pxdfiles' (under the status quo it is inconsistent)?  How does the inclusion of `common_include` affect any of this?\r\n\r\nMy point being: the `ext_data` dictionary is Frankensteined together and we should be working to get stuff _out_ of it rather than dump more stuff in (e.g. #18059).\r\n\r\nFor modules in `src` we _do_ need to specify in setup where to look for things.  For regular cython modules we can let imports fail _in the exact same way_ as python imports fail."

    "body": "For testing purposes I've implemented tslibs as effectively a standalone packages.  The setup.py for this package is relatively simple, the relevant bits being\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport Cython\r\nfrom Cython.Build import cythonize\r\n\r\nexts = [\r\n    [...]\r\n    Extension(\"tslibs.conversion\",\r\n              sources=[\"tslibs/conversion.pyx\"],\r\n              include_dirs=[np.get_include()],\r\n              define_macros=macros),\r\n    [...]\r\n]\r\n\r\nsetup(name='tslibs',\r\n           [...],\r\n           cmdclass={'build_ext': Cython.Distutils.build_ext},\r\n           ext_modules=cythonize(exts, compiler_directives=directives))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason I bring this up is because when I run setup.py build_ext --inplace I see a bunch of messages:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCompiling tslibs/npy_dtime.pyx because it depends on tslibs/npy_dtime.pxd.\r\nCompiling tslibs/period.pyx because it depends on tslibs/npy_dtime.pxd.\r\nCompiling tslibs/api.pyx because it changed.\r\nCompiling tslibs/timestamps.pyx because it depends on tslibs/npy_dtime.pxd.\r\n```\r\n\r\ni.e. it looks very much like cython is doing some kind of caching and dependency recognition internally."

Two key points from the answer:\r\n\r\n- Conditional on using Cython's `build_ext`, this is apparently the appropriate way to specify dependencies.\r\n\r\n- Doing so is outdated.  Using `cythonize` will handle most of this on its own.\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cython-users/YdGpGqi6Qw4"
