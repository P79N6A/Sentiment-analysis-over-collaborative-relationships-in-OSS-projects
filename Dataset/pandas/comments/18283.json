The converter wasn't deprecated, it's just no longer registered as a side effect of `import pandas`. To revert that change (and register it on import) we'll need to import matplotlib when someone does `import pandas`. But we want to avoid that, since that increases pandas' own import time.

I underestimated the number of people relying on a pandas import modifying matplotlib's state. If you're looking for a solution, this is compatible going back a long ways:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pandas.tseries import converter\r\nconverter.register()\r\n\r\n# your plotting stuff\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn general though, the old way of doing things wasn't great. I don't think an `import pandas` should modify matplotlib's global state, potentially squashing custom formatters someone else had already registered for datetimes.\r\n\r\n>  until there is basic support in matplotlib itself for datetime64 data (if there would be a clear timeline for that)\r\n\r\nMatplotlib 2.2 in January hopefully.\r\n\r\n"
