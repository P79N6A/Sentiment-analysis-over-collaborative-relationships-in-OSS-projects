    "body": "OK, after digging more deeply into it.... I discover that `M` corresponds to the offset \"month end\", which apparently means the start of the last day of the month. To get \"month start\", I need to use `MS` (or likewise, `QS` or `AS`).\n\nThis is... deeply non-intuitive.\n\nI wish there was a way to change this without breaking a bunch of existing code.\n\nI suppose we could add `ME`, etc., for month end, but changing the offset `M` from month-end to month-start seems like a non-starter. Ugh. So I guess we're left with a documentation issue (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/5023), unless we want to add a hack for resample.\n"

    "body": "IIRC `M` matches what `scikit-timeseries` established, a long established pattern. You _could_ change it but that would prob require a long deprecation cycle (IMHO not worth it).\n\nalso xref to #9528 as the fill args to `.resample` are different from up/down resampling. Further I think the docs to resample need much more. my2c.\n"
