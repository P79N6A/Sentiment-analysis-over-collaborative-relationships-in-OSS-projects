What I mean is that I\noften need to get the values directly out of the series, and in doing so\nI generally have to transform from/back to seconds for various reasons.\n\nIncidentally, when I work with experiments from microbiology, I always\nuse relative times (as in ms from experiment start). Because of this, I\nnever had much use of the subsecond resolution in timestamps so far.\n"
