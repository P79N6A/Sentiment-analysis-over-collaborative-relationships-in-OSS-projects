I don't know if we can use `conda`, because all things we are integrating would be required to use it or we would need to make some strange pip/conda mixing.\n\nAnyway, it doesn't bother us at the moment, because we were just checking out one component, but if we'll need to automate things, then I'll maybe try to fix this. You know, I just wanted to let you know.\n"
