You cannot rely on a range, too ambiguous. \r\n\r\nFor example, why is a year a sufficient number of observations to consider the index a date and not a very long id? Think of any population census with >32 mln people.\r\n\r\nThere is another problem here: the amount of arguments `json_read()` accepts. Some of them are unclear in what they do but mostly it's unclear how they interact, e.g. why `dtype` is only for columns?\r\n\r\n\r\n"
