    "body": "Thanks for the comments. My motive for doing this was that quite a lot of people (including us!) use the `dateutil` library quite extensively. Whilst you can construct a Pandas `Timestamp` with a dateutil time zone any attempt to convert to another `dateutil` time zone will fail:\n\n``` python\n>>> ts = pd.Timestamp('2013-08-30 12:00', tz=dateutil.tz.gettz('US/Eastern'))\n>>> ts.astimezone(tz=dateutil.tz.gettz('US/Pacific'))\nException AttributeError: \"'NoneType' object has no attribute 'toordinal'\" in 'pandas.tslib._localize_tso' ignored\n<Timestamp: 2013-08-30 16:00:00>\n```\n\nThis seems to be little dangerous for `dateutil` users. It looks like there are three solutions, either:\n(a) Support `dateutil` time zones fully.\n(b) Convert `dateutil` time zones internally to `pytz` timezones.\n(c) Refuse to accept `dateutil` time zones.\n\nThis issue does (a) and seems to be a small change to be able to inter-operate with both the time zone libraries in common use.\n\nAn alternative is (b), with some small performance impact, which would mean working out the correspondence between dateutil and pytz. Something like:\n\n``` python\npytz.timezone('/'.join(du_tz._filename.split('/')[-2:]))\n```\n\nwould work but there are some corner cases like UTC.\n\nI do realise that you may want to remove a dependency on `dateutil` entirely in which case (c) would be the solution but this would be a bit disappointing for those that have lots of other code depending on `dateutil`!\n"
