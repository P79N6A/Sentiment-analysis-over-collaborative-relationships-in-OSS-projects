More of an annoyance but still...\n\nI'd also suggest not changing/setting default values for kwargs when to_clipboard is called, seems confusing at best and I think functionality is unchanged (proposed fix in https://github.com/jlou2u/pandas/commit/01277af698e80027340efda46666fad42fc0edd7 that includes pijucha's change)\n\nI haven't done anything with travis before but looking at .travis.yml it seems that xsel is only added onto python 3 builds, but not python 2 builds.  I think pandas.util.clipboard will raise import error if it can't find a clipboard utility and test_clipboard.py will raise nose.SkipTest(\"no clipboard found\") if it can't find a clipboard.  That's my best guess at why this can't be reproduced in the builds.\n"

The test fails because to_clipboard fails for the data frame and it falls back to the string to clipboard. The to_clipboard fails because, we are trying to encode from ascii to utf8 when we call encode, but the str is already in UTF-8 when we have non ascii characters in the dataframe, hence when it tries to read the non ascii character using ascii, we get a UnicodeDecodeError.
