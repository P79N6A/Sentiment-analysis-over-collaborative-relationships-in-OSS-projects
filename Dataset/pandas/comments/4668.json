    "body": "Most legacy Fortran 77 based simulators (of which many still are actively used in different scientific communities) such as [TOUGH2](http://esd.lbl.gov/research/projects/tough/), (which I've had the pleasure of working with extensively), often have data input file subroutines that have hardcoded fields widths. This makes life interesting, and often as much time is spent in **pre** processing as in post processing. Scientists I worked with had folders of rigid bash scripts and _even Fortran routines_ to attempt to manage these 'input decks' creation—oh the scientist-hours lost. :cry:.\n\nInput decks can contain information such as mesh geometry and physical properties, system initial conditions (i.e., thermodynamic state of each element and transport states between them), and simulator operation parameters. While it's often the case that pandas is used to analyze measured or resultant data, I certainly could envision using it to manipulate input files (indeed, I wrote an entire perl library to do this, before discovering python and pandas). With functionality to manage such input decks, it is fundamental to have fixed width output. \n\nClearly there are much better ways to interact with fortran libraries (f2py / numpy) but I can tell you that (some) scientists are simply interested in getting a simulation up and running. If pandas already has them hooked for data analysis use, there could be a large benefit from such functionality. If had I access to such a tool, my graduate student life would have been a who lot more social :wink:.\n"

In that case, the formatting code detects if all of the values in the index do not contain times in which cases it only formats the date component. See:\n\n```\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'a':[datetime.datetime(2013,1,1)]}, index=pd.to_datetime([datetime.datetime(2013,1,1)]))\nio = StringIO()\ndf.to_csv(io)\n\nIn [12]: print io.getvalue()\n,a\n2013-01-01,2013-01-01 00:00:00\n```\n\nI would suggest having some way how to format datetime w/o time different from datetime with times.\n"

    "body": "@jreback re: extra spaces between columns in DataFrame.to_string. not long after my posting I dug into the pandas/core/format.py module where to_string is located under the DataFrameFormater class. I found that there are a few calls to a method \"self.adj.adjoin\" where the first argument should be an integer for the number of spaces between columns and the second are the columns themselves. most of the calls to this method are hardcoded and the col_space argument in the \"to_string\" method seems to actually go un-used. \n\nso I added these lines to DataFrameFormatter.**init**()\n\n```\n    #set col_space to zero if custom formaters provided and\n    #no col_space provided.\n    self.col_space = col_space\n    if formatters is not None and col_space is None:\n        self.col_space = 0\n    elif col_space is None:\n        self.col_space = 1\n```\n\nthen replaced the hard-coded values to self.adj.adjoin with self.col_space and it seemed to work both with formatters or specifying a number of spaces to the col_space argument\n\nI just got a development environment setup for pandas per the user instructions and noticed that the format module is missing from pandas/core and is now in a subpackage called formatters. This would be my first pull request and I want to do things right and write my tests first.\n\nQ1 Where would I find any tests related to the to_string functionality as I don't see a test folder under the new formatters sub-package?\n\nQ2. Could the extra space issue #4158 be separated out from this bigger issue so it can be referenced from the pull request. (you can wait till I actually submit the request)?\n\nThanks!\n"
