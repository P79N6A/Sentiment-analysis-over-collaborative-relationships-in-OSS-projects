    "body": "Your example is comparing apples to oranges. You are reducing from 4->3 dims from Panel4D->Panel, but 3->2 for the Panel->DataFrame.\n\nHowever, you have noticed that a reduction to ndim==2 when using axis='items' (the 0th axis), their IS a transpose of dimensions.\n\nThis is for compatibility with how DataFrames are constructed. I think this was a historical convience that just kept going. And their are various transpose ops scattered throught the code-base.\n\nIts present with indexing as well. \n\n```\np = \nIn [1]: p = Panel(np.arange(3*4*5).reshape(3,4,5))\n\nIn [8]: p.iloc[0].shape\nOut[8]: (4, 5)\n\nIn [9]: p.iloc[:,0].shape\nOut[9]: (5, 3)\n\nIn [10]: p.iloc[:,:,0].shape\nOut[10]: (4, 3)\n\nIn [11]: p.shape\nOut[11]: (3, 4, 5)\n```\n"
