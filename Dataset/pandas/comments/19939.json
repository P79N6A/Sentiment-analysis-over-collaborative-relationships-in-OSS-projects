Adding them fixed the issue above and the other issue I found.\r\n\r\nHappy to add a whatsnew, just wasn't sure which version this would target. Didn't add any tests because it doesn't appear any of the other index compat configs are being tested (unless I'm missing something), but I'm happy to put in a test for these if you think it's appropriate."
