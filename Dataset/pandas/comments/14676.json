    "body": "> But since we don't support that ATM, passing an 'empty' Categorical is prob reasonable.\n\nCan you clarify that? Are you saying anywhere we currently allow `dtype='category'`, we really mean `dtype=pd.Categorical()`? Because I don't think those are the same. The `dtype='category`' is on a higher level than any instance of the type, including an empty `Categorical`. I could be misunderstanding though.\n"

I'll do some thinking / researching on how other languages handle this.\n"
