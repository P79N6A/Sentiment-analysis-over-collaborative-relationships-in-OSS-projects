    "body": "Hello jreback,\n\nThanks for the reply. After reading the discussion my impression is that pandas is already doing a simultaneous unstack, and considering the optional argument 'sequentially' was not added for unstack, I shouldn't do anything additional to get that behavior. Still I am not able to get the second table properly grouped. Maybe I am missing something.\n\nbest!\n"
