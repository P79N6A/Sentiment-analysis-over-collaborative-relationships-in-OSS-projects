In terms of adding `expanding()` examples, `expanding().sum()` and `cumsum()` are the same thing, so I added `expanding().median()` instead. \r\n\r\nMy plan was to use remaining space on second page for `groupby()`, and after that is done, I'll look for space for `.rolling()` and `.resample()`.

I wish there was a way to change all column names when using method chaining. \r\n\r\nI'm space constrained to add `.dropna` to \"Subset Variables\" and to move `.drop` to \"Subset Variables\".

Nowhere else in the cheat sheet do I have info about how pandas manages dates and times, so without that context, putting in `.resample` becomes difficult to explain. I think it would also need downsampling and upsampling examples.  So space becomes a bigger issue.\r\n\r\nWith respect to conversion, I have Powerpoint on Windows, and it has an export PDF feature. Scripting would be operating system dependent (and probably not worth the time to figure out). So I will just document how to do it in a text file.\r\n\r\nOne other question - once published, where would links to the cheat sheet exist? On the pandas.pydata.org web site?  Or from within the documentation itself?  If the latter, how do we refer to something outside the documentation tree?\r\n"

    "body": "@Dr-Irv Really cool work! Thanks a lot for this!\r\n\r\nI have some comments, but will save them for later. Just a quick one: I think the `zdf`dataframe on the second page (bottom right corner, \"Set like operations\") is not correct. Shouldn't also have the x2 column instead of x3? (otherwise the example results are not correct).\r\n\r\nRegarding how to include this into pandas: another possibility is that you keep it in a pandas-cheatsheet repo from your own instead of putting it into pandas code base itself. But then of course include the same clear links to it in the pandas documentation as in the other case. \r\nTwo reasons I propose this: first, you keep more the credit and ownership of it. Second, what exactly is included will always be a bit subjective / based on personal taste. And I would like to avoid such discussion (although useful to see feelings about certain functionality, eg I rather use rename instead of assigning columns directly) on the main pandas issue tracker (it's already crowded enough :-)). In your repo you just make the final decision. \r\nBut if you would like to see it included in the pandas codebase (and not only link to it), that's fine for me as well.\r\n\r\n"
