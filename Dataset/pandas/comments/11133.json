For example, it didn't even respect the `coerce` flag, and has wierd dependencies between types (since it tries one, moves on to the next,etc, and so it not robust to lots of reasonable refactorings).\n\nI think there are two ways forward:\n1. add `to_numeric` to there is a `to_datetime` and `to_timestamp` which completes the set.  Start deprecation of `convert_objects`\n2. Move new version to `convert` and start deprecation.\n\nIn principle adding `to_numeric` and `convert` aren't orthogonal, so both could be done.\n"

I think it might simply be best to just use kind of what this PR does. E.g. map the original arguments, if no `coerce` is specified, then it should work, if not, refuse to guess and just raise. Further I think let's simply deprecate the entire function (`.convert_objects`).\n\nYes this will break code, but it will loudly do it and I think only a very very small subset of users will experience this. We cannot cleanly do this as the fundamental behavior is changed. I suppose could revert to the original behavior, but simplest/easiest from this point is just raise.\n"

The other `to_` live in time series specific modules.\n"
