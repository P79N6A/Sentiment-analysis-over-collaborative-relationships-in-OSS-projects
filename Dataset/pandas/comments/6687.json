Sklearn didn't provide more statistics metrics like statsmodels. And for me, statsmodels are more friendly for pandas than sklearn, actually when I use pandas and sklearn I need to transfer pandas to NDarrays.\nTo be honest, I don't know whether this function is in the scope of pandas.

There are other reasons to split a dataframe in two apart from train/test dataset.\n- But indeed, maybe we should think more in general if this kind of functions belong in pandas, or in sklearn/statsmodels/seperate project... or in a module in pandas. I also think we should be precautious with overloading dataframe/series too much with adding more methods.\n\nSee also https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels/issues/1498 to ask to add this to statsmodels\n"
