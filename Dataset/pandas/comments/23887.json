    "body": "I don't think this makes sense. The default `pd.MultiIndex` constructor intentionally mirrors the under-lying data-structure (in terms of `levels` and `codes`). It's OK if users don't use the constructor directly -- we can aways make convenience functions for that (which indeed already exist). We could even make a new \"try everything\" converter function `pd.to_multiindex()`, though I'm not sure how you could reliably distinguish `from_tuples` from `from_arrays`.\r\n\r\nThere is no iron-clad rule that a class's repr needs to use its constructor directly -- we could make the repr show `MultiIndex.from_tuples(...)` if desired. The situation is pretty similar to that for `np.ndarray` (with its low-level constructor) and `np.array` (which is used in the repr).\r\n\r\nIf you did go ahead with this, what would you do with the existing constructor? Would you delegate the existing constructor to another method, or would you simply overload the first argument `levels` to check for a list of tuples? This sort of heavy overloading makes code harder to understand and error check (either manually or with static checks like mypy/pylint)."
