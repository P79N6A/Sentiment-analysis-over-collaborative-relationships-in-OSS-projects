    "body": "Some thoughts:\n- I think already a good goal to work towards would be to expand the docstrings.  \n  For me it's one of the main issue with tha pandas docs at the moment to have better docstrings. I had a draft issue to submit about this (to start the dicsussion about this, and to see how we could engage the community), but did not yet finish it. \n- So if we want \"a catalog of code examples by method\", I think we should start with the docstrings rather than a new section in the docs (and make sure we link often to the docstrings in the docs)\n- How do you envisage the template/automation to make it easier to contribute? I'm not fuly understanding what you're saying?  \n  Some web interface where people could provide examples without the need to learn git/submit PR? (maybe see also this https://github.com/pv/pydocweb/tree/master/doc and http://docs.scipy.org/numpy/Front%20Page/ which is something in this direction for numpy/scipy. But it seems it's not used that much anymore (in favor of PRs via github I assume)) Or have a seperate file with these example which are inserted in the docstrings (to prevent the docstrings in the code itself becomes to large)?\n- What do you mean with \"making it easilyy accessible while working in ipython\"?\n\nBut improving the docs in this area is important, and certainly worth thinking about this how we could best handle it.\n"

    "body": "easily accessible in ipython means just that. That while coding, you can launch\nthe examples page for a method directly from the session.\n\nI was not proposing a new section in the docs, but a new doc sub-project.\nIt's easier to build a system that enforces structured examples which we\ncan process, then it is to accept docstring changes and then extract out\njust the relevent bits and turn them into web pages.\n\nBeyond a certain length, I don't think docstrings are useful, I certainly\nstruggle with them in ipython. webpages can be much more detailed\nand better presented.\n\nLinking from the docs to docstrings is a bizarre idea IMO, the converse \nis not, nor is `pd.apropos(df.merge)` -> launch firefox.\n\nBut perhaps docstrings are a fine solution and doing something more \nelaborate is going too far.\n\nI'll close, we can pick it up someday if we want to.\n"
