I am able to do something similar without trouble for float64 types (not shown below), but I can't get it to work for variable-length byte arrays.  These byte arrays will eventually become strings but I don't want to do the conversion here because we give the user the option to retain the raw bytes.  The error message I am getting is copied below the code.  \n\nI have also tried typing `string_chunk` as `object[:, ::1]` but that didn't work either.\n\n```\ncdef void process_byte_array_with_data(object parser, int offset, int length,\n                                       uint8_t[:, ::1] byte_chunk,\n                                       np.ndarray string_chunk):\n    # ...\n    bvec = bytearray(source[start:start+lngt])\n    string_chunk[js, parser._current_row_in_chunk_index] = bvec\n```\n\n```\nBufferError: Object is not writable.\nException ignored in: 'pandas.io.sas.saslib.process_byte_array_with_data'\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"stringsource\", line 616, in View.MemoryView.memoryview_cwrapper (pandas/io/sas/saslib.c:14511)\n  File \"stringsource\", line 323, in View.MemoryView.memoryview.__cinit__ (pandas/io/sas/saslib.c:10880)\n```\n"
