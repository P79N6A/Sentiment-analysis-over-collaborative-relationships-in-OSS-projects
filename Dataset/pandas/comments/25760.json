    "body": "> One issue is that if this arithmetic is allowed which solution should this op return?\r\n\r\nIf all operations after that \"align on both row and column labels\" as [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) says, then picking which to return is not important. It's like picking which order to use for lists that represent sets.\r\nConversely, if order is important (and not labels), then documentation of DataFrame has to be changed.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to change behavior of align - currently it puts common columns before others. It's a problem because even if I try to use a consistent order of columns in my application, it gets jumbled by operations that use align. E.g., if I have `X` and `Y` both with columns `a` and `b`, and `Z` with column `b`, then `(X+Z)+Y` will fail, as `X+Z` will have columns `b` and `a` (in this order)."
