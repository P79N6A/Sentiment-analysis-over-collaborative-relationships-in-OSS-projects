    "body": "Interesting suggestion. That said, it can't really have the same semantics, because mode() does not actually reduce the dimensionality (ie the mode of a Series is still 1D rather than a scalar like mean or min).\n\nSo would you expect mode() to be more equivalent to a transform? (ie grouped data frame - - > data frame) \n"
