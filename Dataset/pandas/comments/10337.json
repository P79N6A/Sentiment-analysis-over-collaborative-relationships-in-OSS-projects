    "body": "@jreback, sure I'll write a test.  I have a piece of code that reliably segfaults for me:\n\n```\nss = pd.Series([], index=pd.DatetimeIndex([]), dtype=np.object)\nss.resample('d', how='count')\n```\n\nThat being said, this doesn't mean it'll reliably segfault for other machines since out-of-bounds access are undefined behavior.  One way would be to re-enable the bounds-checking on these Cython functions just for the unit tests.  (I actually posed [this question](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/286726/134794) on Programmers Stack Exchange and they seemed surprised that the disabling of bounds-checking was hard-coded rather than something that can be switched on and off)\n"

    "body": "@Garrett-R then that is a reasonable test. Even if it doesn't segfault on some platforms that is ok. Note that you _can_ change the directive at run-time, see [here](http://docs.cython.org/src/reference/compilation.html#how-to-set-directives), e.g. you would have a flag that is passed in to re-enable this. But to be honest it is overkill, and not necessary to tests with that. Since you have an example that fails, that can serve as a smoke tests (e.g. the test is simply running that code, if it doesn't segfault then the test passes). \n"
