    "body": "@grahamjeffries see my comment https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/8000#issuecomment-55135768\n\nAny interest in doing a fix? I don't think we need to add `left` and `right` kwds to `.interpolate()` like `np.interp` has. We already have `.fillna` which is better for these things. I'd say we can add a keyword like `extrapolate` or `extend` or something like that to control whether things get filled on.\n\nRight now we can just keep it as `extrapolate=True` (for compatibility), but warn that it may change in the future and recommend that people set it to false and `fillna` after interpolating.\n\nI can take this if you aren't able/interested.\n"
