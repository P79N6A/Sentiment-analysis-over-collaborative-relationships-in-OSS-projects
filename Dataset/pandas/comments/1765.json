The second one will return shape 4,1,2 because indexing by loc will follow normal slice behavior. \n\nThe problem is that the minor axis in your example is an IntIndex. So it tries to match by label first, which works so it's inclusive. \n"

    "body": "That makes sense - I assumed the date ranges were the minor & minor axis but obviously the first one was getting assigned to items.\n\nI can see that having an inclusive end point makes sense for a slice of an unordered index, but it's a bit surprising for a date index and is different to what I'm used to from `scikits.timeseries`. I guess that ship has sailed however and there's no chance that DatetimeIndexes will be treated specially so as to not include the endpoint.\n\nI don't think there's an actual bug here - just my incorrect understanding/intuition so I'll close the issue.\n"
