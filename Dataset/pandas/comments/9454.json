    "body": "The problem here is that `np.asarray([(1, 1), (1, 2), (0, 0), (1, 2)])` creates a 2D array, not a 1D array of tuples. We were actually just discussing this on the numpy mailing list today: http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2015-February/072240.html\n\nSo to work around this, you could supply an ndarray of tuples directly. Then things should still work.\n\nIf you want to fix this in pandas (and yes, PRs are always greatly appreciated!), we could cast the input to   factorize with the internal routine `_asarray_tuplesafe` from `pandas.core.common` instead of `np.asarray`.\n"
