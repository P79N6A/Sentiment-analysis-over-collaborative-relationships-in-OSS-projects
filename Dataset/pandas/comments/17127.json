We're currently at `0.20.3` right now.\r\n\r\n* The code you provided is unfortunately not reproducible for us.  Could you provide a self-contained code snippet that we can run to reproduce your issue?"

    "body": "@gfyoung Thanks for your replying.\r\n- I can't upgrade to `0.20.3` because the listed code is mini part of a big project\r\n- In fact I tried to reproduce it but failed by appending a new row and update several  fields and repeated for thousands of times.  If i can reproduce, i will debug into the source code. As i mentioned , What confused me most is that why the field `orderStatus`  success but the field `tradedVolume` failed. They're on the same column and with the same update method.  \r\n"
