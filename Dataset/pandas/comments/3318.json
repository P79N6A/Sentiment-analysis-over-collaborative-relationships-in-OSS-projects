    "body": "Gah, sorry man.  I even referenced the docs before posting this issue.  I'm really trying to get a viable workflow going and I'm very close.  As for how to handle the np.nans being dropped, what do you think about storing the index in a StoreManager class.  When an object is requested form the store, it is reindexed using the original, complete index.   Something like this StoreManager class is what I'm working on.  Thanks again for your help and sorry for the noob questions.\n"
