    "body": "So you actually want to change alpha each iteration?  \n\nYes that is exactly correct ewma can be thought of as a special case where time is uniform.  \n\nThinking a little more it might be a better solution to create a weighted moving average where you can supply the alpha from another column, that way we can generalise the weighted moving average approach to any form. My time decay alpha could be an example but indeed it could realistically be anything.\n\nFunctionally I was originally asking about this which is what I do in real time using fast on-line algorithm implementation in C++ but in python this would be equivalent:\n\ndef ema( x, time_now, time_previous, time_scale):\n     time_decay = ((time_now - time_previous)/time_scale)\n     value = value +  time_decay \\* (x - ema)\n     return value;\n\nThe reason I am posting here is I noticed the pandas.ewma function is very quick/optimised (vectorised or cythonised possibly) so was hoping the same could be done.\n"
