    "body": "> This seems like a good idea.\n\nOk, great!\n\n> Should we leave deprecated methods/classes around longer? (i.e., changes to save/load/io.parsers, etc.)\n\nGood question. The bad news: Figuring out what works and and what doesn't is tedious and time-consuming. Often, for example,  I needed to convince people that pandas is suitable backend for production code, simply because things just did not work the way expected across platforms / versions.\nThe good news is: mastering the task I outlined is quite doable, as far as I can tell from my use cases.\n\nBefore we write polished docs just a few blockers / solutions / the most pertinent points\n1. parsing lines without unique index -- see #385 -- use list comprehension + enumerate like:\n\n``` Python\n\n\ndef check_pandas_version(min_version):\n    \"\"\" Check minimum Pandas version required\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    min_version : str\n        The version string. Anything that matches\n        ``'(\\\\d+ | [a-z]+ | \\\\.)'``\n    \"\"\"\n    is_good = False if LooseVersion(pd.__version__) < min_version else True\n    return is_good\n\n\ndef check_line_index(lines):\n    \"\"\"Check whether lines are safe for parsing\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    lines : list of str\n        A list of strings as returned from a file object\n    Returns\n    -------\n    lines : list of str\n        The edited list of strings in case the Pandas version\n        is not recent enough.\n\n    \"\"\"\n    if check_pandas_version('0.8'):\n        return lines\n    else:   # 92mu -- fastest, please don't change\n        return [str(x) + ' ' + y for x, y in enumerate(lines)]\n\n```\n\nTook me quite some time to figure what's wrong. In one application this even lead me to dropping support for older pandas versions. But this is not good. In science update cycles are slower ...\n1. in-place-operations. If you want to be on the safe side, never try to use in-place arguments but overwrite  identifiers, e.g. sort, reset_index,  etc.\n2. iloc, ix, loc, etc. ... if you can make it with ix it's good. Too often I found myself accessing the underlying arrays + casting, doing nan masking manually ....\n3. jumping between pandas versions for testing ...\n\nI know this may sound slightly accusing, but my goal is to help people using pandas for production code + convince others this is a good idea (which I think is the case).\n"

    "body": "@dengemann you bring up some good points, but the very fact that `ix` had some issues led to _extensive_ discussions and introduction of `loc/iloc` to make things easier. Even now, `ix` has issues. Here's one example. In 0.13 all of the indexers change to be sane when working on a `floating` point index.. Useful for some people.\n\nAt the same time as we introduce new features, and squash bugs, I personally (and I know all of the other core dev people) go to **great** lengths to provide backward compat and notice of changes in the API.\n\nHere's another example, @jtratner and I worked extensively making sure that prior version pickles will work in 0.13, even though `Series` is not longer an `ndarray` sub-class.\n\nAnother example, @cpcloud harasses the numexpr/PyTables people about a bug in their newly put out version (2.2.1 of numexpr) that completely broke PyTables 2.4! (which they acceded and are now issuing a new version).\n"

I tnink you all have done an awesome job with this, that's beyond question. But the task is highly non-trivial too and naturally issues remain. My point was rather to start a discussion on how to add some documentstion for long term support use cases and share a few experiences. I'm happy to make a DOC PR once all points are settled. I'd especially like to generate some more concrete reports + recommendations on dealing with ix, an issuw which I did not fully grasp at this point. There will be incoming  news from my side since I'm currently developing a new project for which I chose pandas as backend.\n"

    "body": "re Debian \"taking it faster\":  I guess there is a bit of misunderstanding.  Let me describe the life cycle of pandas in Debian:\n- just few  days (or right on the day) after pandas new release I upload it to Debian unstable (or experimental if Debian in freeze or unstable lacking some core dependency, which iirc didn't happen before).  I think uploading even \"faster\" than that is not really needed ;)\n- then at least 10 days after upload to unstable, if pandas builds fine across all architectures, and there are no critical bugs reported -- it migrates to testing.   ATM I would still need to address issues on armel and s390x: https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=pandas to make it migrate to testing\n- version in testing becomes a candidate for NEXT Debian stable and a candidate for a backports repository for CURRENT Debian stable.\n- when stable Debian releases -- version of pandas there is THE version which will be in Debian stable and only security and critical functionality patches would be allowed.  There is no way to push a new release of pandas into Debian stable.\n\nBut also, besides official Debian -- as  soon as I upload to Debian unstable, I upload backport builds of pandas for EVERY compatible Debian and Ubuntu release to NeuroDebian: see http://neuro.debian.net/pkgs/python-pandas.html .  So technically speaking -- fresh pandas release is nearly always available only few days after for every recent Debian and Ubuntu release, while official 'stable' releases of those distributions come with the 'matured' versions.\n\nTo help with migration of pandas from unstable to testing, which is as currently, usually stalled by problems with building/testing on various less common architectures, I have setup a buildbot on my sparc box for pandas: http://nipy.bic.berkeley.edu/waterfall?category=pandas .  As you might see it still needs some attention and I believe there are few outstanding issues here in the tracker to address failing tests on sparc.\n"
