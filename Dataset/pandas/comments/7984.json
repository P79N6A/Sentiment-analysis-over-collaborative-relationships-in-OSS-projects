    "body": "So, I believe pandas already provides `df.index.is_unique`, which could be used to automatically set UNIQUE for indices.  Perhaps a kwarg to suppress such behavior would be more helpful.\n\nOr perhaps there should be a more powerful mechanism (with a sensical set of defaults) to specify in a unified manner which indices to create, whether they should be unique, and if so whether they should be PRIMARY KEYs.  Perhaps an argument that can specify the set of constraints/indices/primary keys/foreign keys to pass onto the SQLAlchemy `Table()` constructor?  (we could also have an argument with a dict that, for diff columns, specifies the kwargs to pass onto the SQLAlchemy `Column()` constructor; this could generalize what we do with `dtypes` now)  \n\n@jorisvandenbossche Thoughts?\n"

I thought a logical default functionality would be translate the DataFrame's [index](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.set_index.html) to primary key of the DB table.    So to_sql would always create tables with a primary_key defined by the `index` of the DataFrame.  This way, the `to_sql` could just pass the DB error back to the client on attempting to insert duplicate primary_keys.\n\nCurrently the `to_sql` method always creates tables without primary keys which could be improved upon for sure.\n"

    "body": "So my original thoughts on this issue was that SQL Alchemy has something like this built in - where you can basically say I want this arbitrary column going from 0 - N in sequence as my primary key for the table. \n\n```\nproject_id = db.Column(\n    db.Integer, db.Sequence('project_id'), primary_key=True\n)\n```\n\nPandas achieves something pretty similar by just resetting the index - the result is a new index 0-N:\n\n```\ntable = old_table.reset_index()\n```\n\nSo my thinking is because we'd be creating a new \"index\"-like object for the primary key, we could have a kwarg to turn this functionality on (resetting the index as a default seems un-intuitive to me) so that you could tell pandas, I want just a vanilla 0 - N sequence as a primary key. \n\nSo basically what @jefferythewind suggested but with the added requirement that before using the index for the primary key you reset the index or construct a new sequential index internally. \n\nSo maybe something like:  primary_key='string' as a kwarg on the to_sql function where string can be:\n\n`column_name` - select a column to become the primary key, throws an error if is_unique is not true\n`sequential` - generate a new sequential primary key\n`None` - current functionality of no primary key\n\nAs I write this I realize `sequential` could match a column name in some crazy scenario so someone more clever than me might have to come up with the arg usage, but what do you guys think of the general functionality there?\n"
