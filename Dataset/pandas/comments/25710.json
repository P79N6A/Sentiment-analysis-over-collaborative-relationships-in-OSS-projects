    "body": "Personally, I am not really sure we need them (if downstream projects that need it are fine with using the private ones, we can guarantee there stability).\r\n\r\nFrom a user perspective, I think the idea was to have it as a drop in replacement for int index. And you also quickly loose the presence of the RangeIndex, eg by doing a filtering operation, and then at once those attributes don't exist anymore.\r\n\r\nBut not feeling strongly about it (it's maybe just I would rather see dataframes with an optional index :))"

Wouldn't be offended if the PR gets closed."
