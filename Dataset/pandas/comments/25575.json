Don't think I've seen a single working example showing how snap is intended to be used. Does anyone know what it's supposed to do beyond the one sentence description in the docstring?"

It seems to work when the frequencies are things like `W-MON`. Which means it just works on \"Anchored Offsets\"?\r\n\r\nI came across `snap` when I was looking for a `round`/`floor` type method that can handle time changes. I still don't know if `snap` would work, but I know that it doesn't seem to do what I expect based on the little documentation I can find."
