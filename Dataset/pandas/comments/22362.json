    "body": "@WillAyd, it could be intended, but it is confusing indeed. \r\nThe problem comes when intervals are not unitary: 2 months, 3 quarters, etc. If the interval is not unitary, groups are created based on the first date of the dataset:\r\n\r\nGrouping by \"2Q\":\r\n```\r\n2017-04-01 00:00:00    <=== this is because the first datetime index is in  May, 2017\r\n2017-10-01 00:00:00\r\n```\r\nThis behaviour is dangerous because it changes according to the dataset. \r\nTry to imagine financial usage. You have a dataset starting from January 1st and ending December 31st. Grouping looks OK, but just by chance because the first date is in January.\r\n\r\nAs soon as your first date is in May the *2Q* grouping won't start anymore on January, 1st. \r\n\r\nIt is what happened to me: I was using *\"2Q\"* as a synonym for semester, and just changing the demo dataset groups went avoc...\r\n\r\nAdding a further interval such as Z for semester would allow to use it as unitary and avoid this behaviour.

    "body": "I think something like this would be useful.  @Nemecsek does the use case depend on \"semester\" corresponding to e.g. Sep-Dec/Jan-May, or would it be sufficient to have something like `Half` that corresponds to Jan-Jun/July-Dec?  (the latter would be easier to implement)\r\n\r\nAside from that, the design question that comes to mind is whether we should modify Quarter offsets to be customizable, or implement new Half/Semester/Season offset classes.\r\n\r\nPRs welcome.  You'll want to look at pandas.tseries.offsets."
