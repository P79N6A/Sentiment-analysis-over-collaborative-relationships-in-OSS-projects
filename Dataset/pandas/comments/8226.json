Or do you want to allow it as arithmethic operation? (as you want to do for the datetime and timedelta index?)\n- to wrap up: compared to python's built-in set, the only difference after this change would be that `-` does not work as it does with sets? (as `+` does not work as union for sets as it did for index) \n- to make it even more consistent, we could also deprecate `&` and alike, as these also do something different when applied on a series (and then only leave the method versions)\n- maybe something not that related: is there some support for renaming `diff` to `difference`? (or at least start with having that alias and using that in the docs). That `Series.diff` and `Index.diff` do something _completely_ different, that's something I have found very confusing in the past.\n"

    "body": "- now `+` and `-` for an Index and a scalar are add and subtract. This will now be consistent for indexes for which this makes sense (eg. `DatetimeIndex + TimedeltaIndex` and `DatetimeIndex - DatetimeIndex` but not `DatetimeIndex + DatetimeIndex`). Numeric like indexes can easily support this (it is disabled ATM, but just need tests and trivial to implement), for example `Int64Index + Float64Index`. These make everything more `Series` like and natural\n- will change to a warning - easy enough\n- difference from python set: well sets support both union (`+`) and difference (`-`) so Indexes will only by set-like for the boolean operators (`&,|,^`). I don't think this should change (you are right can reavaluate in the future)\n- I am ok with `diff` -> `difference`. Will make that change as well (and warn on the original).\n"

And it seems that in pandas bitwise ops only apply to integer and boolean arrays which are not as common as container indices.\n\nI wonder if anyone considered another option to solve this inconsistency in exactly the opposite way, given that Index is already separated from ndarray, so that operations on Index always have set semantics and if one is going for element-wise arithmetics they should use `idx.values`.\n"

    "body": "Here's a related API consistency issue -- what should the type of the object returned from comparisons and arithmetic operations with an index be?\n\n`index == 0` seems to return a boolean ndarray, whereas `index + index` (in this proposal) will return a new index.\n\nI doubt the index functionality is actually desired or necessary most of the time, and if it is necessary, a ndarray could be coerced to an index anyways. What about making `idx1 - idx2` equivalent to `idx1.values - idx2.values`? The advantage here would be consistency (especially considering comparison operators), and also avoiding the minimal overhead of creating a new index when it's not actually needed.\n\nOn the other hand, there would indeed be some small type detection penalty when casting to an index (as @immerrr points out), and from a practical perspective, TimedeltaIndex and DatetimeIndex are much more functional that `np.datetime64` and `np.timedelta64` ndarrays, so perhaps we are doing our users a favor by never returning those objects.\n\nThoughts?\n"

    "body": "Personally I am -1 on returning an array from arithmetic operations on the Index, then you can better use `idx.values` which is much more explicit. The inconsistency is not that bad here I think. For comparison operations, this leads to an array of bools as you don't have a boolean index type. For arithmetic operations this does not hold. \nSo I would vote for or allow arithmetic on Indexes that return Index, or not allow it (or leave it as set operation)\n"
