    "body": "I want to provide a pull request for this but need an info: I find swaplevel defined in \n\n```\nframe.py, generic.py, index.py and series.py\n```\n\nDo you generate frame,index and series from generic and therefore I only have to update the docstring in there? Or should I fix it in all 4 files. My current suggestion is:\n\n```\n    \"\"\"\n    Swap levels i and j in a MultiIndex on a particular axis\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    i, j : int, string (can be mixed)\n        Level of index to be swapped. Can pass level name as string.\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    swapped : type of caller (new object)\n    \"\"\"\n```\n"
