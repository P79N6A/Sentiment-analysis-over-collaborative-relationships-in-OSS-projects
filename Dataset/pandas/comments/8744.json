    "body": "I think #5694 might be fixed.  I don't get any NaNs like I used to and there was a commit to add timezones so the offsets work properly which fixed it.  Nevertheless, we can start adding some tests for that.  I did take a look at both #5172 and #5694 and have some comments in both.  I remember reaching a place where I didn't know where to proceed, but I can take another crack at it.  I think for starters we can move all these examples to the original.  Clearly they all are related to resample and probably just different incarnations of the same thing at first glance...if we find they are substantially different we can open separate issues at that point.  @ischwabacher, what do you think?\n"
