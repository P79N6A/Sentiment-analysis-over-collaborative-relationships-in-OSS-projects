    "body": "Interesting.  I'm not totally clear on what you're trying to do above - why are you special casing row 0 (instead of just doing something with row 0 first and then changing the line to: `for i in range(1, row):` instead?  It's also unclear why you're using k and j in a for loop, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nBased on a quick read of gspread, the easiest thing to do would be something like:\n\n```\nvalues = wks.get_all_values()\nheader, rows = values[0], values[1:]\ndf = DataFrame(rows, columns=header)\n```\n\nThat said, the above is particularly inefficient because it first stores all of the cells in `Cell` objects, creates a defaultdict, stores everything, then uses a double list comprehension to get all the data. \n\n1 big question: Why would you use gspread over the Google Data API? Are their particular advantages?\n"

    "body": "Strong +1 on this! Couple of things:\n1. It would be nice to support OAuth authentication, if possible, so that users don't have to pass plain text passwords around. This also enables users to not have to log in every time they want to use this. I would not want to store my password in a script so that I could reuse this as part of some larger code base. If this is already supported, then maybe some documentation about it is in order. If I missed that documentation, my apologies.\n2. You can probably use `pandas.io.parsers.TextReader` to parse the text. You just have to get the values into a list of lists of strings.\n"

I asked about it on StackOverflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19071622/automatically-rename-columns-to-ensure-they-are-unique and I get this piece of code \n\n```\ndf_columns = ['a', 'b', 'a', 'a_2', 'a_2', 'a', 'a_2', 'a_2_2']\n\ndef uniquify(df_columns):\n    seen = set()\n\n    for item in df_columns:\n        fudge = 1\n        newitem = item\n\n        while newitem in seen:\n            fudge += 1\n            newitem = \"{}_{}\".format(item, fudge)\n\n        yield newitem\n       seen.add(newitem)\n\nlist(uniquify(df_columns))\n#>>> ['a', 'b', 'a_2', 'a_2_2', 'a_2_3', 'a_3', 'a_2_4', 'a_2_2_2']\n```\n\nBut Pandas probably ever provide a way to \"uniquify\" columns name (I should have a look at `read_excel` code to understand that part of Pandas)\n"
