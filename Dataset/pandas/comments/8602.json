I've also diffed the pandas 0.14.1 and 0.15 branch, to see what changes may interfere with py2app. But i wasn't lucky yet. i'm really starting to think that this issue related to the way pandas is build, which is more complex in combination with the build tools provided by py2app.\n\n**Update:** I've traced down this issue to commit 84404afc6eec53e3d31ee9298cecf2b3c2de1d8c. before that commit everything worked fine. obviously this was the time tslib.pyx started to `import pandas.algos as algos`. every other change looks harmless.\n"
