    "body": "+1 on the general idea of standardizing.\r\n\r\nI don't have any preferences on the style of the imports, beyond separating\r\n\r\n* stdlib\r\n* 3rd party\r\n* pandas\r\n\r\ninto three sections.\r\n\r\nIn the past we've always used absolute imports. I find relative imports slightly nicer to work with. If we want to change to relative, now is the time to do it.\r\n\r\nOn the process, I think the first step (after agreeing on a config) is to add the isort check to our CI config. We'll need to set the `skip` setting. At the start this will be a long list of files, but over the course of several PRs we can work that down and maybe eventually eliminate it entirely (there may be some files we don't care about)."
