    "body": "My mistake, i introduced the np.iterable(cols) check to close another ticket, but did not think about the scenario where cols can be a single column label that is iterable. Like a _string_, which is covered now by @wesm his fix, and also _tuple_ (which is still a problem), others? Maybe better to check if cols is in self.columns and if not, go from there to iterate or not. \n"
