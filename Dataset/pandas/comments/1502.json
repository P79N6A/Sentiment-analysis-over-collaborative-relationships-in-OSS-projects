    "body": "Unfortunately have to table any improvements here until a later release can make deeper infrastructural changes to DataFrame's internals. Each time you insert a column, it has to modify the column index, and unfortunately this is not a cheap operation (takes about 100 microseconds when you already have 10000 columns). I don't recommend writing a lot of code like this that inserts tons of columns-- instead populate a dict then turn that into a DataFrame. \n"
