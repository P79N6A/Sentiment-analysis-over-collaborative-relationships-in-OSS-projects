    "body": "I have this here:\nhttp://nbviewer.ipython.org/4982660/\n\nIn order to support financial data I send mpl an ordinal index, essential np.arange(len(df.index)) and draw the ticks with a Locator/Formatter. Doing this with DatetimeIndex actually speeds up plotting https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/1579 and gets rid of weekend gaps. However, a side effect of this is that you have to keep the previous data around for future plots on the same axes. For that I have a Figure class that handles translating any future plots into an ordinal index. I chose to keep all plotted data around for plot specific fillnas, but that's probably unnecessary. \n\nI'd like to merge this stuff in but I'm not sure how compatible it is. trtools.charting is fairly heavy handed in assuming you're not touching matplotlib directly. Mixing ordinal and datetime index plots on the same axes wouldn't work. \n\nThe module itself is self-contained outside of a small column_grep utility, so it can be made to be cleanly import-able as an add-on. \n"

    "body": "@woodb Actually, a smaller first pass could be done with http://nbviewer.ipython.org/5864433. That uses the `matplotlib` datetime handling. \n\n`ts-charting` converts the `DatetimeIndex` to ints and translates the labels back with a custom Formatter. I'm pretty sure this could be made `pandas` compatible by always checking the current `ax` for our `TimestampFormatter` and reindexing to the current x-axis. I suppose the `Figure` and `Grapher` classes would need their methods refactored into flat functions or hidden away onto the Formatter.\n\nConverting to an int-index is better but it means that every plot to that `ax` will need the translation. It's convenient to call `fig.hl_span(\"2012-01-02\", \"2012-01-05\")`, but the base `matplotlib` method would not work `ax.axvspan(\"2012-01-02\", \"2012-01-05\")` unless I monkey patched it.  \n\nActually, thinking about it more. I dunno if that's acceptable for inclusion into `pandas`. Part of the reason for the `Figure` abstraction is to create a namespace where all methods are aware of the _Datetime_ **->** _int_ translation. hm.\n\nGo Gators??!\n"
