The HTML representation of a Series should look different from a DataFrame.\r\n\r\nIn that case, maybe a different approach would be to change the style of the table rather than the content.

    "body": "@TomAugspurger and @phobson and I spoke this afternoon.  We are leaning toward a quick implementation by calling `DataFrame._repr_html_` and then making changes to the HTML.  Not using lxml, though; that definitely seems like overkill.  But with just a few lines of code we can add a caption with the name of the Series and the dtype, and it should be pretty robust.\r\n\r\n@jreback, you are right that a real implementation would be better, but I think this is a case where a good enough solution is very easy, and the best solution is substantially harder."
