    "body": "hold on - this is a not-insignificant change here - doesn't this mean you lose indexing on isnull() and notnull()?   I think it's fine to have pd.isnull() return unboxed, but NDFrame.isnull() and NDFrame.notnull() should definitely box by default. Maybe it could just short-circuit the constructor instead?  The boxing behavior is available on 0.10 and later, so it's not reasonable to change without discussing. You lose a _lot_ of expressiveness this way. Maybe you could add a keyword argument \"box=True\" to it so that internals can call and not box result.\n"

    "body": "@jtratner I preserved the orginal behavior (I had actually changed this in internal refactoring for 0.13). the `isnull` called directly don't need to actually create a Series (I was going to add a `box` argument, but its not necessary.\n\nThis doesn't affect > 1dim objects anyhow didn't even have `df.isnull()`; `pd.isnull(df)` returns the correct (boxed version)\nHere's 0.12\n\n```\nIn [1]: s = Series([1,np.nan])\n\nIn [2]: df = DataFrame(dict(A = s))\n\nIn [3]: s.isnull()\nOut[3]: \n0    False\n1     True\ndtype: bool\n\nIn [4]: df.isnull()\nAttributeError\n\nIn [5]: pd.isnull(s)\nOut[5]: \n0    False\n1     True\ndtype: bool\n\nIn [6]: pd.isnull(df)\nOut[6]: \n       A\n0  False\n1   True\n```\n\nThe difference is:\na Series will not box (this _happens_ to work in 0.12)\n\n```\nIn [5]: pd.isnull(s)\nOut[5]: array([False,  True], dtype=bool)\n```\n\nI could make this work (but will need a `box` keyword that is `True` by default by set `False` by almost\nevery routine that used this internally. Which I think is a needless complication.\n\nThe API is actually much cleaner as `isnull/notnull` exist on all objects.\n\nand boolean indexing will work exactly the same. I don't actually think this is an API change at all.\n"
