    "body": "Hmm yea it looks like each of the parsers evaluate the callable at different points in time. Unfortunately for the reader being used here, it doesn't look like it ever executes that.\r\n\r\nI suppose a simple fix here would be to evaluate the callable in the FixedWidthReader class. It could probably be done in `get_rows` as there is already some modification of the object being done there (linked below for ref) - want to submit a PR (with tests) for this?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/6d610a4d9393c0d0335267dc3252ccabb9e51e43/pandas/io/parsers.py#L3378"
