    "body": "This isn't a bug, `set_index()` should not check whether the list-like you've passed is actually a column of the DataFrame or not.\n\ne.g. this would be an ambiguous case for it\n\n``` python\na = df.a.copy()\na.iloc[0] = 5\ndf.set_index(a)\n```\n\nAs you can see in the code, if you pass a Series to `set_index()`, it gets used as the index just like a list, except that the index will be named according to its `name` property.\n"
