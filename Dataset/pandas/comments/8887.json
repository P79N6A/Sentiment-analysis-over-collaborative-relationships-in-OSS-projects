    "body": "see here: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/gotchas.html#minimum-and-maximum-timestamps\n\nthese are out of range of the high performance datetime impl, so these revert to object dtypes. \n\nAn alternative is to use Periods. (though their is an open issue with storing these in HDF5. Its not difficult, just needs a bit of work, see [here](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/7796)\n\nSo this should raise ATM in HDF5. These cannot be serialized in table format at all (Object block is restricted to actual strings). I think fixed format might work.\n\nThat said if you would like to work on the period repr would be great5.\n"
