If you just meant that a lot of data had to be copied underneath the hood, then I understand completely. \n\nStill, I'd guess it's quite different from append in that it manages to add a row in-place. (I didn't even know it's possible...)\n\n```\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'a':[1]})\ndf1 = df\ndf1.loc[10] = 100\nassert df is df1\nassert len(df) == 2\n```\n\nHonestly, given the performance impact, I'm truly at a loss as to why \"Setting with Enlargement\" was added to the DataFrame API.\n"
