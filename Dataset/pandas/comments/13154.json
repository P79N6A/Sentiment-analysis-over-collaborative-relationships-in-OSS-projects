    "body": "This was regarded as a bug (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/11082), and was fixed for 0.18.1 (PR #12846). \n\nSo it is mentioned in the whatsnew docs (\"Bug in `concat` doesn't handle empty `Series` properly\"), but of course difficult to find in such a long list, and it was also not put in the API changes section (it is always a bit subjective whether something is clearly a bug fix or also worth mentioning as an API change, as people can rely on the buggy behaviour. You could argue that in this case a API change mention would be worth it).\n"
