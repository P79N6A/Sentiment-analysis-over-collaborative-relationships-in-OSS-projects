    "body": "@jreback \n\nAt work, I receive daily many third party csv files (e.g. new orders etc) which I need to parse, add some derived columns, and then load into database. Occasionally, some of the files may be empty and just having the column names. For example\n\n```\nDate,ProductID,Quantity,UnitCost\n01282013,1,10,3\n01282013,2,5,6\n```\n\nTo load into database, I simply use\n\n```\nfrom datetime import datetime\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv', dtype={'Date': 'object'})\ndf.Date = df.Date.map(lambda s: datetime.strptime(s, '%m%d%Y'))\ndf['TotalCost'] = df.Quantity * df.UnitCost\nload_into_database(df)\n```\n\nBut on some days when there are no orders i.e. the input file is just\n\n```\nDate,ProductID,Quantity,UnitCost\n```\n\nThe program would break when adding new columns to empty dataframe. Of course, I could always\ncheck `if len(df) > 0` before adding new columns. But somehow, I would still need to add the `TotalCost` column to the empty dataframe before passing it to the function `load_into_database`.\n\nAnyway, the intended change will not a problem for me. Probably this example is too specific and has easy workaround.\n"
