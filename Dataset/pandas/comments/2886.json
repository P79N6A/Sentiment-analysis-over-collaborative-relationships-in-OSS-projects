    "body": "With the mismatched trailing commas `'a,b,c\\n4,apple,bat,,\\n8,orange,cow,,,'`\nif I call `read_csv(..., error_bad_lines=False)` omitting the `index_col=False`\nthen it will keep processing the data but will drop the bad line.\n\nIf `index_col=False` is added in then it will fail with the error as described in 1 above.\n\nI have a similar issue processing files where the last field is freeform text and the separator is sometimes included.\n\nI have two different workarounds depending on the situation:\n1. if it is just trailing commas then I pre-process the data to remove the commas.\n2. For the case where the final field contains the separator I pre-process the file using: \n\n`perl -pne '$_ = join(\"|\", split(/,/, $_, 4) )' < input.csv > output.csv`\n\nwhere 4 is the max number of fields that I want to have.  This option requires a second delimiter (all valid `,` get changed to `|` and any `,` after the 4th is unchanged).\n\nI hope this workaround helps.\n"
