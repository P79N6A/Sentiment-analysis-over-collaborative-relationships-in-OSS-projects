    "body": "Thanks for the quick response! Agree that would solve this, but from a design perspective I don't think I understand why that would be the right way to handle it.\r\n\r\nWhat's the usecase where you are trying to round a valid time and you would WANT to raise a NonExistentTimeError? Or even deeper, what would that mean? If you're working within valid times, rounding should always be an allowed operation (to another valid time), right?"

    "body": "Well operationally rounding `'2018-03-11 01:59:00-0600'` to the closest 5min would yield `'2018-03-11 02:00:00'` which does not exist hence `NonExistentTimeError` could be a valid output.\r\n\r\nIt is inconvenient that this is the _only_ output though, so giving user the ability to `'raise'`, or replace with `'NaT'` or `'shift'` to 3:00 (which what you want) would be a nice for the user to control instead of pandas dictating what the correct behavior should be.
