And in such a case a cache could be very useful. Sometimes cache can be dangerous because you will get obsolete data but that's the risk.\n\nAbout requests it's a great library I like how it simplifies things but I also understand that adding a dep must be a deliberate decision.\n\nI also wonder if you know others Pandas functions that could take benefits from such a feature.\n"
