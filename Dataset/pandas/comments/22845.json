That said, I don't view transpose as a really \"core\" dataframe operation, since it doesn't work with heterogenous data. A more compelling case is a wide dataframe of homogenous EAs. With (consolidated) 2D EAs that would be relatively fast. But, I think the hope is we can rewrite the BlockManager in Cython so that the non-consolidated case is much closer to the consolidated one."

    "body": "@jbrockmendel what inheritance structure do you have in mind for DatetimeArray / DatetimeIndex?\r\n\r\nI'm struggling a bit with the PeriodArray refactor right now because things are getting mixed up. If we follow the Categorical pattern, we have\r\n\r\n- Categorical(ExtensionArray)\r\n- CategoricalIndex(Index)\r\n\r\nbut it seems like the DatetimeArrayMixin / PeriodArrayMixin has something like\r\n\r\n- PeriodArray(PeriodArrayMixin, ExtensionArray)\r\n- PeriodIndex(PeriodArrayMixin, DatelikeOps, DatetimeIndexOpsMixin, Int64Index):\r\n\r\nIMO, the fact that PeriodIndex / DatetimeIndex shouldn't inherit from PeriodArrayMixin, since PeriodArray, since they'll have different `.values`. For PeriodArray, that's an `ndarray[int]`. For `PeriodIndex` that's a `PeriodArray`.\r\n\r\nHere's my WIP branch: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/compare/master...TomAugspurger:ea-period\r\n\r\nOn that branch, I've removed PeriodArrayMixin, and just subsumed its methods in PeriodArray (which inherits from DatetimelikeArrayMixin).\r\n\r\nOps and indexing aren't working yet."
