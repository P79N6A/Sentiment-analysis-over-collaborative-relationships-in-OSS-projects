Don't need anything else. Just a quick way to browse data will go a long way. The other linked example in the docs from #5013 is pretty close, though it looks like there are problems with setting data, etc. and it needs a bit of layout work. Advanced features don't need to be ready for something like that to be useful though.\n"
