    "body": "+1 for making it look like the Parquet API. Both formats are very similar and could be considered as \"competitors\". They should also roughly match on the `pyarrow` in future (ORC is currently missing Dataset support in the style of `pyarrow.parquet.ParquetDataset` and we're missing a writer API which makes testing hard).\r\n\r\nWe can skip the `engine` argument here though as there is only one implementation at the moment."
