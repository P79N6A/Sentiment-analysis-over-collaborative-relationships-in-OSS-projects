There's also Python's builtin `filter` function.\r\n\r\nAnother option might be merging the functionality of `select` and `filter` under one name, so it supports both list-like and function arguments."

    "body": "I don't have time to handle this at the moment, but I may be interested in doing it when time permits if it hasn't been done already by then.\r\n\r\nFWIW, upon some thought, I still think changing the name of `.filter` to `.select*` would be best. I don't feel strongly about `.select` vs `.select_labels`. I generally prefer shorter names, but the added verbosity here might make things clearer. Calling it `.select` has the benefit that only one name is deprecated, not two.\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure about dropping the current behaviour of `.select` entirely because I have a use case which I'm not sure how to implement without it (and without resorting to things like `.reset_index()` to regain the ability to select by using a function).\r\n\r\nIn particular, I have a `MultiIndex` with 2 levels, each of which has elements of type `str`. In other words, each index value is conceptually a pair of strings. Currently I'm doing something like\r\n\r\n    df.select(lambda x: condition1(x[0]) and condition2(x[1]))\r\n\r\nand similar to select particular rows. How could this be implemented without current `.select` functionality?\r\n\r\n"

For me the alternative like `.loc[:, lambda df: complex_fxn_that_selects_a_few_cols(df.columns)]` is harder to read and to teach as `.select(complex_fxn_that_selects_a_few_cols()`.

For actual selection by column value, people also use numpy operators `np.select(condlist, choicelist, ...)` (for multiple values) and `np.where(cond, [valTrue, valFalse])` for two values. Is that good/bad/another alternative?  Witness the [confusion on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19913659/pandas-conditional-creation-of-a-series-dataframe-column). I think the root of the issue is that pandas `select` verb disagreed with what numpy and SQL `select` do, hence created confusion.\r\n\r\nThere's still a docbug needed on this, but first we need to know what you actually recommend."
