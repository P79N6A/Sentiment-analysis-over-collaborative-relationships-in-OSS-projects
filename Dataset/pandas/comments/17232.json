I found the following discussion (basically all I could found about it):\r\n\r\nhttps://lists.gt.net/python/dev/1129944\r\n> > Does anyone remember the rationale for this behaviour? \r\n\r\n>>I don't recall any better rationale than what I wrote in the docs: \"String \r\nrepresentations of timedelta objects are normalized similarly to their \r\ninternal representation.\"\r\n\r\nI guess it would be better  to have python's default implementation of the string changed (instead of doing it in an ad-hoc fashion for every different project, including pandas), but as this won't be the case, I believe it is a good idea to add to pandas, because the way it is is very non intuitive. \r\nI can't think of a case where anyone would prefer it when dealing with negative timedeltas.\r\n"
