It could be that your `sys.tracebacklimit` is too small for all the error messages to be displayed.\r\n\r\n2) I see you are using `pandas` 0.18.1.  We are in fact now at `0.20.3` - perhaps the discrepancy is due to the fact that you have a very old `pandas` version.  Could you try upgrading and see if that helps?"
