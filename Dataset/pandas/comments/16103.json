I made a lot of embarrassing small mistakes in this pull request that I'll fix and resubmit.\r\n\r\nRegarding the concern about which values the `+` operator should be defined for, why not simply define it for the widest range of values possible. It should be the responsibility of the user to ensure that their operator works correctly. This is consistent with the current implementation of `__neg__`. \r\n\r\nIdeally `np.array` will be fixed and this entire point will be moot.\r\n\r\n"
