Default behavior is as if set to 0 if no names passed, otherwise None. **Explicitly pass header=0 to be able to replace existing names.** The header can be a list of integers that specify row locations for a multi-index on the columns e.g. [0,1,3]. Intervening rows that are not specified will be skipped (e.g. 2 in this example is skipped). Note that this parameter ignores commented lines and empty lines if skip_blank_lines=True, so header=0 denotes the first line of data rather than the first line of the file.\r\n\r\nIn any case is the code behavior correct?\r\nShould read_csv give an error even if I set incorrectly ```header=```?\r\n"

    "body": "OK, I think the confusion/disagreement is due to mixing several issues here:\r\n\r\n**1. Combination of `header` and `names` kwargs (in a simple case)**\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [1]: s = \"\"\"a,b\r\n   ...: 1,2\r\n   ...: 3,4\"\"\"\r\n\r\nIn [2]: pd.read_csv(StringIO(s), names=['A', 'B'])\r\nOut[2]: \r\n   A  B\r\n0  a  b\r\n1  1  2\r\n2  3  4\r\n\r\nIn [3]: pd.read_csv(StringIO(s), names=['A', 'B'], header=0)\r\nOut[3]: \r\n   A  B\r\n0  1  2\r\n1  3  4\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, as stated in the docs, you can pass `header=0` to replace the header in the file. This is what I meant above with: \"I don't see what is wrong with the docs\" and so questioned your \"the doc just seems outright wrong\" statement. @gfyoung Do you agree this behaviour is correct? And as documented? (possibly the wording can be improved)\r\n\r\n**2. Determination of the number of columns**\r\n\r\nand whether this is based on the `header`, `names` of the number of values in the data.\r\n\r\n@gfyoung you said above:\r\n\r\n> It's a little more involved than that. The `header` rows are used as well as the row following the `header` to figure out the expected number of columns. That's why the second example fails and not the first.\r\n\r\nThe main problem here is, I think, that it is not clear what exactly is this \"row following the header\" (first data row). \r\nIn the below example I try to logically think about what this would mean, and what I therefore expect. In the last case, this does not match.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Consider those two files, starting with 1 or two shorter rows\r\ns1 = \"\"\"1,2\r\n1,2,3,4\r\n1,2,3,4\r\n1,2,3,4\"\"\"\r\n\r\ns2 = \"\"\"1,2\r\n1,2\r\n1,2,3,4\r\n1,2,3,4\"\"\"\r\n\r\n## by default, first row is taken as header\r\n# based on first two rows -> 4 colums (but first two set as index because header is shorter)\r\nIn [28]: pd.read_csv(StringIO(s1))\r\nOut[28]: \r\n     1  2\r\n1 2  3  4\r\n  2  3  4\r\n  2  3  4\r\n\r\n# based on first two rows -> 2 columns inferred -> error as further on you get more columns\r\nIn [29]: pd.read_csv(StringIO(s2))\r\n...\r\nParserError: Error tokenizing data. C error: Expected 2 fields in line 3, saw 4\r\n\r\n## passing names -> this is used as header, all rows in file as data rows\r\n# based on header (=names) and first row of file (first data row) -> 4 columns inferred\r\nIn [24]: pd.read_csv(StringIO(s1), names=list('abcd'))\r\nOut[24]: \r\n   a  b    c    d\r\n0  1  2  NaN  NaN\r\n1  1  2  3.0  4.0\r\n2  1  2  3.0  4.0\r\n3  1  2  3.0  4.0\r\n\r\n# based on header (=names) and first row of file (first data row) -> 4 columns inferred\r\nIn [25]: pd.read_csv(StringIO(s2), names=list('abcd'))\r\nOut[25]: \r\n   a  b    c    d\r\n0  1  2  NaN  NaN\r\n1  1  2  NaN  NaN\r\n2  1  2  3.0  4.0\r\n3  1  2  3.0  4.0\r\n\r\n## also passing header=0 -> names overwrite first (header) row of file\r\n# based on header (=names) and second row of file (first data row) -> 4 columns inferred\r\nIn [26]: pd.read_csv(StringIO(s1), names=list('abcd'), header=0)\r\nOut[26]: \r\n   a  b  c  d\r\n0  1  2  3  4\r\n1  1  2  3  4\r\n2  1  2  3  4\r\n\r\n## also passing header=0 -> names overwrite first (header) row of file\r\n# based on header (=names) and second row of file (first data row) -> 4 columns inferred \r\n# -> NOT the case -> in reality only 2 columns inferred\r\nIn [27]: pd.read_csv(StringIO(s2), names=list('abcd'), header=0)\r\n...\r\nParserError: Error tokenizing data. C error: Expected 2 fields in line 3, saw 4\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it seems that `names` is not used to determine the number of columns when `header=0` (but when header=None, `names` is used). Only the actual rows in the file (so based on the header row in the file before it is replaced by `names`, and not based on the header passed through `names`) are used in this case. This seems an inconsistency between `header=None` and `header=0` to me.\r\n\r\nOf course it can be discussed whether the header row or `names` should be used to determine the number of rows in the case of `header=0`, but since you are *replacing the existing header* with `names`, I would expect the `names` to be used.\r\n"
