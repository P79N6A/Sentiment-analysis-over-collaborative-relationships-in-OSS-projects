So I am certainly in favor of mentioning this when creating the branch (as @jreback points out) or when doing the first push. But maybe we can still keep the general working method here?

(before creating a new feature branch)\r\n\r\nI only had basic git skills when I started contributing to pandas, so I just followed the contributing guide, probably too closely, and was using the previously recommended `rebase` procedure of:\r\n```\r\ngit fetch upstream\r\ngit rebase upstream/master\r\n```\r\nDefinitely overkill though, as I never actually make changes on master."
