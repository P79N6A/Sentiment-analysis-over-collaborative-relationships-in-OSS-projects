This issue is not about that.\n\nI have realised that set_levels and get_level_values should not necessarily be symmetrical. What I think is missing from pandas is a get_levels function that would be symmetrical to get_levels (the levels property is not the same as you cannot use labels).\n\nFailing that, I have found that the workaround for this is to replace\n\n```\ndf.index.get_level_values(level)\n```\n\nwith\n\n```\ndf.index.levels[df.index.names.index(level)]\n```\n\nin my code, i.e.\n\n```\nlevel_index = df.index.names.index('A')\ndf.index.set_levels(df.index.levels[level_index].map(lambda x: x * 2), level='A', inplace=True)\n```\n"

I.e. where you would be used to saying `df.columns = ['A', 'B', 'C']` or `df.index = ['A', 'B', 'C']`, you can't say `df.set_columns(['A', 'B', 'C'], level=0)`.\n"

That's probably not a discussion for the issue tracker though.\n"
