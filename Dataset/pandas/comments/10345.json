I absolutely agree that the basic operation of wanting to know the most recent value is a common one, and that `s.dropna().reindex(where, method='ffill')` is unfortunately a lot more verbose than `s.asof(where)`.\n\nThat said, `reindex` has the advantage of working for a `NDFrame` or `DataFrame`, and working with a `MultiIndex`, none of which are supported by `asof`.\n\nThe question becomes if the convenience of the shorter form for the specialized use case is worth the code bloat from multiple implementations of the same thing. I'm not personally convinced that it does, but that's definitely something worth discussing.\n"

    "body": "Note: I never used asof myself, so difficult to assess. \nBut, if `asof` is used and is useful, I think we should reconsider the deprecation. I agree that the equivalent of `s.dropna().reindex(where, method='ffill')` is not that straightforward, and easy to come up with.\n\nWe either deprecate it, or we keep it and see this as an opportunitiy to:\n- reimplement it using the existing and better tested reindexing machinery\n- in this way, make the function more general (not restricted to timeseries)\n- in the docstring, make it clear that this is a shortcut for a reindexing operation, and if you want more options (other filling etc) or use it for a dataframe you should use that. In this way, the function can also be somewhat educational to explain what reindexing does\n- also explain this in the tutorial docs\n\nAnd maybe it would be useful to have some kind of `skipna` kwarg in `reindex`?\n"
