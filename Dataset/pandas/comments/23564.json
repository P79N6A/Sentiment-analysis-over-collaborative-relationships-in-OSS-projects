    "body": "I would argue against automatic promotion to 117 since this is adding some magic -- the default command has `version=114` which would then be ignored based on data.  Better to be explicit (don't want to be like R full of magic and pixie dust having a user wondering why they got a 117 format file and not understanding it was because they have a long string that they might not care aboue).  \r\n\r\nI think a more helpful error would be good, one that mentions that setting verions=117 allows for arbitrary length strings. The error message instructing users to consider 117 should also inform them of the limitations -- specifically that files exported in format 117 can only be ready by Stata 13 or newer.

I use pandas and Stata a lot, so I was surprised to see it.\r\n\r\n> I always find automagic choices to be too magic. I would prefer to move to 117 by default with a standard deprecation cycle than to have data-dependent format choices.\r\n> \r\n> > Stata 13 was released 5.5 years ago, so I think it's a safe wager that the vast majority of users have 13, 14, or 15.\r\n> \r\n> I think you might be surprised how many institutions are not current on Stata and only upgrade idiosyncratically.\r\n\r\nIn my crowd of colleagues (i.e. academics who aren't the fastest upgraders), one of these rules would work (assuming Stata stays on a roughly two-year cycle):\r\n\r\n1. When new Stata version `n` is released, begin the deprecation process to change the default to the format supporting Stata `n-2`.\r\n2. Same as 1 but substituting `n-3`.\r\n\r\nFor an initial change, maybe the 0.25.0 to 1.0 cycle would be a good time to change it. If your code is (possibly) going to break anyway, why not add one more easy fix?\r\n\r\n\r\n> I would argue against automatic promotion to 117 since this is adding some magic -- the default command has `version=114` which would then be ignored based on data. Better to be explicit (don't want to be like R full of magic and pixie dust having a user wondering why they got a 117 format file and not understanding it was because they have a long string that they might not care aboue).\r\n> \r\n> I think a more helpful error would be good, one that mentions that setting verions=117 allows for arbitrary length strings. The error message instructing users to consider 117 should also inform them of the limitations -- specifically that files exported in format 117 can only be ready by Stata 13 or newer. (FWIW 114 goes back to Stata 10\r\n\r\nI made a PR for improving the error message: #23629.\r\n"
