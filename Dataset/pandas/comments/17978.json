    "body": "Hi all - I'm a maintainer of Hypothesis and happy user of Pandas, so hopefully I can help with this :smile: \r\n\r\n* Hypothesis is *not* deterministic by default - though you can derandomize it, we don't recommend this.\r\n* For obvious reasons though, we put a *lot* of effort into ensuring that [test failures are always reproducible](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reproducing.html).  Short version: we try to print a call you can copy-paste to get the error plus the seed value if necessary.  If it looks like that might fail, we have a decorator to force everything to the right internal state and print that code with the base64 data it needs to reproduce everything.\r\n* Failing examples are also persisted to disk, so the test will fail immediately if you rerun the test suite before fixing the bug no matter how unlikely it was to find.\r\n* Test runtime is a reasonable concern; there's not usually much overhead but running a test tens or hundreds of times is inherently slower than running it once!  The usual solution is some combination of \"don't use it for everything\", \"turn down the `max_examples` setting in CI\", and \"just deal with it\".  \r\n* All hypothesis tests automatically apply a pytest marker to themselves too, so you can include or exclude them with `-m hypothesis` or `-m \"not hypothesis\"`.  So it would be easy to only run them with the slow tests, for example.\r\n\r\nAnd my question to Pandas maintainers: what's the best way to add this as a dependency?  Hypothesis can be installed from PyPI or from conda-forge, so it's down to whatever would work best in your CI."

    "body": "I have three high-level concerns about #20590:\r\n\r\n1. Configuration can be centralised in `conftest.py`, which makes it easier to edit or just override with a command-line argument than using explicit decorators everywhere.\r\n\r\n2. I would ditch the `util/_hypothesis.py` module, and just the Hypothesis api directly.  We've put a lot of thought into making it clear, flexible, and orthogonal - and it has much better performance and error reporting than anything I know of downstream.  If there's anything Pandas-specific that would be really helpful, we would be happy to add it to `hypothesis.extra.pandas` upstream so everyone can use it!\r\n\r\n3. Pandas would probably get much more value out of Hypothesis by using it for integration-style tests, i.e. for more complex invariants where there are more interacting parts.  In Hypothesis' own test suite we still use traditional unit tests (often with `pytest.mark.parametrize`) to check input validation, because it's just not worth the runtime.\r\n   #18761 has some interesting stuff for that, though it too could be much simpler with more idiomatic use of Hypothesis!\r\n\r\nSo rather than tread on toes by suggesting detailed edits to those PRs, I might open a *third* one this weekend incorporating some of both and some of my own notes."
