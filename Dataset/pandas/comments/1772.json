    "body": "I think that any non-\"Tick\" offsets, (e.g. AS-DEC as you're doing there) should zero-out the start and end times. This fixes your test case-- all the other tests pass and I haven't thought through the ways this could cause other bugs (hopefully None). Your #1 point is one way to look at it-- when I thought about the date range API initially, I felt that the start and end times should be strict, with no dates generated outside them (roll forward start / roll back end). Requiring that the range include both endpoints is the other way (roll back start, roll forward end). Would be a difficult to change now...\n"
