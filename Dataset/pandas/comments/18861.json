Nowhere is that mention in the docs for `read_sql` (unless that's what \"text object\" means?).   I've been only using `read_sql` for executing SQL queries.\r\n\r\n>  as only when reading a full table we can use the sql table metadata information to do type inference.\r\n\r\nHmmm...how would reading all remaining `n - 1` columns be able to get you type information about the first the column?
