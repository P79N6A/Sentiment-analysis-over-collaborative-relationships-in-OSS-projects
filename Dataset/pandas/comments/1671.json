    "body": "Hi,\n\nI had some code that was relaying on the Series constructor the way it was before this bugfix. I was able to adapt it to the new version very easily, but I just wonder if this is the intended behavior now:\n\n```\nIn [2]: Series(Series([\"a\"]), index=[2])\nOut[2]: 2    NaN\n```\n\nwhen before you could do:\n\n```\nIn [2]: Series(Series([\"a\"]), index=[2])\nOut[2]: 2    a\n```\n\nOf course, you can still get the same result as before just by using the `.values` property:\n\n```\nIn [3]: Series(Series([\"a\"]).values, index=[2])\nOut[3]: 2    a\n\n```\n\nso, again, I'm just wondering if this is the intended behavior or maybe an unforeseen side-effect.\n\nThanks and regards.\nManu.\n"

    "body": "Yes. I never intended for this behavior:\n\n```\nIn [2]: Series(Series([\"a\"]), index=[2])\nOut[2]: 2    a\n```\n\nIt's not consistent with how Series handles other data types, like dicts. It's been brought up to me by others, but I think unfortunately a lot of people have written code relying on the \"bug\" here.\n"
