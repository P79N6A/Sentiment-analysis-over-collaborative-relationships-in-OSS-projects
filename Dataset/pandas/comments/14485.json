    "body": "using lists inside of cells is an anti-pattern. \n\nThe reason this is hard to do is that lists are being returned; these are normally sampled then coerced based on the returning dtypes. Since this doesn't reduce that's a hard thing to do. It is possible, but cannot always be guessed.\n\nif you really really want to work with this type of structure, you can do:\n\n```\nIn [6]: x.groupby(['a','b']).apply(lambda x: x.sum())\nOut[6]: \n     a   b             c\na b                     \n1 a  2  aa  [1, 2, 3, 4]\n2 a  2   a        [5, 6]\n  b  2   b        [7, 8]\n```\n\nThis is pretty non-performant though (as is keeping lists inside cells).\n\nSo if you want to see if you can this to work in the general case w/o changing any existing behavior, then would accept a PR.\n\nClosing as this is not a bug, more like an unsupported type.\n"
