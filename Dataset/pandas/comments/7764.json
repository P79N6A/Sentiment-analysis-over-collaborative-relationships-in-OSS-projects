Otherwise I **strongly** prefer the behavior of letting the code continue with NaNs, after all, if you are using min_periods, you expect to get at least some NaNs. And I'm not at my work machine now, but I am 99% sure I can avoid this error by adding dummy NaNs to the beginning and removing them afterwards, which doesn't make any sense to me. But please let me know if there is some obvious downside to letting the code continue with NaNs?\n"

    "body": "I think the observed 14.1 behavior of `rolling_corr/cov` -- reducing `window` to the actual data length, and so potentially triggering the `min_periods > window` error, (a) has been there since before 14.1, and (b) is trivial to fix by simply not `min`ing the `window`. I don't really know what the purpose of the `min` is/was, but I decided to leave it there when I did https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/7604).\n\nActually, only difference I can see is that when `min_periods=None`, since it defaults to `window`, reducing a `window` greater than the data length to the actual data length causes values to be calculated for the final index, whereas not doing so would lead to all NaNs. As I mentioned, I don't like the default setting of `min_periods` to `window`, but given that that's what's being done, I think it would be most consistent to not reduce `window`.\n\nAm happy to submit a PR to eliminate `adj_window = min(window, len(X), len(Y))` if you agree. \n"
