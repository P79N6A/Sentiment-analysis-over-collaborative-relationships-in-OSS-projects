    "body": "@WillAyd Any thoughts on the suggestion to move timedelta_struct and associated conversion funcs out of the src/ directory and into cython?  I'll volunteer to actually do the implementation, but want to get your blessing first.\r\n\r\nBackground: src/datetime/ is a big dependency, much of which is only used for src/ujson.  If we can get a few things out of it, there are several tslibs modules that can drop that large dependency.  Plus having things in cython makes it easier to test+profile+measure coverage."
