    "body": "Eventually, there seems to be 2 different bugs.\n\nThe problem with head() may not be so relevant, cause if you groups columns, when you show the head of each group you see the head of the whole df. Yet, the error's still here and maybe address with an exception or warning (cause atm it's silent when you have more rows than columns.).\n\nThe pb with apply seems to be a bit deeper. The given function is applied without transmitting the 'axis' argument given in the first groupby call. I couldn't find where this 'axis' argument is stored, if so. Would you agree setting a new attribute to BaseGrouper class, so as to remind the orientation of the build ? If so I will propose a correction.\n"

In the original example, it's actually not possible to pass in the axis argument even if we knew to try:\n\n``` .python\n>>> df_g.apply(lambda x : x.sum(), axis=1)\n...\nTypeError: <lambda>() got an unexpected keyword argument 'axis'\n```\n\nIf you want to pass an extra argument, you can add an argument to the lambda and pass it to `apply`, or you could just pass it directly:\n\n``` .python\n>>> df_g.apply(lambda x, axis : x.sum(axis=axis), axis=1)\n>>> df_g.apply(lambda x: x.sum(axis=1))\n```\n\nWe _could_ actually inspect the arguments of the passed-in function using reflection, and pass through the axis parameter whenever it takes an argument named 'axis', but that seems like it might be overkill:\n\n``` .python\n>>> import inspect\n>>> inspect.getargspec(lambda x, axis : x.sum(axis=axis))\nArgSpec(args=['x', 'axis'], varargs=None, keywords=None, defaults=None)\n```\n"
