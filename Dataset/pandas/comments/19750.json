I am mixed about quoting in doc-strings, because they are rendered as text quite a lot and it is slightly distracting, but obviously nicer when html rendered.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to not quote DataFrame/Series, but then actually insert them on the rendering?\r\n\r\nThis solves the lightweight problem & I think can be done unambiguously (e.g. DataFrame/Series with a space in front and not followed by . or ()\r\n\r\nI would prefer to keep the quoting in the docs personally."
