    "body": "I understand the other datatypes, but I'm thinking we can change `array_equal` with `all(isclose(a, b))` and that would make a faster comparison of numpy types and would not have an issue with NaNs (this is essentially what is done anyways, numerics are compared at 5x10-6).  This should create no difference to existing tests.  I feel like the pandas testing api should provide a reliable way to test the equivalence of two dataframes.  I am using it for my own unit tests and came across this being quite slow.\n"
