    "body": "Um, you installed pandas from the git repo or from PyPI (either is fine)? As you can see I haven't touched the examples in quite a while, and for example I removed the deprecated fillMethod argument from reindex very recently. I plan to make a pass through the docs in the next week or two to update them given all the work I've been putting in on the library. Thanks for letting me know about the examples, I'll take a look and fix them up to be in line with the present API.\n\nThe second error is rather weird. I would strongly suggest upgrading your scikits.statsmodels and trying again:\n\nhttp://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikits.statsmodels/\n\nLet me know\n"
