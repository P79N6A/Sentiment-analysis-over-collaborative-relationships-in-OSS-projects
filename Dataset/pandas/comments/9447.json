    "body": "well this was fixed in 0.14 mentioned here: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew.html#groupby-api-changes\niirc then needes a bug fix in 0.14.1. there are also big warning sections (in red) that highlite what the different groupby operators are supposed to do\n\nyou happened upon a case that is really just a bug and did not do what it states it should have done\nso you were relying on the bug\n\nthis is the point of the whatsnew and the docs represent a single versions\nif u upgrade then it is your responsibility to read the whatsnew \nthat is where changes are documented that could break the api\n\nI suppose there could be a bit more of the whatsnew behavior in the current docs\n\nso if u find things unclear then propose a pull request to clarify \n"

    "body": "I had read the page you linked, but I didn't find anything applying to my case. I see \"groupby will now not return the grouped column for non-cython functions (GH5610, GH5614, GH6732), as its already the index\"... but in my case it's the index level which appears/is missing, not the column.\n\nAnyway, I will propose a PR for the autogenerated docs (because from the current docs I would expect the behavior of last year, i.e. without group column).\n"
