It does make a difference however and supplying the single unchanging format slows this operation significantly. The date format I put in, %Y-%m-%d, is a valid ISO8601 date if perhaps not a datetime. Seeing how '%Y%m%d' is given a fast-path perhaps that string could also get one.\n\nhttps://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/tseries/tools.py#L297\n\n``` python\nif format == '%Y%m%d' or format == '%Y-%m-%d':\n    try:    \n        result = _attempt_YYYYMMDD(arg, coerce=coerce)\n    except:\n        raise ValueError(\"cannot convert the input to '%Y%m%d' date format\")\n```\n\nA change like that would necessitate a change _attempt _YYYYMMDD that would involve using a split on the hyphen and I don't know if that is agreeable. I don't really mind that inferring is quicker than being told but it is certainly not obvious behaviour when you have put in an ISO8601 date string to start.\n"
