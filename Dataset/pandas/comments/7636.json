    "body": "I have to second this request, since it would fix a related problem: currently (version 0.14), the legend colors don't actually match the ones that show up in the graph. Thus, it is impossible to tell which category is which, and if you have more than a few categories, with the default settings, the colors quickly repeat. Screenshot is attached for an example - there are at least 2 categories that show up as medium blue in the graph, and I don't see either of them in the legend, although I suspect they're among the purple boxes? And the two green categories appear identical in the plot (and their order doesn't match the legend, either). FWIW, I noticed the same thing is also true in the example in the docs (http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html) \n\nmy example: \n![screen shot 2014-08-13 at 4 18 56 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5185401/3914028/3e88ac7a-2340-11e4-88d6-329050727028.png)\n\nthe docs (where the colors are closer, but not matching - I'm guessing it's something with an alpha layer/transparency issue)? \n\n![screen shot 2014-08-13 at 4 20 52 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5185401/3914049/a0ef7d12-2340-11e4-8068-d89cfef14a96.png)\n"
