    "body": "I've only tried it on 20.2 and the latest dev version, so I don't know if it ever worked. I've never encountered it in the wild, just while writing tests for my PR. It's easy for me to imagine situations where it could happen (e.g. by appending a file that starts with a newline to a file that ends with a newline) but I googled a bit and don't see any SO questions or similar, so maybe it isn't common.\r\n\r\nI've already fixed it (and written a test) in my PR, so at this point it's less effort to leave it fixed. If you feel strongly that this is malformed and we should reject it, I'd just recommend we do so more explicitly, since that exception is pretty deep down the call stack and not particularly useful.
