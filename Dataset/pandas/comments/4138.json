    "body": "but really i was referring to algos and things made by `generated.py` because that's where most of the bottleneck is and most of the repetition across types. right now pandas is generating types manually where fused types are similar to templates they allow you to write the code once and let the compiler (Cython) take care of generating the code  for the different types. what's kind of cool is that you can use the function like a dict where the keys are types and the values are the specific function for that type which might allow you to fine tune if you needed to, at a higher level\n"
