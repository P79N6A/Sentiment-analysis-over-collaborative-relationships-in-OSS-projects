    "body": "wes, sorry to hear you had a snafu in front of an audience. \n\nThe updated behaviour has a consistent story and took a _lot_ of noodling to make \nsure it behaved sanely under a substantial number of corner cases.\n\nIt seems the end result of that is crappy UX from your POV. Disappointing\nto hear considering how little fun I had trying to make it work.\n\nAn easy fix is to just set the width to something large on ipnb by default. \nTo let users opt in to activating the limit rather then loosening it.\n\nThat code doesn't need more special cases, it _really_ does not, \nI agree that consideration is trumped by UX though.\n"
