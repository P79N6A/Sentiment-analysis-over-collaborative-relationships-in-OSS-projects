But I just want to point out that this behaviour is intentional and documented (see also http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html#index-columns-and-trailing-delimiters), so in any case not a bug. \nAnd given that fact, I think changing this default behaviour would not be a good idea IMO.\n\nAnd I agree that there is currently not a good way to _both_ ignore the trailing comma's (using `index_col=False` and setting the first column as the index (as `index_col` is already used for the first part ..). Apart from doing it in two steps of course with `pd.read_csv(..., index_col=False).set_index('A')`\n"
