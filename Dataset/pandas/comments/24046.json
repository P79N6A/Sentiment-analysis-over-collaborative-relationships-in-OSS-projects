    "body": "@h-vetinari While I think locking #22225 was an unnecessary move from @jreback , you have to realize that the \"''[overruling approving reviews](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/22225)''\" thing is not a good argument to raise in such a discussion. True, in pandas we look for devs consensus, but in the end we prefer to do so by argumenting rather than by any form of proper vote. So that comment was not very useful, to use an euphemism.\r\n\r\nBack to the topic of the discussion: if I understand correctly, @jreback is argumenting that ``df.set_index`` is already ambiguous enough to make it a bad idea to sponsor its use when passing anything but keys (which would be the only sensible use in ``Series.set_index``); and at the same time, you are suggesting that\r\n\r\n>  [ ] For Series, the `set_index` and `set_axis` methods should be exactly the same.\r\n\r\nIf this summary of the discussion is correct, then I think I am also against introducing ``Series.set_index``.\r\n\r\nAnd actually, I'm probably in favor of deprecating ``df.set_index`` to pass actual values, if ``df.set_axis`` is able to fulfill exactly the same task (didn't check).\r\n\r\nI understand you argument about ``df.set_index`` being what one expects to use to set the ``.index`` (to some values)... but ``set_axis`` is simply too long established to be removed, and I find duplication in the API a worse problem than the maybe sub-optimal naming. Or in other words, I think \r\n\r\n> The `axis`-kwarg of `set_axis` should just switch between the behaviour of `set_index` (i.e. dealing with keys _and_ array-likes) and `set_columns`.\r\n\r\nis a bad idea. _''There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it.\"_\r\n\r\nEDIT: By the way: sorry for not reacting before to the ping - busy period."

I think @jreback makes a good point however that there is no obvious reason (except parameter ambiguity) for ``df.set_index(a_list_of_labels)`` not to work (since ``df.set_index(Series(a_list_of_labels))`` does), and that this causes a potential confusion that ``df.set_axis`` doesn't. Then maybe we can live with it... but let's admit this is not ideal.\r\n\r\nOne alternative (which I don't particularly like) is what (I think) ``.groupby(a_list)`` does, i.e., trying to find elements of ``a_list`` in the axis, and fallback to considering them as values otherwise.\r\n"

But as already stated, if ``df.set_index(values_rather_than_keys)`` is a regrettable legacy causing ambiguity in the API, we'd rather not enhance its usage by paralleling it with ``Series.set_index``, which would do _only_ that (which is already done by ``Series.set_axis``). I actually [suggested](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/24046#issuecomment-451827403) deprecating it... which might not be our final decision, but is certainly related to #22225 ."

[master](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.set_index.html):\r\n> **keys** : *column label or list of column labels / arrays*\r\n\r\nThis parameter bullet has no description either, so that last \"/ arrays\" has to be counted as documentation for sure, IMO.\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n> @toobaz: By the way: this is the only reason I see for not deprecating/discouraging passing values to `DataFrame.set_index`... and it is a use case that `Series.set_index` would not cover.\r\n\r\nWhy not make `DataFrame.set_axis(..., axis=0)` equal in capabilities to `DataFrame.set_index`? The main part is `set`ting the `index`, and yes, for `DataFrames` one can reasonably use existing columns instead of arrays. But how would this be contradicting the fundamental purpose of `set_axis`? I mean, a frame has two axes, right...? Assuming someone thinks \"I want to `set` this `axis`\", why not let them set it with the same capabilities as `set_index`?\r\n\r\nTo this end, I don't agree with your point further up the thread that having `set_axis(..., axis=0) == set_index` [and `set_axis(..., axis=1) == set_columns`] would violate the zen of python. Each of those methods has a clear and distinct purpose, but `set_index` is more specialised than `set_axis` (which is why one could easily dispatch from the latter to the former)."

    "body": "> Why not make `DataFrame.set_axis(..., axis=0)` equal in capabilities to `DataFrame.set_index`?\r\n\r\nOK, I think we're (I'm, at least) getting lost... so forget for a moment the current API, assume we start from scratch. We want the following:\r\n\r\n1. set ``DataFrame.index`` from single column key\r\n2. set ``DataFrame.index`` from sequence of values\r\n3. set ``DataFrame.index`` from sequence of column keys\r\n4. set ``DataFrame.index`` from sequence of sequences of values\r\n5. mix 3. and 4.\r\n\r\nAll of these are good. Problem: a ``list`` of scalars is both a valid sequence of values (2.) and a potentially valid sequence of column keys (3.). There are two ways around the ambiguity: either (my preferred choice) we split functionalities 1. and 3. vs. 2. and 4. in two different methods, discarding 5., or we make an arbitrary choice and document it.\r\n\r\nNow, back to the current API. We have ``set_index`` that does all of this, we have the ambiguity between 3. and 3., resolved in favor of 3.I don't like this, but other devs suggest it's not so problematic, that 5. is worth keeping, and certainly we can at least document everything better.\r\n\r\nThen we have a method which does cleanly precisely what it is expected to: ``set_axis`` (it does 2. and 4.). Can we please at least agree on not making it ambiguous too, or deprecating it? Then we can continue the discussion on ``set_index`` ;-)"
