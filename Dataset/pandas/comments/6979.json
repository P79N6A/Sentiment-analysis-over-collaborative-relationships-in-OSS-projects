    "body": "I really have no opinion on what is the proper definition of the mode function. But my use case becomes more complicated to implement if mode() does not return the most common element, even if it only occurs once. My use case was to reimplement the kaggle titanic survival tutorial with pandas. For the first exercise the training data created with three properties (A,B,C) and the outcome (Y), and the classifier returns the most common value corresponding to the features (A,B,C). I (naively?) thought that I can use the mode for this, but if the definition does not return a value when the training data occurs only once, then I will have to code around it. Not a big deal, but uglier.\n"
