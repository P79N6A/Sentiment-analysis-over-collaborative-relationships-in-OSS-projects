    "body": "great 2 hear!\n\nissue #2391 is an older list of todos\n\na couple of possibilities:\n\nreal dtype integration is coming on PR #2708 (eg even though 0.10.1 will actually read/write float32 columns u can't really do much with them w/o having them upcasted) - in any event I think HDFStore will accommodate this already\n\none big area is to test whether data columns really are slower; it thus may make sense to make data columns = True the default (but not necessarily index them)\n\nare u familiar with R? I think could make export a bit easier (there is a section in docs, but maybe a dedicated option. / function)\n\nhave some more thoughts but maybe will start a new issue\n"
