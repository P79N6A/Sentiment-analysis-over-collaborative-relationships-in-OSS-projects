    "body": "@jtratner OK so to recap:\n1. Add `optional` to `colspecs` docs.\n2. Move all `test*.fwf` files directly to `test_parser.py` as strings.\n3. In the case of files that cannot be sniffed properly, you will just end up with two columns merged into one or one column separated into two. No exception will be thrown.\n   For example:\n   \n   ```\n   N    A          Name\n   123foo   Joe Doe\n   345bar   Joe Smith \n   455baz   Abe Lincoln\n   ```\n   \n   Even though the header suggests there are three columns, the parser is not able to found the boundary between the first and the second. Also the third column will be split into two since first name and last name are clearly separated.\n   If you have just one name with four letters:\n   \n   ```\n   N    A          Name\n   123foo   Joe Doe\n   345bar   Joe Smith \n   455baz   Abe Lincoln\n   333brb   Jack Lastname\n   ```\n   \n   Then the parser will correctly parse the third column, because the clear separation is broken. (In this case it would be the second column since the first two cannot be separated).\n4. About the very wide files. I tested this and it works just fine. The width of the file doesn't make any difference in parsing, because I'm not counting anything. It will just create a bigger one dimensional ndarray. I didn't thought it's necessary the test something that doesn't check any edge case or does anything differently. But I'll add that if you think it's necessary. No prob :)\n5. Multiple characters delimiters will work fine, but strings and regexes wont. So telling the parser something like `delimiter='+~'` will slit the line on `+` and `~` characters. But telling the parser to split whenever it finds a `+-~` sequence wont. That didn't worked even before this change. Here is an untouched line of code from before that shows why:\n   \n   ``` python\n   return [line[fromm:to].strip(self.delimiter)\n           for (fromm, to) in self.colspecs]\n   ```\n   \n   There is no regex `strip`, at least not a trivial one, so I think that this is just an unnecessary complication and shouldn't be implemented. So I'll just add tests that check for correctness of this.\n6. Add tests that check unicode delimiters and unicode files.\n"
