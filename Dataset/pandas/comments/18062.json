    "body": "My original thought was wrong, but the problem here seems to stem from the _maybe_dedup_names function. I edited the function to the below:\r\n\r\n    def _maybe_dedup_names(self, names):\r\n        ...\r\n        if self.mangle_dupe_cols:\r\n            names = list(names)  # so we can index\r\n            counts = defaultdict(int)\r\n\r\n            for i, col in enumerate(names):\r\n                if isinstance(col, tuple):\r\n                    continue\r\n                ...\r\n\r\nAnd this worked as intended. However, this assumes that multi-indexed columns will always be passed in as a tuple, which I'm not sure is valid. An alternate approach would be to differentiate between strings and tuples / lists, but I wasn't sure off the top of my head of a completely reliable way to do that across all Python versions, so there could be some complexity trade-offs there.\r\n\r\n@TomAugspurger  - do you have a point of view on this? The above would be the simplest solution, but I'm certainly happy to work on something a more robust if we want to handle more than tuples and feel its worth the added complexity. Let me know what you think and I can work something up in a PR"

Indeed, duplicate data is annoying to handle in `pandas`, and while we've mostly ironed out the single-column case, it does not surprise me that something would have broken in the `MultiIndex` case.\r\n\r\nI think you should augment `_maybe_dedup_names` to account for the `MultiIndex` case more carefully.  I agree with your suggest though to \"dedup\" at the lowest row.  Give it a shot in a PR!"
