    "body": "Hi, @jorisvandenbossche \r\n\r\n> a problem with the current proposal: it looks like valid code, but is actually not\r\n\r\nI consider this a worthwhile tradeoff, but in the future we can maybe change the signature for ``MultiIndex``:\r\n1. Change attribute name ``labels`` to ``codes`` (see #13443)\r\n2. add a ``MultiIndex.from_codes`` class method \r\n3. Change ``MultiIndex.__init__`` signature to be similar to the current ``from_tuples``.\r\n\r\n> About truncating the tuples itself if it would go over one line (the \"column-wise truncation according to pd.options.display.width,\"), I am not really sure about that. It really makes it very difficult to see what is in your MI object. We could also let the tuples overflow?\r\n\r\nDataFrames also truncate (though in a slightly different way), so the same problem is there also? Maybe users who want to see all the values could be advised to adjust ``display.width``?  \r\n\r\n> The ``dtype=object`` might be a bit confusing.\r\n\r\nYeah, I agree. I can remove it, and it can be added back again to the repr if/when a ``MultiDtype`` is added? (got no idea if that's in the cards)\r\n\r\n> You now used options.display.max_seq_items to determine how many values to show. Which is certainly a reasonable choice (since the other indexes do the same). However, I have the feeling that this can give quite long outputs (of course only when still below the 100) compared to other index classes, because here each element is put under each other. Eg pd.MultiIndex.from_product([['a', 'abc'], range(50)]) gives a really long output\r\n\r\nI see your point and agree it can be long. The same problem can be said about DataFrame though. The current implementation has the advantage that it follows the usual conventions from Pandas, as you mention. Do you have a proposal how it could be better/shorter and still reasonably consistent?\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "> I consider this a worthwhile tradeoff, but in the future we can maybe change the signature for MultiIndex:\r\n>\r\n>    - Change attribute name labels to codes (see #13443)\r\n>    - add a MultiIndex.from_codes class method\r\n>    - Change MultiIndex.__init__ signature to be similar to the current from_tuples.\r\n\r\nThis hasn't been discussed yet AFAIK (the first item you list is only a name-change, not changing the structure of the constructor), so I wouldn't let the repr depend on that.\r\n\r\n> > About truncating the tuples itself if it would go over one line (the \"column-wise truncation according to pd.options.display.width,\"), I am not really sure about that. It really makes it very difficult to see what is in your MI object. We could also let the tuples overflow?\r\n>\r\n> DataFrames also truncate (though in a slightly different way), so the same problem is there also? Maybe users who want to see all the values could be advised to adjust display.width?\r\n\r\nYep, that is true, and that can be annoying as well. Although for DataFrame you have other ways to inspect as well (eg `.info()`) and other options to deal with this (eg `max_columns`). Changing `display.width` would then also impact other things (but that is maybe not a problem).\r\n\r\nBut I think it would at least be useful to still see 'something' about the levels (apart from the name), such as the dtype?\r\n\r\n> I see your point and agree it can be long. The same problem can be said about DataFrame though. The current implementation has the advantage that it follows the usual conventions from Pandas, as you mention. Do you have a proposal how it could be better/shorter and still reasonably consistent?\r\n\r\nYep, we have been having some discussion to shorten it for DataFrame as well (where it is already a bit shorter, i.e. 60 instead of 100). I suppose the better path forward is to keep following the `options.display.max_seq_items` option as you did, but maybe have a general discussion about the option, such as a lower default (or a variable default, like show everything up to 100, but above that only show first/last 10)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nTrying to think out of the box, just some random ideas together here, a possible other repr (using the `wide_multi_index` from the conftest.py in this PR):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<pandas.MultiIndex>\r\nLevels (5):\r\n    * a: category (2) ['a', 'abc']\r\n    * b: int64 (2) [9, 10]\r\n    * dti_1: datetime64[ns] (2000) ['2000-01-01 00:00:00', ... ] \r\n    * dti_2: datetime64[ns] (2000) ['2000-01-01 00:00:00', ... ] \r\n    * dti_3: datetime64[ns] (2000) ['2000-01-01 00:00:00', ... ] \r\n[ ('a',    9, '2000-01-01 00:00:00', '2000-01-01 00:00:00', '2000-01-01 00:00:00'),\r\n  ('a',    9, '2000-01-01 00:00:01', '2000-01-01 00:00:01', '2000-01-01 00:00:01'),\r\n  ('a',    9, '2000-01-01 00:00:02', '2000-01-01 00:00:02', '2000-01-01 00:00:02'),\r\n  ...,\r\n  ('abc', 10, '2000-01-01 00:33:17', '2000-01-01 00:33:17', '2000-01-01 00:33:17'),\r\n  ('abc', 10, '2000-01-01 00:33:18', '2000-01-01 00:33:18', '2000-01-01 00:33:18'),\r\n  ('abc', 10, '2000-01-01 00:33:19', '2000-01-01 00:33:19', '2000-01-01 00:33:19')],\r\nLenght: 2000\r\n``` \r\n\r\n(basically, not trying to look like valid code, which makes it possible to give more information about the individuals levels, together with the same kind of display of the data you did now)"
