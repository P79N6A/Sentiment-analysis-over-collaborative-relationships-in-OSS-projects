Jake, what is the return of:\n\n```\ndata.y = 5 \nd2 = data.y**2\nd2.y\n```\n\nIn regard to subclassing Frames, I actually don't do that per-se in my package; however, I know GeoPandas does.  We use a composite class, so we're not storing attributes on the DataFrame.  Of course, if it ever does come to the point that the DataFrame can store arbitrary attributes, it would require us to rethink the design I'm sure.  In fact, I do plan to rework this in the future to subclass like GeoPandas.  But in any case, I guess to summarize my thoughts is I'd say if this PR is generally good for Pandas, then +1 and we will work around any changes you guys make.   It might be helpful to get someone from GeoPandas to check this out too.\n"
