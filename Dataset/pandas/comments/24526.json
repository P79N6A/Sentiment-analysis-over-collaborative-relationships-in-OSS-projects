    "body": "@jreback - this error is generated from a section that `Check that no file in the repo contains tailing whitespaces` . Adding a exclusion for c (and cpp) files will  prevent this errors for all c/cpp files in the repo and not just those generated from .pyx files. However,  c/cpp files inside `pandas/_libs`  are linted in another test. I believe adding exception should be okay. "
