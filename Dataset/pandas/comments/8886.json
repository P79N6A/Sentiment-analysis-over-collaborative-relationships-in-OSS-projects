    "body": "There are definitely other ways to get this done, but it is (in my opinion) rather confusing that integers arguments are treated as offsets in `ns`, especially given that the default frequency is different. The use of ns internally is a rather arcane implementation detail...\n\nSo my vote is that this should raise and we don't need any other changes. The main reason I like having a `unit` argument is that it makes it clear that the units for the bounds are not the same thing as the frequency.\n"
