    "body": "Thanks for CCing me Stephan.  I absolutely have encountered.  I still havent' gotten around to updating scikit-spectra to pandas > 0.14 (lots of other projects, grad school), so in 0.14, I can't even test some of this because it would result in an error.  Therefore, I'm **pleased** to see that you at least get output in these operations.\n\n```\ns2 = pd.Series(range(3), s1.index + 0.15 - 0.15)\n\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-3-dbbad8e288fd> in <module>()\n      4 s1 = pd.Series(range(3), np.arange(3.0))\n      5 \n----> 6 s2 = pd.Series(range(3), s1.index + 0.15 - 0.15)\n\n/home/adam/Enthought/Canopy_32bit/User/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pandas/core/index.pyc in __sub__(self, other)\n    959 \n    960     def __sub__(self, other):\n--> 961         return self.diff(other)\n    962 \n    963     def __and__(self, other):\n\n/home/adam/Enthought/Canopy_32bit/User/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pandas/core/index.pyc in diff(self, other)\n   1112 \n   1113         if not hasattr(other, '__iter__'):\n-> 1114             raise TypeError('Input must be iterable!')\n   1115 \n   1116         if self.equals(other):\n\nTypeError: Input must be iterable!\n```\n\nStill using 0.14.1 on this machine.  For the most part, I've just avoided dealing with this issue, but am glad to see it's not just me losing my marbles!\n"
