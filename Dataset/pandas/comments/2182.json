    "body": "@saroele Your compiler will be invoked when you compile Cython code and (roughly) whenever you're using a statically typed language such as Java, C, or C++. I say roughly because, there are exceptions to such a rule (some languages blur the lines between interpretation and compilation). [Just-in-time compilation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) is an example of this.\n\nPython itself is an interpreted language, but the CPython interpreter is written in C. There are other implementations of Python in Java and [even in Python itself](http://pypy.org).\n\nI'm not very familiar with Windows but I've used Cygwin and a quick Google search suggests that commonly used compilers on Windows are `msvc` and `mingw32`. [This Stack Overflow question and answer](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/724664/python-distutils-how-to-get-a-compiler-that-is-going-to-be-used) should help you out.\n\nOne way to track down the bug is to write a Python script that causes the crash and call `gdb python`. Once you're in GDB, type `run my_buggy_script.py`. This will only be useful if you have a debug version of Python, otherwise GDB will just give you memory addresses in hex instead of symbol names. This shouldn't be a problem however, since it sounds like you're compiling Python from the source, so just Google around for the necessary compiler flags to enable debugging symbols.\n"
