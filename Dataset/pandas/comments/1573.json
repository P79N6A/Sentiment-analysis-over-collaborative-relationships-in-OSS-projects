And there tends to be more variety of use cases for specifying monthly offsets.\n\nWould you be interested in helping out with a PR? If you don't want to make separate DateOffset for this, just make sure that MonthBegin and the business month offsets also get the same treatment as MonthEnd. All that code is in pandas.tseries.offsets\n\nThanks!\n"
