See [Docs label](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ADocs)\n\n**Getting our ASV benchmark suite up to speed**\n- Recently the benchmark suite has been converted to ASV (which should support python 3 and windows), but there is still some clean-up / testing needed: https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/10849\n\n**Do you use latex / DataFrame.to_latex? There are quite some, but rather easy bugs to fix!**\n- The list can be seen with the label [IO LaTeX](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22IO+LaTeX%22) (perfect to work with a small group together on this, as these several issues can possibly interfere)\n\n**Familiar with rpy2?**\n- There are still some things that should be moved over there: #9602 \n\n**Using the SQL import/export functions?**\n- Enhancement to add `dtype` keyword to read_sql_query: #10285 \n- Enhancement: support SQLAlchemy Select object in read_sql_query: #10846\n- Enhancement (but needs some design thought): add `get_schema` as public function: #9960 (related: add `index` keyword to get_schema: #9084)\n\nSome other things:\n- Lots of bugs, see the [Difficulty Novice](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Difficulty+Novice%22) label\n"
