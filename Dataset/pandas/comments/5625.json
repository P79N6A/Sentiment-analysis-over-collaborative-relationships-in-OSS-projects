    "body": "@y-p okay.\n\nIn working on this, I realized that config_prefix was actually broken, you can pass: `set_option(pat, val, pat, val, pat, val)` and only the first `pat` was being prefixed (everything else was just passed through).   It was already modifying global variables, given that it was swapping out `set_option`, `get_option`, `register_option`, etc (such that you couldn't use `from` imports with the module), so it seemed simpler to only swap out the prefix_key method. I'll come up with a way to not need to use a separate prefix keyword but still be able to keep track of what to undo.\n\nI guess this also doesn't work with nested `config_prefix` calls, so I should fix that too.\n"
