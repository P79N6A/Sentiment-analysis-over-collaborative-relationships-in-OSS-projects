    "body": "Hmm. Getting the name / API design right here is a little tricky.\n\nMy thought was that `max_distance` makes the most sense in terms of selecting nearest values.\n\nOn the other hand, `precision`/`tol` (or `atol`/`abs_tol`?) makes more sense in the context of imprecise matches / floating point issues. When providing a tolerance or precision, it seems implicit that you're doing nearest neighbor lookups, i.e., `precision=0.1` would imply `method='nearest'`.\n\n~~For alignment purposes, we probably want an API that looks similar to [`math.isclose`](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0485/), which has the signature `isclose(a, b, rel_tol=1e-9, abs_tol=0.0)` and returns the result of `abs(a-b) <= max(rel_tol * max(abs(a), abs(b)), abs_tol)`.~~\n"
