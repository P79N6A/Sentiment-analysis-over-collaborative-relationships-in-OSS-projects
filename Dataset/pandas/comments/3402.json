    "body": "Hi,\n\nThanks for the thoroughly-researched idea-issue.\nMost of the spec links you provided are exploratory in practice, and have yet (to my knowledge)\ntaken over the world. Controversially probably, I'm including RDF in that statement, which \nhas certainly gotten a lot of attention and there are real services built on top of it (freebase,\nopencalais, semantic search engines and so on).\n\nDataFrame metadata has come up again and again, please read through the (long) metadata \ndiscussion in #2495  to catch up on some the issues already discussed.\n#3297 is planned for 0.12, but has nothing to do with RDF and has very limited scope, since\nit's intended to answer a different use-case. However, users would be free to\nembed their own JSON schemas under .meta, so it's somewhat open-ended. \n\nThe next step after that,  embedding metadata in axis labels is interesting, but right now isn't \nplanned for a specific release. Although I'm sure, the [`quantities'](http://pythonhosted.org/quantities/user/tutorial.html) users would find that useful. \n\nIMO, it's premature to bake these specs into pandas at this point in the life of \nthe semantic web. \nIs there a fundamental reason why all this can't be done in an auxiliary package, \non top of pandas?\n\nThat's my opinion, other devs may feel differently.\n"

But the benefits of working with XML and EDIFact-based formats such as described on http://sdmx.org/ are obvious. \n\nI don't know what level of generality would be appropriate to IO just SDMX. But it might be interesting to look at Eurostat's SDMX Reference Implementation and the other material available at. \n\nhttps://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/sdmx/index.php.\n\nStarting \"small\" with SCMX might be appropriate to do within pandas.

    "body": "All this looks very interesting.\n\nAgain, I recommend a deeper dive into CubicWeb, a web framework \nsupporting RDF and other semantic web standards. It also implements a \nSparQL-like query language called RQL. Apart from reusing some of its \ncore components it seems worth exploring whether in the long term \nCubicWeb could be used as a web front end for admin and representation \ntasks relating to datasets.\n\nThere is no doubt a lot of speculation in these statements. But we \nshould avoid reinventing wheels.\n\nthe pandas.io.wb.py module is a children's game compared to teaching \npandas RDF. The latter goal should probably be pursued in a separate \nproject such as pandas-rdf or pandas-sdmx, as has been suggested before. \nThat said, I know nothing about the relationship between RDF and SDMX.\n\nWriting pandas.io.eurostat.py, oecd.py bis.py modules along the lines of \nwb.py should not be too difficult, especially if one focuses on CSV \nformatted data. Still, using SDMX could make the user's life much easier \nand richer.\n\nTo add both complexity and to the links collection: Some elements of the \nSDMX standard build on EDIFACT. Here,\n\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/bots-open-source-edi-translator/version%203.0.0 \n\ncould come in handy.\n\nAm 25.07.2013 22:28, schrieb Wes Turner:\n\n> General Ontology Resources:\n> - http://lov.okfn.org\n> - http://prefix.cc\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub \n> https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/3402#issuecomment-21582221.\n"

    "body": "2 comments here:\n1. I'd encourage anyone interested in connecting SDMX to pandas to either submit a PR to pandas or work on a Python reader and then submit a PR to hook the package into pandas.  That's the best way to get support support for SDMX into pandas, especially if the spec is 100s of pages _and_ there's an option to load from csv. (and you'd end up with the same thing from loading SDMX into pandas vs. loading csv to pandas).\n2. Special support for RDF is not within scope for pandas right now both because of what @y-p said and because it's not clear how users would want to use it (particularly if this is complex enough to require query languages). I'd imagine that you could keep the RDF descriptors in a column (or whatever you need to use for comparison) and then use those descriptors to traverse after you're finished transforming the data.\n\nIf you need help hooking in an already-written SDMX reader into pandas, feel free to ask.\n"

This appears to be a strong candidate for a meta-ticket, which I do understand are not usually specifically helpful. This may very well belong out of core (`import rdflib`, most likely), but this seems to be a good place to coordinate efforts. To be clear, I have no working generalized implementation of this: I have one-offs for specific datasets and it seems wasteful. A `read_rdf` and a `to_html5_rdfa` could be so helpful.\n\nStoring columnar RDF dataset metadata out-of-band from [`Series.meta` and `DataFrame.meta`](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/3643) is the easiest thing to do right now.\n\nFor the meantime, for reference, above are links to SDMX and (newer, more comprehensive) RDF Data Cube Vocabulary standards.\n"
