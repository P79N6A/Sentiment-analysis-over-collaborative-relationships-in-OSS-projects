    "body": "Interesting idea :-). I don't have anything particularly useful to say, but two somewhat tangential thoughts:\n- In your example of a lambda accessing a variable from the \"local\" scope: this is actually creating a closure, so the variable isn't a local inside the lambda -- lookup for closed-over variables is implemented differently than for locals. For locals, the bytecode uses `LOAD_FAST`, which accesses the special hidden array of local variables:\n\n``` python\nIn [9]: def f():\n   ...:     x = 1\n   ...:     return x\n   ...: \n\nIn [10]: dis.dis(f)\n[...]\n  3           6 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)\n              9 RETURN_VALUE\n```\n\nBut for closed-over variables (`nonlocal` scope -- this is really what it's called :-)), Python uses LOAD_DEREF:\n\n``` python\nIn [11]: def f():\n   ....:     x = 1\n   ....:     return lambda: x\n   ....: \n\nIn [12]: dis.dis(f())\n  3           0 LOAD_DEREF               0 (x)\n              3 RETURN_VALUE\n```\n\nI'm not sure what LOAD_DEREF's semantics are exactly, but it involves loading a [cell object](https://docs.python.org/2/c-api/cell.html) attached to the function (`func.__closure__` on py3, maybe `.func_closure` on py2), and it might be possible to intercept that loading without all the dark magic. Or not, I haven't checked :-)\n- I may have mentioned this before, but I think we could make a reasonable proposal for getting actual runtime-evaluated macros in py 3.6 if someone cares enough to push it forward, with syntax like `df![sepal_length > 3]` where the `!` is a rust-style marker meaning \"this invocation gets passed the AST of its arguments instead of the actual values\". I don't have time / care enough to take point on this, but I'm happy to help out anyone who does want to take point.\n"

    "body": "> And there's always the possibility that something changes down the road in the CPython implementation itself that breaks this, I don't know the extent to which the semantics of these low-level pieces are official...\n\nThis specific implementation is less brittle than most -- far safer than @njsmith's context manager. Again, the implementation is all based on public API with the `types` module from the standard library:\n\n``` python\ndef injected(df, thunk):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate a thunk in the context of DataFrame\n\n    >>> df = pd.DataFrame({'x': [0, 1, 2]}, index=['a', 'b', 'c'])\n    >>> injected(df, lambda: x ** 2)\n    a    0\n    b    1\n    c    4\n    Name: x, dtype: int64\n    \"\"\"\n    new_globals = thunk.__globals__.copy()\n    new_globals.update(df)\n    new_thunk = types.FunctionType(thunk.__code__, new_globals, thunk.__name__,\n                                   thunk.__defaults__, thunk.__closure__)\n    return new_thunk()\n```\n\nThe problem is that we create the new injected variables as globals in the context of the function evaluation, which is not what one would expect. It's a bad thing is something like this works differently in IPython or a script than wrapped in a function:\n\n```\nx = 1\ndf.pipe(lambda: x)\n```\n\nIn theory, I think we could create a new closure object to create a new scope instead, but that starts to get down the dark magic path.\n\nOne thing we _could_ do is raise an error if injecting new variables would overwrite any global or non-local variables. We could do this by checking to make sure that `thunk.__closure__ is None` and that no dataframe columns are found in `thunk.__globals__`. But I worry that this wouldn't be very satisfying, either, because it's very common to write stuff code where you do use columns as local variables first, e..g,\n\n``` python\nx = ...\ndf['x'] = x\ndf[lambda: x > 500]\n```\n\n> Instead of a lambda, would it be possible to do this with some magic dataframe that deffers all evaluations until the context is given?\n\nNo, unfortunately not unless we're able to change Python itself, because Python builds in eager evaluation.\n\nOne viable alternative is the magic `X` from pandas-ply: http://pythonhosted.org/pandas-ply/\n"

    "body": "> But wouldnt it be possible to reduce the amount of required magic by going for the following syntax? It would require a magic object L.\n\nYes, in fact [pandas-ply](https://github.com/coursera/pandas-ply) already provides almost exactly this object in the form of `X`, though it might need a little bit of work to ensure `__call__` methods are defined appropriately such that we don't need to use `install_ply`. I'll open a new issue to discuss.\n"
