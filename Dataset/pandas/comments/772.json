Since repr would switch over to summary view if DataFrame is wider than terminal.\n\nOk, i will use the same switch over between full and summary for `_repr_html_` and `__repr__` and have a look at the missing class header.\n"

We should not fall back to the other representation if it is big.  This will require modifying the logic in to_html.\n- For this particular view, I would not do any additional styling - the notebook already has css to style these tables and leaving it alone will allow it to be consistent with the rest of the notebook.\n- The scrollable div should be pretty small - small enough that it easily fits in browser window at one time.  Otherwise we will run into weird double scrolling issues when both the div and window are trying to scroll.\n"

    "body": "Was patiently waiting for feedback, apparently my last comments did not reach github, so repeating\n- If print_config max_rows and max_columns are to be used, i would remove the scrollable div. Also I think there is no way to avoid double scrolling. Even if you make the div small, browser window can always be smaller, and a very small div looks rather impractical when using a full screen browser window.\n- Keeping the summary fall back option (although plain text), makes the html representation consistent with plain text display. I would keep this.\n- no css styling\n- had a look at why for the summary view the class header (=first line) is not printed. Apparently `'<pre>' + multi_line_string + '</pre>'` (currently used) is not the same as `'<pre>\\n' + multi_line_string + '\\n</pre>'`. From html point of view, both should be ok.\n- _print_config_ could have an extra option _notebook_html_, to be used in `_repr_html_()`, when _False_ `_repr_html_()` falls back to `__repr__()` wrapped in _pre_ tag. This way html representation can be disabled (kinda).\n- probably need to do this for _Series_ as well.\n"
