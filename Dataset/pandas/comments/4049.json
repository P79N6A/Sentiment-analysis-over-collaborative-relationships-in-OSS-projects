    "body": "@claell - Um, I don't think StyleFrame does it very well at all.\r\n\r\nLet me preface by saying I only discovered that Stack Overflow question today, and I had never heard of StyleFrame before. I actually am not even a pandas user, let alone a StyleFrame user, but I was intrigued so I installed it and gave it a try, based on the code in the SO answer. Here is what I get if I (1) modify the values a bit to accentuate potential column width differences, and (2) properly invoke the `best_fit` option (which does **not** seem to be the default):\r\n\r\n![example3_800x320](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4826859/46443718-c01ea880-c73c-11e8-93dc-46ca34995eae.png)\r\n\r\nHere is what it looks like if I copy the above data to a new, empty sheet and use Excel's AutoFit Column Width function:\r\n\r\n![reference_800x320](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4826859/46443726-c57bf300-c73c-11e8-961e-ccec9089061e.png)\r\n\r\nBig difference. The StyleFrame result is very far off, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nAt its core, the StyleFrame package seems to use the approach demonstrated in earlier answers to that SO question; namely, take the length of the string representation of the data, and call it a day. This is of course simple and straightforward to implement, but it's woefully coarse, especially given that virtually everyone uses either Calibri or Arial (both highly proportional fonts).\r\n\r\nI suppose other people must get better results than I just got, or they really don't care nearly as much as [I do](https://bitbucket.org/jky/cpytoxlsf.py/src/default/cpytoxlsx.py)."

    "body": "@jkyeung @claell \r\n\r\nHi, StyleFrame developer here.\r\n\r\n1. At no point StyleFrame's `best_fit` behavior was meant nor designed to produce the exact same output as Excel's AutoFit. I doubt if anyone outside Microsoft's Excel's team knows the \"formula\" or the source code executed when this button is clicked. When inspecting the generated VBA code one can see that an `AutoFit` flag is being used, but it has no affect when it is being modified by openpyxl. There is endless discussion about it on openpyxl's repository.\r\n\r\n2. StyleFrame's [documentation ](https://styleframe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_documentation.html?highlight=best_fit#to-excel) says\r\n\r\n> best_fit=None: (None | str | list | tuple | set) single column, list, set or tuple of columns names to attempt to best fit the width for.\r\n> Note: `best_fit` will attempt to calculate the correct column-width based on the longest value in each provided column. However this isn't guaranteed to work for all fonts (works best with monospaced fonts). The formula used to calculate a column's width is equivalent to\r\n> `(len(longest_value_in_column) + A_FACTOR) * P_FACTOR`\r\n> The default values for `A_FACTOR` and `P_FACTOR` are 13 and 1.3 respectively, and can be modified before calling `StyleFrame.to_excel` by directly modifying `StyleFrame.A_FACTOR` and `StyleFrame.P_FACTOR`\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It's quite clear what must be done to achieve something functionally similar to AutoFit. It's just immensely tedious and requires specific information about the fonts which you intend to support. I am not saying it's easy by any means, and I certainly have no criticism for anyone who doesn't want to go through that trouble. One day some determined soul might write a library for it (or it's already written, just not widely known), and then everyone can use that, but until then, I fully agree the benefit is not worth the development effort.\r\n\r\nI hope you didn't take offense at my assessment of StyleFrame's abilities.\r\n"
