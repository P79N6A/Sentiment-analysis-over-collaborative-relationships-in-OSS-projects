    "body": "The arguments to `duplicated` make more sense if you consider `drop_duplicates`, and realize the `df.drop_duplicates(take_last)` is equivalent to `df[~df.duplicated(take_last)]`.\n\nI agree that this is rather confusing. There is some symmetry here with the dropped duplicates always being the complement of the non-dropped duplicates, but I have no idea what `\"Take the last observed row in a row. Defaults to the first row\"` is supposed to mean. At the very least, it would be good to fix this docstring.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea to entirely reverse the meaning of `take_last` here, because that would silently break existing code relying on the existing behavior. But is _is_ an option to introduce a new parameter like you suggest and deprecate `take_last`.\n"

    "body": "It does look like existing underlying logic is correct, meaning that:\n\n```\nfull_df = df_without_duplicates + df_with_dropped_duplicates\n```\n\nIt is just the parameters sound a bit confusing to a new comer.\nIf parameter would be linked to action \"coded\" in the name of the function it would make it easier to understand:\n`duplicated()` suggests (to me at least :) that it can SHOW duplicated item therefore parameter `take` as in \"show me\" makes sense. And then `take last` would mean \"show me the last <row(s)> of the duplicated records\".\n\nBut in case of `drop_duplicates` the action DROP can suggest either what to KEEP or what to DROP.\nAnd here `take` is confusing as it is not clear what do you take it for (to keep or to drop).\nI guess ideally `drop_duplicates` needs a parameter like `drop` or `keep` (the first seems more obvious) taking the same values as `duplicated` but with clearer meaning.\n\n```\ndf.duplicated(take=first) == df.drop_duplicates(drop=last)\nTrue\n```\n\nAnd in no way I thought of replacing existing parameters but rather depreciating them like you suggested. \n"
