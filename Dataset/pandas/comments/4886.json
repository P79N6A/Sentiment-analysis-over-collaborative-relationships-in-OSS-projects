GH3541, GH3573\n```\n\nSo perhaps this is already improved, and I saw it in an older version. Linking those issues: #3541, #3573, and PR #3663 claiming to fix them.\n\nOh, and there's code which attempts to detect whether it's running in the Qt console or the notebook...sorry, that won't work all the time (the process which started a kernel isn't necessarily the same as the process making this execution request). I'll bring that up to try to work out a better way to do handle the difference.\n"

It always\nprovides schema information and \"query info\" such as number of rows.\nThe reason a small frame is displayed in it's entirety when it's \"small enough\" is that a view of \n_all_ the data _is_ a superset of the data in the info view (schema+number of records).\nBut yes, this can have a jarring \"jump-cut\" effect on new-users.\n\nAn alternative solution in 2 parts is:\n1. add a caption to the repr output describing type and display mode: \"DataFrame [data view]:\",\n\"Dataframe [info view]:\", \"Series [data view]:\". \nThat also distinguishes series from single column frames, another newbie gotcha.\n2. <del>The PR doesn't address the problem of</del> re: getting a glimpse of larger frames,\nthat's `df.head()`'s role, altering it to emit ellipsis for wider frames makes a lot of sense.\n(for html repr, and for text repr when `expand_frame_rapr` is off)\n\nI strongly urge conducting a small usability study (have a few users adopt it for a week \nand report) before making potentially disruptive change like this to UX.\n"

Showing the data with truncation is in line with numpy reprs and Series reprs, as well as regular Python reprs of collections (although they don't truncate).\n\nNot making it the default would defeat the entire point. New users are not going to hunt around in config settings to set this to behave intuitively. I don't even know what configuration file pandas uses. And I don't think another config setting is necessary: if you want to see the info view, use the `info()` method.\n\nI would love some people to do user testing - any volunteers? However, in uncontrolled user testing of the current behaviour, I have observed the sudden switch to a completely different repr confusing new users and annoying more experienced users.\n"
