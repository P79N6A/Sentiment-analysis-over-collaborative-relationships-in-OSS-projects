    "body": "@TomAugspurger Yes, I can work on this tonight. I encountered it on quite a big dataset running inside of a another application that uses pandas, so I'm going to have to do a bit of debugging to see how to reproduce this with a simpler input.\r\n\r\nIn general though, in the above code if self.delimiter is ever None during the execution of this line it will cause an error. I did make the quick patch proposed above to my pandas installation and the problem went away. I believe it is safe to make given that the following code executed in the conditional is just an error message related to a multi-char delimiter which wouldn't be applicable anyway if the delimiter was none.\r\n\r\nHowever there could be another issue earlier in the code if it is always expected that either the delimiter should have a default string value assignment such as a comma so that it has always len() method or self.quoting == csv.QUOTE_NONE whenever the delimiter does not have a value with a len() method.\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sure but it also might fix the issue by just rearranging the order of the conditionals so that \"self.quoting != csv.QUOTE_NONE\" is executed first so that if this evaluates to false it never checks \"len(self.delimiter)\""
