    "body": "How much memory does the machine you're running the tests on have?  My initial suspicion is that the machine simply doesn't have enough memory to run those specific tests.  We actually had a similar issue where these tests would intermittently crash fail on travis.  The cause was eventually determined to be a memory error when running the tests in distributed mode, due to another test that happened to be running concurrently pushing beyond the memory limit (hence these currently being marked as single).\r\n\r\nThe bug that's being tested here was a bit strange in that it only occurred when more than 2<sup>24</sup> rows were present, so the minimal unit test needed to have 2<sup>24</sup>+1 rows, which is why these tests need as much memory as they do.\r\n\r\nA couple options come to mind here:\r\n  - Adjust the test to try catching `MemoryError`, as @TomAugspurger  suggested\r\n  - Additionally mark the test with `@pytest.mark.high_memory` (looks like we only currently use this for one tests) so that users on low memory machines can optionally skip these tests.\r\n\r\nNot really sure which would be preferable, or if my low memory machine theory is even correct.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, it's certainly possible that there is a resource leak somewhere, or that memory isn't being used optimally, so investigations along those paths would certainly be welcome.
