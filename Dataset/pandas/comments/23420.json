I re-ran the same scripts, and, working of the same data, observed this behavior. I then checked my pandas version, and am fairly certain I had already installed the latest, but ran pip install --update pandas anyway. I wish I had retained the version info from before to be 100% certain, sorry. \r\n\r\nPerhaps what I describe above is not supposed to work at all? Then it's still puzzling that `==` does. "
