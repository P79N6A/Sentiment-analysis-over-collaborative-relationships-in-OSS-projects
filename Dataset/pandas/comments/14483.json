Obviously, .describe() can't contain everything, it should contains the \"commonly used\" ones; and what's \"commonly used\" for you may be different than for me. \n   But I would argue that (especially for financial applications) \"sum\" is a very common metric it's worth including. (If this were an exotic metric like \"kurtosis\" that most people don't understand, we wouldn't include it; but \"sum\" is useful to lots of people).\n\nIf I did all the work to add this (including test cases, etc) and submitted a PR, would you be willing to consider including it? \n"

    "body": "Thank you for considering this addition. I've drafted an implementation with a number of expanded tests in #14986.\r\n\r\nI would argue for including ``sum`` in ``describe`` because it is one of the most common descriptive statistics. \r\n\r\nI use it routinely in my work as a data journalist, and I can testify from my years as a trainer in the field that it is a routine tool for my peers. I now find myself adding an additional line to calculate the total every time I run ``describe``.  Adding ``sum`` to the mix would remove that requirement and make life easier for myself and others.\r\n\r\nBut you don't have to take my word for it. A sum is included in the default set of descriptive statistics in:\r\n\r\n- [Microsoft Excel](http://www.dummies.com/software/microsoft-office/excel/how-to-use-excels-descriptive-statistics-tool/) (Surely the most popular statistics software)\r\n- [LibreOffice's Calc](https://help.libreoffice.org/Calc/Data_Statistics_in_Calc) (The most popular open-source Excel variant)\r\n- Perl's [``Statistics::Descriptive``](http://search.cpan.org/~shlomif/Statistics-Descriptive-3.0612/lib/Statistics/Descriptive.pm) library\r\n- Python's [agate](http://agate.readthedocs.io/en/1.1.0/cookbook/statistics.html) library\r\n- SAS's [``PROC UNIVARIATE``](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/sas/modules/descript.htm) method\r\n\r\nI would add that R not having sum in ``summary`` can be looked at differently. By including it here, pandas will have what I would regard as a competitive edge. \r\n\r\nI see evidence that my view is not alone within the pandas community. The fact that ``sum`` features so prominently in the examples given for the new ``agg`` method in #14668 suggests to me there is an appetite to have it closer at hand."

    "body": "I certainly acknowledge that in certain (many) cases `sum` is an interesting statistics for a dataset, but, as I said above, there are also many cases where it does *not* make sense (eg certain measurements like concentrations, a set of observations like age, weight, length, .. of study objects, ...), while the current statistics (min, max, mean, ..) make sense in almost any case I think. \r\n\r\nSo the question is whether we want by default a 'meaningless' statistic included for certain cases, or rather an interesting statistic missing for other cases. And it's never possible to have a default that satisfies all cases .. \r\nPersonally I would go with the 'safe' option of not including it, but I am also certainly biased by the type of data I typically work with at the moment.\r\n"

(My emphasis).\r\n\r\n> \"Generates *descriptive statistics that summarize the central tendency, dispersion and shape of a dataset’s distribution*, excluding NaN values.\"\r\n\r\nMy hope is that it can provide a guide for evaluating future additions to the method that aren't based on the use cases of different users. Take a look and let me know what you think.\r\n\r\nTo me, if we accept this as the definition, we have a pretty strong case for excluding ``sum``, but it raises for me the question of whether it might make sense to add common statistics that do match the definition, like ``mode``, to the mix. If we appended them to the bottom of the current output, I think we could avoid the backwards breaking changes that @TomAugspurger rightly warns of. "
