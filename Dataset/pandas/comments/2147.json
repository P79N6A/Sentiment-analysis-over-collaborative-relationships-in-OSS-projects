    "body": "Thanks for explanation and your tip with indexing first\n\nMaybe it's just in Python's philosophy things to be like this, although I expected different outcome. For example in VBS I don't need to initialize variable to be able to do operation on it, as it's assumed to be 0 or empty or else (depending on context) if not set. I can just type `j=j+1`, and it would work, `j` would be `1` (which is handy in loops). In Python I would have to declare `j=0` first. Similar with lists.\n\nOK, I think that adding column to empty DataFrame perhaps could be improved by taking the index from added column length, but maybe it doesn't fit in global scheme.\n\nIs there other way of adding columns in DataFrame except `df[<column_label>] = <my_list>` that would work without initialization with index?\n"
