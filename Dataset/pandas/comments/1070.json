So, theoretically speaking, even the testing code in line 36 is for sqlite3, as long as there is converge for the error, it should catch it.\n\nBut it seems that it doesn't cover the error. I can not quickly add some code (just based on sqlit3 instead of pymysql) to cover the error, as I'm not familiar with the testing framework.\n"
