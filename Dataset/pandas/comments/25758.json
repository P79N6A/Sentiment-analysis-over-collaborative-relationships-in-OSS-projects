This means that of the two possible behaviours you suggest, only the first seems correct to me.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason someone wants to aggregate the data between `2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00` and `2018-11-04 00:00:00-05:00` with the data from the previous day (November 3rd), they would have to write a custom grouper (but I would be curious to know why exactly someone would want to do this as those 60 minutes unambiguously belong to November 4th in Cuba)."
