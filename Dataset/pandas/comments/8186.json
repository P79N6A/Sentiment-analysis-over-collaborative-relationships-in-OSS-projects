    "body": "Yeah, it's a direct view on the DataFrame, and it seems like a pretty useful one, so if could be slotted into pandas somewhere it would be a good addition.\n\nMy opinion is that the `df.plot(kind='bar')` plots work because it's pretty easy to understand what will be plotted just from the one-word keyword, I'm not sure if the same would be true for `kind='missing'`, since there's not necessarily a single standard way of visualizing missing values that everyone will recognize.\n\nSo I think it should go either:\n- In `pandas.tools.plotting`, with a name like `missing_values_map`\n- In the cookbook\n\nI'd go for having it in `pandas.tools.plotting`.\n"
