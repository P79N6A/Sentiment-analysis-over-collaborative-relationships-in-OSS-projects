    "body": "just so you are aware...if you push a new branch with the same name as your PR branch, that's what Github uses. So if you ran :\n\n``` sh\n# delete fixfred3 remotely\ngit push origin :fixfred3\ngit branch fixfred3 master\ngit checkout fixfred3\ngit push -u origin fixfred3\n```\n\nThen Github would pick up the change and use it for the PR. No magic involved. (though now it won't work because it's already been merged).\n"
