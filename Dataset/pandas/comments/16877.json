Nowhere does it say that it filters by a conditional, which is what you were aiming to do.\r\n\r\nTo perform the filtering that you want, one *recommended* way is this:\r\n\r\n~~~python\r\ndf = df[df.bcol <= 2]\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nNote that using `inplace=True` is generally not considered good practice because it makes code more prone to bugs (we will likely deprecate and remove this option at some point)."

The documentation looks pretty clear on this. #6189 demonstrates that clearly.  `True` and `False` are the labels `1` and `0` respectively, which is why it works the first time but fails the second time, so I don't think there is anything to fix here.  Also, you can't raise on a boolean indexer because you can have booleans as indices!"
