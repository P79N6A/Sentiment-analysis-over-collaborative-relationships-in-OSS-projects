    "body": "Well, first, \r\n```python\r\ndf2 += 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nis not the same as \r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf2.iloc[:, :] += 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe latter at least attempts to perform the operation on the underlying data, as I assume you expected, but this throws `SettingWithCopyWarning` noting that the behavior is undefined:\r\n```python\r\nIn [18]: df2.iloc[:, :] += 2\r\nC:\\Miniconda2\\Scripts\\ipython-script.py:1: SettingWithCopyWarning:\r\nA value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame\r\n\r\nSee the caveats in the documentation: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#indexing-view-versus-copy\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first is the same as writing\r\n```python\r\ndf2 = df2 + 2\r\n```\r\nwhich you will note changes the result of df2._is_view from `True` to `False` since you are assigning a new DataFrame object to the original variable.\r\n\r\nAs for the terminology it does get confusing but in general if `is_copy` is non-None then the result _might_  be a view. In part for this reason is_copy is already deprecated as of 0.23.4 (running your code throws FutureWarning as soon as you ask for is_copy)."
