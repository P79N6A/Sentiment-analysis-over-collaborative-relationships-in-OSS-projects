Is there interest for that @TomAugspurger\n> <https://github.com/TomAugspurger> ?\n>\n> The signature of barh in pandas is quite confusing to me\n>\n> In my mind, the x/y handling in barh makes sense as I see barh as a\n> flipped version of bar: the x-axis is drawn vertically and y-axis is\n> drawn horizontally. During data exploration, I usually switch between bar\n> and barh functions names to improve readability of the labels, and in\n> that process I don't want to also change the arguments of those functions.\n> That being said, I think the axis handling of barh is probably another\n> discussion and out of scope of this ticket.\n>\n> For completeness I also tried it out with pie, but there the x argument\n> seems to be ignored completely, so it kind of works with both 0.22 and\n> 0.23. However, the pie piece labels come from the index instead of the\n> given x column. But that is probably another (known) issue.\n> [image: screen shot 2018-06-13 at 10 49 45]\n> <https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44946/41340518-e0ed1c4c-6ef7-11e8-9b93-ed97ea6b3bca.png>\n>\n> —\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/21386#issuecomment-396870226>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABQHInXYqoecXRFXxguCDPJM7pyzrFWgks5t8NdogaJpZM4UgdDm>\n> .\n>\n"
