    "body": "Thanks for the report. I *think* you're right that fontsize should apply to all the ticklabels.\r\nInterested in submitting a fix? The problem is roughly around [here](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/0fe491db358204544814aa2371fed4ea947532ab/pandas/tools/plotting.py#L2771). I don't think the fontsize should be set there. We should follow up with something like\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif kwds.get('fontsize') is not None:\r\n    ax.tick_params(axis='both', labelsize=fontsize)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot great that pandas is using fontsize, when it should be called labelsize, but oh well.\r\n\r\nAnd as you noticed, the `.plot.box()` output isn't the same as `.boxplot` yet (backwards compatibility things)."
