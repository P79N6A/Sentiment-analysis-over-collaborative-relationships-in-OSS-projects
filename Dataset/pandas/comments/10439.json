    "body": "ATM, Period doesn't have ANY pickle support so not really sure what it is doing.\n\npull-requests are welcome! (basically need to add `__reduce__/__setstate__`), see for example `pandas/tslib.pyx/Timestamp` on how to do it.\n\nAlso not tested. `PeriodIndex` has support for this, but I don't think tested either.\n"
