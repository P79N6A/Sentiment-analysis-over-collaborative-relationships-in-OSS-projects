    "body": "Yes, I don't think the documentation addition really solved this issue. \r\n\r\nThe `max_colwidth` option is used by the DataFrameFormatter.to_string without being able to change it. At least we could add a keyword to be able to override it without needing to change the display settings. \r\nBut if you look at another option like `display.max_rows` or `max_columns`, those are ignored by `to_string`. So it even makes sense to ignore max_colwidth as well I think (anyhow, to be able to ignore the option, it will have to be added as a keyword anyhow, so the output formatting code can pass the correct setting)."

    "body": "I can hardly see how the coupling of the display limit with any other processing helps in solving this benign scenario. And not really how padding the strings which I notice takes place as well, helps, outside the display scenario. If there's too much history behind it, would you recommend using the plain csv package of python, for reading strings without modifying them?\r\n\r\nHere's a naive code sample, if it helps anyone ―\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport csv\r\nmessages = []\r\nwith open(\"csv-file\") as csvfile:\r\n    reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile, delimiter=',', quotechar='\"')\r\n    for row in reader:\r\n        messages.append(row['message'])\r\nmessages\r\n\r\nmessages_df = pd.DataFrame(messages, columns=['message'])\r\n\r\n# then concat to your main DataFrame...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems to avoid the truncation (but not the padding, which hurts a little with right-to-left text, as it pads as if the text is left-to-right, which kind of skews the semantics of the text more in the case of right-to-left text)"
