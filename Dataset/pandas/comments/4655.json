    "body": "Thanks for the ping. I've seen this before, it's fairly rare, due to a hash prefix collision.\nThat code was a kludge to accommodate vbench's use of abbreviated hashes internally.\nLooking at the code again, those come from `git log  --pretty=format:%h` which indeed\ncorresponds to the \"short\" hash employed here, rather then to simply truncating. \n\ncherry picked to master as d53e4fd. Thanks @wuan.\n"
