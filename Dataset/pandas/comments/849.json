    "body": "Hi,\n\nIs there a particular reason why this issue was closed?\n\nI've implemented most of the `expanding_` functions by simply calling the analogous `rolling_` function with `window=len(arg)` and `min_periods` defaulting to the minimum necessary to compute the statistic (`1` for most, `4` for kurtosis, etc.). The only potentially surprising output I've run into is that `NaN`s are ignored after the first `min_periods` while the NumPy equivalents (like `cummax`) occasionally preserve them.\n\nI'll submit a pull request if this seems like a reasonable solution.\n"
