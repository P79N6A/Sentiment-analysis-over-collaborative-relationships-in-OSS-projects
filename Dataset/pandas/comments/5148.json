This integer code is used by `tslib.period_ordinal` to convert the date to an ordinal. Unfortunately, `get_period_ordinal` is in cython which makes working with it difficult. What do you think of having some way of checking the `DateOffset` for an instance method \"`get_period_ordinal`\" before calling to cython? That way new `DateOffset` that want to handle their own conversion to periods can do so on the python class rather than having to add a new \"period code\" and then to add cython code?\n\nThe issue what I am trying to solve is taking data collected in 52-53 week fiscal years and up sampling to weeks. By design this should be a very clean upsampling (the quarters/years always end on the same day of the week).\n"

I have filed #6264 to fix this.\n"
