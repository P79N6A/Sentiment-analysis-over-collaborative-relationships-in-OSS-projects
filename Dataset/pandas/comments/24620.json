    "body": "Looks like it's because of this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            if not self.index.equals(other.index):\r\n                join_index, ilidx, iridx = self.index.join(\r\n                    other.index, how=join, level=level, return_indexers=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suppose the idea is that if `self` and `other` have the same index then no join needs to be done to align the two.  Is this then normal behavior?  Is it worth pointing out in the documentation that a join only happens if the indexes differ?  Or is this such an edge case it isn't worth mentioning (particularly since it only matters when we have duplicates)?"
