    "body": "Hi, sorry I've been off the case for ages, I've been really busy at work.  I thought about what could be useful, and it seems to me that the simplest thing would be that if an object in a DataFrame offers an HTML representation (i.e. implements `_repr_html_`), then that should be used by default (instead of the output from prettyprint, which I think is used at the moment) - this may be a slightly different use case to the original pull request however.  I put an example in a [gist](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/richlewis42/b806185b847096498318).  I couldn't make the change in `pandas.core.format` easily, as the representation is generated, then gets escaped by default - there would need to be some handling to make sure html provided by the object isn't escaped, but strings generated from the object is.  Any opinions on this?\n"

    "body": "I would vote for both: if a custom formatter is provided, then use that, otherwise if a `_repr_html_` exists, use that, otherwise use `repr` or `str` or whatever.  \n\nThe advantage of the custom formatter is that it gives you a lot of control: \n- if the elements are images, then you could resize them, or add a caption giving their dimensions etc.  \n- if the elements can be treated as keys into a map, e.g. the string `\"br\"` could be treated as a key into a map of flag images, you could then render the flag with the caption \"br\"...I think this is what @richlewis42  meant in the first comment.\n- if the elements are large data structures (e.g. numpy arrays, trees, dictionaries etc.) there may not be a single obvious `_repr_html_` for the given class, but there may be a sensible way of showing the specific data in your column.\n\nOf course one approach would be to wrap each of the objects in the column in a custom object which handles the `_repr_html_` call, but that would be a pretty ugly solution... the custom `formatters` suggestion is not really much more complicated than finding and using the `_repr_html_`.\n"

    "body": "This PR needs a bit of extra work to go in -- notably it needs some tests and slightly better docs. I'll add comments inline in the code.\n\n@richlewis42 I haven't taken a look at the code carefully yet, so up to you on the best order to add this. This PR is also probably going to make it in shortly and might help a title bit (see the `notebook` argument): https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/10232\n\nEdit: to clarify, I do think it's probably a good idea to add `_repr_html_` later, unless @d1manson wants to add it to this PR. The main work here will probably be documentation, not the actual code changes.\n"
