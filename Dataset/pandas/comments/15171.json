    "body": "``Decimal`` in general are not very well supported as a dtype; they are purely ``object`` dtype, and thus pretty second-class. This would take some effort to even support inference at display time.  So if you want to propose a patch, by all means, but in this would take a champion to provide anything more than trivial support.\r\n\r\nFurthermore ``Decimal`` is completely non-performant, so generally using this is not recommeded. I get that there are *some* cases where this is necessary, so as I say, patches are welcome."
