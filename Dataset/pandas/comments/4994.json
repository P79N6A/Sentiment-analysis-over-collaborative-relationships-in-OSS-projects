But if this function is actually internal (i.e., everything that calls it is _supposed_ to check that the arguments are correct), then asserts make sense because they're doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing: checking that the internal logic is what you expect. (and if they ever bubble up to the user, that's an error in programming). Thus, it's okay if they are removed with `python -O` because they should _not_ be necessary for effective running of the program.\n\nMoreover, any exception that this could raise wouldn't make sense to the user. What the heck does it mean to have this wrong start or stop or ndim or indexer? The caller needs to raise a more useful error to the user.\n"

    "body": "@dalejung last comment on this from me: the reason that all the asserts were changed to `raise AssertionError` is because we weren't clear which were \"internal\" asserts (i.e., all callers check that the input is correct) vs. errors validating user input (which need to stay in regardless). Anything that validates user input will _eventually_ be changed to a different kind of error because AssertionError is the wrong type. Those that still remain we still haven't gotten to yet.  `AssertionError`s that have a `# pragma: no cover` with them could be changed to asserts because it it (should be) impossible to get to that state from the public API.\n"

From the original comment about it on #4874:\n\n> It's just a small util I've been using when generating tests, but _I'm not sure if it should go into pandas_ and if so where.\n\nI actually use it external to pandas core development. It came out of a private repo. So it's only quasi-internal. Personally, I use a lot of \"internal\" functions from `pandas` like the low level binning. And outside of me, who's to say other people might not use a _convenience_ function in their own libs. \n\nI'll update the exceptions.\n"
