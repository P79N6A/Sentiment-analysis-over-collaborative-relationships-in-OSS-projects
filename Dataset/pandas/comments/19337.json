    "body": "@joosthvanderlinden thanks a lot for the report!\r\n\r\nI confirm that those indeed raise an error, and I went back to pandas 0.14 and there is was still failing (I expected it would have worked at a certain moment in an older release of pandas, as the examples seem like copy pasted from actual run code).\r\n\r\nThe main 'problem' in this case is that also the key column 'A' is present in the dataframe passed to the lambda function, and this fails on the numerical operations."
