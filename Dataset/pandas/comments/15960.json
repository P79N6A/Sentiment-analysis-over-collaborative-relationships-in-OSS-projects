    "body": "@pepicello Thanks for the report. You are correct it is not the best error message, although it indicates that the method does not defined. The doc page should better reflect that (PR welcome to update that!).\r\n\r\nNote that Panels will be deprecated (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/13563, merged in master, will be in the upcoming 0.20 releases), so we probably are not going to expand its functionality."

    "body": "Thanks @jorisvandenbossche, I have created a very simple PR, which should do in the meantime while the Panel still exists in the codebase. I tried to imitate the behaviour for similar methods. Shame to see the Panel going, but I agree that it is better to focus on perfecting the 1D and 2D versions. "
