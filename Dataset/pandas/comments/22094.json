    "body": "@jreback I did see your comment, which read:\r\n\r\n> there is a burden to maintain apis and code why should this be any different from other ‘highly used code’\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `from_items()` a simple wrapper around `from_dict()`, which surely imposes less burden than repeatedly answering questions from people whose code using `from_items()` now causes warnings (and soon, failures).  You might be under the impression that everyone can just replace `from_items(x, ...)` with `from_dict(OrderedDict(x), ...)`, but as this PR shows it is not quite so simple.  In fact there are three different \"modes\", one of which actually produces the wrong result if used without my wrapper (due to #8425).\r\n\r\nI realize that you strongly prefer to eliminate code.  This PR reduces code relative to 0.22 and even more so when compared with master.  It adds a small amount of simple code relative to your preferred end state, but the benefit is that it allows thousands of existing applications and notebooks to continue working.\r\n\r\n@jorisvandenbossche @gfyoung @chris-b1 @reidy-p @wesm I do not agree with the closure of this PR without a substantive discussion.  I do not know whether Pandas is unilaterally ruled by one person, but I would appreciate your consideration of this PR to avoid breaking a large number of programs.  I believe Pandas has a long future ahead, but this API brinksmanship erodes confidence."
