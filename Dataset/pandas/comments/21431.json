    "body": "I'm not sure about disallowing `nrows=0`.  It's generally useful when you need to dynamically read a subset of columns, where you do a two pass procedure along the lines of:\r\n\r\n1. Read in the columns only, e.g. `all_cols = pd.read_csv('file.csv', nrows=0).columns`\r\n2. Dynamically filter the columns, e.g. `good_cols = [c for c in all_cols if c.startswith('foo')]`\r\n3. Read in only the desired columns, e.g. `df = pd.read_csv('file.csv', usecols=good_cols)`\r\n\r\nI doubt you lose much performance by using `nrows=1` instead, so it's not the end of the world if this does get removed.  However, there are some established StackOverflow answers with `nrows=0` similar to my procedure above, so I imagine there are some users that have `nrows=0` in their codebase.  If this is going to be removed, it definitely seems like it should be deprecated first."
