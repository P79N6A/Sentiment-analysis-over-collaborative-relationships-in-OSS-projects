    "body": "My initial guess would be that since we're explicitly requesting an `int` dtype we should get that as the type of the resulting `Series`, and maybe make a special case for `npn.nan` so it doesn't fail when it can't be casted?\r\n\r\nHowever this is not any of those two behaviors, so if we want to go with one of those two I would go to falling back to what happens when `data` is an array."
