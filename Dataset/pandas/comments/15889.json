Not necessarily 32 bit, but that might be the consequence (I don't know what version of ARM is most widely used, I understand the latest ARM also supports 64bit).\r\n\r\nAlso, it is maybe good to discuss where exactly the burden is: is it difficult to support in the actual code, or are it more the tests that are failing due to some reasons (int32 vs int64, precision, ..) without necessarily giving incorrect results? Are there ways to improve the situation around testing? Or is it the packaging? (but if that is the case, we can also drop binaries for it without dropping full support (like conda-forge did))\r\n\r\nIf it is mainly the testing that is the problem (tests easily break if we don't run tests on 32 bit regularly), we could also say that \"we don't guarantee that the tests pass on 32 bit, but happily receive patches to get them passing\" instead of \"we don't support 32 bit\". \r\nIn practice this might be more or less the same for us (we don't test / package for 32-bit), but it's a very different message to outside users / developers."

    "body": "> For example for ARM, Raspberry Pi and the like or WebAssembly\r\n\r\nYes, if pandas explicitly drop supports (as in stops accepting patches for non x86-64 arch, or makes refactoring breaking existing support) it might become difficult to run pandas there cc @mdboom \r\n\r\n> 32-bit support has a very small number of downloads now\r\n\r\nI guess you were talking about Windows, but note that for most Linux based exotic arch, people would likely use the packages built for debian / some other distribution (or rebuild from sources). In scikit-learn the debian release CI is how we mostly discover issues on these platforms.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the spectrum, there is e.g. PowerPC64 arch  used in [IBM Blue Gene Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Blue_Gene#Blue_Gene/Q) supercomputers. It is 64 bit, but big endian, which is also not tested in CI. It might not be officially supported, but I guess pandas probably mostly works there. Packaging would be done as part of RHEL.\r\n\r\n> Further question: what are other packages doing? (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, sklearn, ...)\r\n\r\nNumpy runs CI for ARM (64 bit I think) with Shippable, and from what I understood there might be some interest in also doing that for scikit-learn.\r\n\r\n> Moreover, my very general and superficial analysis of issues like #24613 [..] is that they actually help us fix mistakes in the code, regardless of the use of 32 bits.\r\n\r\nI had the same experience in other projects.\r\n\r\nOverall CPython is very portable and it would be nice if the the main data analysis library in Python could also be run on most arch as is currently the case. I understand that this adds some maintance effort.\r\n\r\nMaybe a situation where motivated people in the community report issues and provide patches for those architectures, so that such arch are not officially supported but in practice mostly work (i.e. the test suite is not guaranteed to fully pass) could be good enough?"
