    "body": "I've traced this bug to the type of index we have on the columns of the pivoted table. The pivoted table is first constructed here:\n\nhttps://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/tools/pivot.py#L100\n\nIf the rows and columns account for the entire frame, then the index is a single level index. Otherwise, it's multilevel with nlevels=2. This difference causes problems later when we group by column:\n\nhttps://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/tools/pivot.py#L156\n\nRather than grouping by level 0 of a multi-index, we are grouping by the only level in a single index. This picks up a particular value in a column rather than the level 0 value in the index, which was the name of a column.\n\nI'll try to push a fix tomorrow or the next day pending time to work on it. We may need to handle this case specially.\n"
