    "body": "The SAS7BDAT file specification is not public, so we have no idea what\nissues might come up down the line.  The problems I am aware of are due to\nsome very minor differences in the headers, which encode meta-data about\nthe file and the machine used to generate the file.  We have fixed these in\na branch that should become part of 0.18.1.\n\nWe are also working on improving performance and hope to have a much faster\nversion of this ready soon.\n\nOn Thu, Mar 31, 2016 at 12:48 PM, itzybitzy notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Thanks @kshedden https://github.com/kshedden.
