    "body": "I understand your point. To be clear, right now `reindex_axis` is written such that it always returns an object. So `inplace` would actually be new functionality (i.e. keeping data with the original object reference).  Also, when `copy=False`, there's no guarantee that a copy isn't made, `copy` means \"force copy\" here.\n\nFrom the docs on `reindex_axis`:\n\n> **copy** : boolean, default True\n>        Return a new object, even if the passed indexes are the same\n\n`sort_index` always makes a copy of the underlying data.\n"
