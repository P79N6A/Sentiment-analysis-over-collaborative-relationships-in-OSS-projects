    "body": "Why does this depend on when the rc gets cut? (when I mentioned it, I was referring to whether I would have time to do it before the rc gets cut) \r\n\r\nHow can we change the behaviour and deprecate in one PR? You mean just changing the behaviour without warning? Which is actually certainly an option, as this prevents having to do the deprecation in two steps (first behaviour, then keyword), and I don't think this is that much used, so I am OK with just a back incompat breaking change."
