Numpy implicitly treats a list of arrays as a 2D array:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> arr = np.random.randint(0, 10, size=(3, 4))\r\n>>> L = [np.random.randint(0, 10, 4) for i in range(3)]\r\n>>> arr + L\r\narray([[ 9,  6,  6, 10],\r\n       [ 7, 13,  5,  5],\r\n       [ 7, 15, 17,  3]])\r\n```\r\n\r\n2D object + 2D object = 2D object\r\n\r\nPandas, on the other hand, treats a list of arrays as a 1D series of anonymous objects:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> df = pd.DataFrame(arr.T)\r\n>>> df + L\r\n               0              1                 2\r\n0  [9, 8, 8, 11]  [7, 15, 6, 9]      [7, 7, 9, 3]\r\n1   [7, 6, 6, 9]  [5, 13, 4, 7]  [15, 15, 17, 11]\r\n2   [7, 6, 6, 9]  [6, 14, 5, 8]  [15, 15, 17, 11]\r\n3  [8, 7, 7, 10]  [3, 11, 2, 5]      [7, 7, 9, 3]\r\n```\r\n\r\nEffectively, the result is 2D object + 2D object = 3D object. I found that to be quite surprising, due to the inconsistency with NumPy's behavior.\r\n\r\nThe result is even more silly if you try to add a list of series to a dataframe:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> L = [pd.Series(row) for row in L]\r\n>>> df + L\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is a 2D dataframe, each element of which is a 1D Series, and I can't imagine a scenario in which that is what the user would want.\r\n\r\nSince adding a list of numbers to a dataframe is basically equivalent to doing ``df[i] + L[i]`` within each column, I had expected that adding a list of Series objects to a dataframe would also be the equivalent of doing ``df[i] + L[i]`` for each column, in analogy to the way that NumPy broadcasting works (modulo the standard column-first vs. row-first difference).\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense why a user might be surprised by this behavior?"
