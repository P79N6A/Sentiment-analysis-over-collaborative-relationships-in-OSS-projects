    "body": "Well, I tried to fix the problem but I am afraid I have to give up.\n\nFirst of all, this is pretty hard to debug as I can't reproduce the problem in pycharm, only in the command line interpreter. By increasing the verbosity of the nose test runner `pd.test(verbose=4)` -  [This line](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/util/nosetester.py#L168) needs to be modified to allow this - I came to the conclusion that the problem was coming from nose itself, most likely in [nose/importer.py](https://github.com/nose-devs/nose/blob/master/nose/importer.py). This file uses `__file__` and `__path__` extensively and must be affected by the absolute/relative path problem.\n\nUnfortunately I haven't managed to track the bug down fully. If someone has experience with nose and module imports they will probably figure this out!\n"
