    "body": "I just upgrade from Pandas 0.22 to 0.24, and my code is breaking. What's happening in my code appears related to this issue.\r\n\r\nI have a worksheet in Excel with three tables in it. Those three tables have the same columns.\r\n\r\nIn version 0.22.0 of pandas, I could read all three of those tables into python with three read_excel statements, using the usecols argument to specify which part of the spreadsheet I wanted to read in.\r\n\r\nIn version 0.24.1 of pandas, the presence of duplicate column names in a part of the spreadsheet _that I'm not reading into Python_ forces the column names in the imported dataframe to have \".1\" suffixes appended to them. \r\n\r\nI can adjust my code to rename the columns after import, of course, but that's ugly. Was this an intentional change to the read_excel function that hasn't been documented? Or is this a bug?"
