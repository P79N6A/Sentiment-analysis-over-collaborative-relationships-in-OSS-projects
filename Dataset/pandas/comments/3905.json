Since slicing a datetimeindex is never 'integer' based, I think it is appropraite to always include endpoints.\n\nThough a case could be made for the reverse if a frequency is defined.\n\nWhat do you think?\n"

Given that, if you ask for all dates **less than or equal to** `04-Jan-2014 00:00` you would _not_ expect to get `04-Jan-2014 09:00`.\n\nPerhaps the misunderstanding is that I'm interpreting the string `'04-Jan-2014'` to mean the instant in time `pd.datetime(2014, 1, 4, 0, 0, 0)` (which I'd argue is the correct interpretation)?\n"

It holds in Excel, dateutil, numpy and even in the rest of pandas:\n\n``` python\nIn [1]: from dateutil.parser import parser\n\nIn [2]: parser().parse('04-Jan-2014')\nOut[2]: datetime.datetime(2014, 1, 4, 0, 0)\n\nIn [3]: np.datetime64('2014-01-04').astype(pd.datetime)\nOut[3]: datetime.date(2014, 1, 4)\n\nIn [4]: pd.DatetimeIndex(['01-Jan-2014'])[0]\nOut[4]: <Timestamp: 2014-01-01 00:00:00>\n```\n\nLooking at #3546 I can see the logic - it's handy to be able to get a whole period out without having to explicitly specify the start and end points of the slice e.g. `series['2014']`.\n\nI'm not sure that this utility extends to slices though - it seems _extremely_ surprising and far too magical to me to have a date string in a slice interpreted as anything other than a datetime instance as would be parsed by pandas itself in other circumstances.\n\nI'll post a link on the mailing list to solicit other feedback as it could be that I'm in the minority by being surprised by the current behaviour. If so it may still be worthwhile to have a note in the documentation.\n"

    "body": "Sorry, I'm mostly offline for the next week and haven't had a chance to really look at it properly.\n\nMy interpretation of the current behaviour is that slicing with date strings works _differently_ to slicing with date objects. When slicing with date strings the both the start and end dates are treated as period objects whose frequency is determined by the \"accuracy\" of the passed date object. e.g. if `2013-04` is passed in it is treated as a period with a monthly frequency whereas `2013-04-01` would be treated as a period with a daily frequency. \n\nTreating the slice arguments as periods has the important consequence that because the end point is inclusive all timestamps falling within the last period will be included in the slice. e.g. the slice `series['01-Apr-2013':'04-Apr-2013']` will include all values which occurred on `04-Apr-2013`, even one which occurred at `04-Apr-2013 23:59:59`\n"
