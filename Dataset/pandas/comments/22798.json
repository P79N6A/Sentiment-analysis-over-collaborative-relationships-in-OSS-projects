    "body": "This seems difficult for older numpys without `__array_ufunc__`. There are a few issues:\r\n\r\n1. `Series.__array__` is called before we have a chance to do anything. This must return an ndarray, which means we have to convert the Series[EA] to an ndarray, which may be wasteful / expensive.\r\n2. `__array_prepare__` has to return an ndarray. Ideally we would kind of \"break out of\" the ufunc on the series, and have the ufunc called on the EA instead, and wrap up that result.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I think working around these would be too difficult. Right now, I'll see if we can support numpy with `__array_ufunc__` and raise with a nice error message otherwise."
