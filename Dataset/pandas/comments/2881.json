There is a test needed for this, since my code change did not break a test.\n\nNow, how are the options `expand_frame=True`, `max_columns=0` and `pd.options.display.line_width` supposed to interact in the various scenario`s of line_width / terminal-width and repr-width?\nFor example line_width > terminal-width and  terminal-width < repr-width < line_width. Ok i know, it may seem silly to set line_width > terminal-width but it is possible to do so. Or do we disable multipage-view when max_columns=0. \n\nWhat about line_width=0, and use terminal width detection to set its value?\n"

    "body": "We are clearly not in line on this, no problem we will converge :-)\n\nThe place were you disagree on me using `line_width` is the scenario when the frame repr fits in the boundaries set by max_columns/max_rows. Even than it is still possible than an info repr is needed when expand_frame_repr=False and the frame repr exceeds line_width.  I find i strange that you want to check on terminal_width in this scenario and limit the repr width to line_width.  It could also be i completely misunderstand `line_width` / `expand_frame_repr`.\n\nIMO terminal_width and terminal_height should only be used when requested by the user (either by setting max_columns, max_rows to zero, maybe also for line_width=0). I see no need to overrule the result returned from get_terminal_size. Now this is done for the qtconsole, it seems you also want to add a detection/overruling if the notebook is used. Even with those two in place there are other scenarios when get_terminal_size will not give the expected result. Why not leave it up to the user if he/she wants to use it. In this branch terminal_width/terminal_size is only used when either max_columns or max_rows is set to zero (yes it can be cleaned up). This is user controlled and we probably need to document the limitations of doing so, but i would leave it up to the user to make an informed decision. For me there is no need for qtconsole/notebook detection/overruling.\n\nWe do need to handle interactive or not, since users complained about the repr info fallback when using pandas in non interactive mode, being it un-unix like. On master, not all repr info fallbacks are prevented, is that ok?\n\nYes, it was spaghetti and i made it even worse, that is for later let us first converge on the desired behavior.\n\nBy the way, df.to_string() has a `line_width issue` (also on master), when it falls back to a multi-page view, the line_width is not always respected, in the two examples below i expect width to be maxed on line_width=80.\n\n``` python\nIn [1]: import pandas as pd\n\nIn [2]: len(repr(pd.DataFrame(123456, range(5), range(15))).split('\\n')[1])\nOut[2]: 92\n\nIn [3]: pd.options.display.max_columns = 1000\n\nIn [4]: len(repr(pd.DataFrame(0, range(5), range(35))).split('\\n')[1])\nOut[4]: 104\n```\n"

    "body": "Yes i would include `line_width` also in the decision process of full/info/wide display. Not so much to handle qtconsole, or notebook.\n\nAnother point i am trying to make is that the output of get_terminal_size should only be used when either one of `max_columns`, `max_rows`, `line_width` is set to zero. And document the shortcoming of doing this. Such that it may result in unexpected results when a terminal is not used. I would not try to handle the imperfection of get_terminal_size (qt_console, notebook detection). There will be scenarios anyway we can not cover, like a gui with embedded python shell. BTW python3.3 standard library has its own [get_terminal_size](http://docs.python.org/release/3.3.0/library/shutil.html#shutil.get_terminal_size), with the same shortcomings we are facing. If none of `max_columns`, `max_rows`, `line_width` is set to zero `get_terminal_size` is not part of the game! And checks to decide if we have a wide frame are only done against `max_columns`, `max_rows` and `line_width`. How we handle a wide frame is determined by `expand_frame_repr`.\n\nFor me `max_columns/max_rows` is clear, but i can see your point that it may lead to confusion. We can maybe rework the option description to avoid this.\n"
