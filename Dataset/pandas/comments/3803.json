Suggestion for you too: you might try installing [guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) and then using this [Guardfile](https://gist.github.com/jtratner/5733131) that I wrote up for the pandas repo. This should, in general, automatically run tests as you change files (and I added a part so that it would automatically rebuild the docs if you make changes). That said, are you sure that you want the `doc` task to also call `develop`? That causes it to remove the build folder, rebuild all the extensions and then install it again into your site-packages. You might want to remove develop and keep it separate.\n"
