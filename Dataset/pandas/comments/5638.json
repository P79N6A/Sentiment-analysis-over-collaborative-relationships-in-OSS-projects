    "body": "Yes, I think broadcasting one error column to all of the data columns should be an option -- it should be doable by adding to the `_parse_errorbars` function.\n\nIt does prevent the user from being able to plot some data with error bars and some without. But in those cases, they can use the \"key-matched error DataFrame\" -- if a label is not present in that column, the data will be plotted without error bars. Overall, I like this method since it is most explicit and least prone to unintended consequences, I think.\n\nAnd yes, being able to pass an error dict is a good idea. I changed the code to implement this by taking advantage of the syntactic similarity of DataFrames and dicts (e.g. if you have `type(df)` is `DataFrame` and `type(d)` is `dict`, you can do `'x' in df.keys()` and `'x' in d.keys()` and `df['x']` and `d['x']`, and both will work. (although I don't know if this is considered good/safe coding practice, thoughts?).\n\nI decided not to include x errors for bar plot because I don't think I've ever seen one with x errors, but you're probably right that they should be included. (I hadn't considered barh, and also, who am I to say you shouldn't have x error bars on vertical bar plots?)\n\nAs for asymmetrical error bars, I was thinking of implementing something like yerr_upper/yerr_lower since then you could organize it using error DataFrames/dicts like before, but it gets a bit messy. I'll give the method you suggested a shot -- thanks for your help!\n"

    "body": "Sorry it took so long to get back to this; it fell of my radar. Most of my comments are inline.\n\nI need a bit longer to look at your changes to `get_plot_function.`\n\nAlso there's a lot of repeated code. There are blocks that do something for `yerr` and then do something for `xerr`. See if you can factor those into their own function or closure.\n\nSame thing for `_parser_error_bars` and `parse_error_bars_for_sereis`. It would be better to do as much of that in one place as possible. I haven't had a close look yet, but I'll see if there's a way to reduce the repetition.\n\nThanks for doing this. It's a pretty tricky API to work out, but I think it looks pretty good so far.\n"

    "body": "Thanks for the comments so far. I think it's possible to do away with `_parse_errorbars_for_series`. I had been using it when calling `plot_series`, but all of the use cases can be dealt with in the `_parse_errorbars` call that takes place in the `_make_plot` function.\n\nOne case where it is still useful is a pretty specific case: calling `df.plot()` (uses `plot_frame`), and specifying both the y-data and yerr/xerr data with strings (or ints) indicating columns from that DataFrame (`y` and `yerr` keyword arguments). The problem is that only the y-data column is passed onto the resulting `plot_series` call, the rest of the DataFrame does not make it through, so downstream code does not have access to the error column(s). So either the error columns need to be broken out of the DataFrame before the call to `plot_series` (that's what `_parse_errorbars_for_series` was doing, but it could be done without farming out to a special function), or I might have to make some more drastic changes to the code. Or this functionality could be abandoned, the user would just have to say `yerr=df['the_err_column']` instead of `yerr='the_err_column'`. Not too much to ask. At this point, I agree that `_parse_errorbars_for_series` should go, and we should find a workaround.\n\nI did manage to find a SublimeText plugin that highlights and removes trailing whitespace, thanks for pointing that out, I had no idea :)\n\nAlso, I did a rebase but I'm still a little weak on the git-fu, hopefully I didn't mangle it too badly.\n"

    "body": "I'm compiling a list of what should / shouldn't work as far as the types of `df` and `xerr`/`yerr` go. Let me know if I'm missing anything.\n\n# List of Supported APIs\n\n`self` is `df`, `other` is `*err`.\n1. `self` is a DataFrame\n   a. `*err` is a DataFrame with matching columns, values are widths\n   b. `*err` is a str, indicating a columin in `df`\n   c. `*err` is a dict, keys matching `df.columns`, values are widths\n   d. `*err` is a DataFrame with **partially columns**, Fails with `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'numpy.int64' and 'str'`\n   after plotting the errorbars / line for the one that does match. This should either raise or pass, plotting line + error bars for matches and just lines for the non-matchings.\n   e. `*err` is a DataFrame with **no matching columns**. Fails with\n   `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'numpy.int64' and 'str'`\n   f. `self` is an MxN DataFrame, other is an MxN array of values (unlabeled). Fails with `ValueError: In safezip, len(args[0])=3 but len(args[1])=2`. It's OK that this doesn't work. May want to catch (if possible) and report a better error.\n   h. `self` is an `MxN` DataFrame, other is an `NxM` array. Plots correctly.\n   g. `self` is an `MxN` DataFrame, other is an `Nx2xM` array. plots asymmetrical error bars.\n2. `self` is a Series\n   a. `*err` is a DataFrame, `self.name` is set, matches col in `other`, values are widths\n   b. `*err` is a DataFrame, `self.name` is set, doesn't match col in `other` (Type error (adding str + int) right now, should raise ValueError?)\n   c. `*err` is a DataFrame, `self.name` is None, same behavior is 2b.\n   d. `*err` is a Series with `other.name` set, `self.name` is None, the name on `other` is ignored (this is probably ok.)\n   e. `*err` is a Series with `other.name` set, `self.name` is set, _but dones't match `other.name`_. The names are ignored and it works (probably ok?)\n   f. `self.name` is set or not, `*err` is arraylike (works).\n   g. `self` is `M,` and `*err` is an `NxM` array. This plots, but I'm not sure what values. Just the first row of `*err?\n\n## Concerns\n- What to do about the other axis? What if only some of the index labels match (we should only use those).\n- When `self` is a Series, `other` is a DataFrame, and no columns match: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'numpy.int64' and 'str'\n- Differing lengths: raises `ValueError: In safezip, len(args[0])=3 but len(args[1])=2`. Catch earlier (style thing maybe?).\n- Maybe it would be better (easier to implement) to be strict about having names always match?\n- I would ignore asymmetrical error bars for now. That's a good enhancement for the future, but you probably want to get this merged first (I want it merged; doing error bars manually sucks). (EDIT: Looks like you support it already, I added cases 1h and 1g above).\n\nMy biggest concern is the first one, checking the index labels.\n\nI'm going to look into the code now.\n"
