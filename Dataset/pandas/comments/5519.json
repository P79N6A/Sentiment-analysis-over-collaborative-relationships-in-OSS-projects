    "body": "But maybe another question: why is there a `Series.weekday` method? Because it is the only date-time component that is available directly on the Series object. All the others (like hour, minute, year, date, ...) are only available for the index object. \nSo I would say: or all those methods should be made available as Series method, or we remove the Series.weekday method (or at least: don't document it if it can't be removed, or refer to DatetimeIndex.weekday). \nOr is there a good reason that Series.weekday is available?\n"

I'd probably prefer to do something like the following (and you can play around with or discard this if you like, I don't have time to put anything together right now). First, you'll probably want  the `optional_args` decorator that I wrote up (I think its in testing)  so it's less verbose:\n\n``` python\n@optional_args\ndef deprecated(f, future_version='a future version', alternative='', name=None):\n    if not compat.callable(f): # pragma: no cover\n        raise TypeError('Can only deprecate functions. Got %r' % f)\n    name = name or f.__name__ or ''\n    msg = '%(name) is deprecated and will be removed in %(future_version).' % dict(future_version=future_version, name=name)\n     if alternative:\n        msg += ' Use %r instead' % alternative\n\n    @functools.wraps(f)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        warnings.warn(msg) # might want to bump the stack level here\n        return f(*args, **kwargs)\n     wrapper.__doc__ = 'DEPRECATED: %s\\n%s' % (msg, wrapper.__doc__)\n     return wrapper\n```\n\nOtherwise I might have time to do this next week.\n"
