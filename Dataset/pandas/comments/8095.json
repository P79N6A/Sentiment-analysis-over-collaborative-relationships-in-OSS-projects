    "body": "@numenic\n\nThe pandas `writer.save()` method calls the `xlsxwriter` `workbook.close()` method which writes all the data to the xlsx file and closes it.\n\nCalling `save()` a second time doesn't have any effect since the file is already closed\n\nSo, you shouldn't call `save()` until you have finished writing data and are ready to close the file. If you structure your code that way then you can write multiple worksheets:\n\n``` python\n>>> import pandas as pd\n>>> df=pd.DataFrame({'a': [1,2,3], 'b':[4,5,6]})\n>>> writer = pd.ExcelWriter('try_xlsxwriter.xlsx')\n>>> df.to_excel(writer, 'sheet1')\n>>> df.to_excel(writer, 'sheet2')\n>>> writer.save()\n```\n\n![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/94267/4038644/4f570646-2cb9-11e4-981c-fc7d6db7839d.png)\n\nThe example probably works for `openpyxl` because that module can rewrite a file. Even so, that is probably inefficient.\n"
