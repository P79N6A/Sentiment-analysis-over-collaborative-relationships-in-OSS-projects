I have a bunch of multi-indexed df's being written to Excel in some analyses I'm doing, as far as I know they've all been working fine in v0.15.2. The misalignment described here only seems to happen when you set `index=False`, doesn't it? Removing that arg from OP's example code produces sensible output. \nI realize that reading of multi-index columns doesn't work so you can't roundtrip, but it seems like overkill to disable writes completely if it's only the `index=False` case that fails. \n"
