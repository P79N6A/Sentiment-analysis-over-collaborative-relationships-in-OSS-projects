When I searched for how to do this with a MultiIndex, the `query` method was the first answer I found. It worked great for splitting my data (DataFrame) but didn't work for splitting my labels (Series). Are you also proposing we drop `query` from DataFrames because the same thing _could_ be done through other methods?"
