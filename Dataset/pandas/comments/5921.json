    "body": "@y-p Yes, I am afraid you missed something. Can you revert the commit which removes autosummary template?\n\nThe template causes the error with Sphinx 1.2 as explained in #5899, but it is still useful. But maybe my wording there was not very clear. Sorry for that. When I said that removing the template solves the error, I didn't mean that the template _should be removed_ ... It was just to know the error has something to do with the template (to further investigate it) and for people who really want to build the docs with 1.2. \nThe function of the template is to automatically create docstring pages for all methods of DataFrame, Series etc (because not all of them are added manually to the api.rst page) so linking to them from the docs works and they can be found with google. See #5160 for details.\n"

As they should normally be able to install 1.1.3 manually if they are explained to do. We should then add a note about that in the guidelines to build the docs for now. What do you think?\n\nAnd if you think of other ways to obtain similar results, it would certainly also be good. I just copied the approach of numpy and scipy (they have also such a template class.rst, for this reason at the issue I pinged pv to ask if they have the same problem).\n"
