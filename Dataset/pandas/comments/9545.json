Not sure how I feel about an attribute with such a common name added to the dataframe which wasn't there in the ungrouped dataframe. Was a really hard bug to pinpoint. EDIT: the problem for me was that had a column named `\"name\"` and tried accessing it with the dot access syntactic sugar. Same would happen with `\"key\"`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25457"
