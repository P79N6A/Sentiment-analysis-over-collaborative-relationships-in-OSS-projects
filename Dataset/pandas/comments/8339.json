It would greatly increase complexity and possibly make the single-threaded case less performant, for IMHO very little gain. Multi-processing is much more useful, furthermore most intensive operations have inherent multi-threaded engines in any event, e.g. BLAS, and numexpr operations. \n\nYou should always always optimize performance LAST. I suspect if you profiled what you are doing you would find simple ways to speedup before moving on to a much more complex soln.\n"

    "body": "Thank you for quick feedback jreback!\n\nSo all of the operations on pandas containers have to be serialized always? Can I see the status of thread safety of different operations somewhere? \n\nYes of course I have profiled my production code and the threadpool is neccessary there. It produces massive speed increases (parallelized data download from internet). I can of course put mutexes over the pandas operations or try to do those operations on a single threaded context later in the program.\n"
