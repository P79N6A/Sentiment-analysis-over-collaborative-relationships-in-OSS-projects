The reason for dropping the option in the docs was because the implementation has only supported the first two options (the docs look like copy + paste at some point).\r\n\r\nTrue that there was no discussion to this, but a simple doc-change like #18559 went in without objections from anyone.  Everyone (including yourself) could have objected if need be, though to be fair, unless you're tracking `pandas` changes regularly, this would have been hard to catch.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that we haven't released this yet, so we do have time to implement a \"third\" option for `keep` if need be.  @jreback : what are your thoughts?"
