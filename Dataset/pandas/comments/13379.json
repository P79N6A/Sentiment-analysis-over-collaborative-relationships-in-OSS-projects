Would one Styler object both support to html and to latex, or would you rather have a Styler class for to html and a Styler class for to latex? (as the templates are different, many methods will have to add different syntax, ..)"

Do you think that, say, the syntax of ``Style.to_latex`` should be different from a mere combination of the syntax of ``Style.to_html`` and the syntax of ``DataFrame.to_latex``?\r\n\r\nIn particular, I never thought about having parameters in ``to_latex`` map to specific LaTeX formatting commands, because to my eyes not being able to transparently change the backend would defeat the purpose of supporting multiple backends. I rather see a set of supported formatting options which default to CSS ones (with, in the future, some additions if required), and other methods as a translation between CSS \"language\" and the desired format. Then CSS is huge, so each method would have in the docs a list of attributes it actually supports."
