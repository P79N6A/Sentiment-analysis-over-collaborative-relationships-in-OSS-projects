    "body": "This is somewhat related to #22773\r\n\r\nSo right now there's not a great API to do this. This is controlled internally by the `header_style` property of the ExcelFormatter class:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/683c7b55f5195fdf4f524239066cbf6f1301f0e7/pandas/io/formats/excel.py#L385\r\n\r\nThat's not part of the exposed API, nor is it an exposed attribute of the Styler object as that instantiates it locally:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/683c7b55f5195fdf4f524239066cbf6f1301f0e7/pandas/io/formats/style.py#L179\r\n\r\nSo one option is to figure out a way to logically expose that, though I'm not sure if that would really jive with the HTML elements that you are styling above.\r\n\r\nIn any case investigation and PRs would certainly be welcome"
