I think you are referring here to altering a list while iterating over it. this is def a different problem since the original dataframe is absolutely not modified by the .apply method.\r\n'This violates all kinds of guarantes.' Could you point to documentation or information about that? i don't see any type inference related matters in the doc for .apply. \r\nI understand this is an annoying burden to have to deal with this kind of requests for you, but then i would wonder why would you volunteer  for taking charge of the issues log if its for dismissing the problems out of hand like that?"
