    "body": "Actually, on further inspection, it seems the problem is creating a DataFrame from an empty Series that has been given a name, a Series constructed only from an empty dict can be used to construct a DataFrame. I guess the issue is something to do with constructing the list of column names in DataFrame, but I can successfully create a DataFrame from an empty dict and explicitly include some columns, and I get what I want, namely a DataFrame with no rows but with entries in the column index. It would be handy if I could get the same behaviour from my existing code, i.e. creating a DataFrame from an empty Series which has a name. \n\nThis isn't a major issue now though as I didn't realise that you can join a Series with a DataFrame, which is why I was converting my Series into DataFrame in the first place, and if you join a (populated) DataFrame with an empty Series with a name then pandas does exactly what I want in that it creates a column in the resulting DataFrame with NA entries for all the rows.\n\n``` python\nIn [19]: pandas.__version__\nOut[19]: '0.9.0'\n\nIn [20]: DataFrame(Series({})) # works\nOut[20]: \nEmpty DataFrame\nColumns: array([], dtype=int64)\nIndex: array([], dtype=object)\n\nIn [21]: DataFrame({}, columns = ['foo']) # works, and adds the 'foo' column\nOut[21]: \nEmpty DataFrame\nColumns: array([foo], dtype=object)\nIndex: array([], dtype=object)\n\nIn [31]: df = DataFrame({'foo': {'item1': 1, 'item2': 2}, 'bar': {'item2': 3}}) # create a populated df\n\nIn [32]: s = Series({},name = 'baz') # and an empty Series with a name\n\nIn [33]: df.join(s)\nOut[33]: \n       bar  foo  baz\nitem1  NaN    1  NaN\nitem2    3    2  NaN\n```\n"

    "body": "OK, I understand what's going on now. I can indeed create a DataFrame from an empty Series, but I have to do so by passing a dict with the name of the Series as the key and the Series as the corresponding value. Otherwise the Series is being interpreted as a numpy ndarray rather than a pandas Series object in the DataFrame constructor. This isn't a bug, so I'm going to close this issue. Thanks for reading anyway!\n\n``` python\nIn [56]: s = Series({}, name = 'foo')\n\nIn [57]: DataFrame({s.name: s})\nOut[57]: \nEmpty DataFrame\nColumns: array([foo], dtype=object)\nIndex: array([], dtype=object)\n```\n"
