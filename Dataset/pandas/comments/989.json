    "body": "This works:\n\n`np.dot(x[:, None], randn(1, 10))`\n\nBut this does not:\n\n`np.dot(x.reshape((-1, 1)), randn(1, 10))`\n\nThis is definitely a bug; guess I need to override reshape and return an array in the case of > 1D output.\n\nFrankly, I'm partially considering making Series not a subclass of ndarray for reasons like these. I'm fearful of all the code people have written like `isinstance(obj1d, np.ndarray)` that this would break, but otherwise as long as Series obeys the array interface ufuncs and all that will continue to work fine. This would allow me to push Series completely into Cython if I wanted. \n"

I've pretty much abandoned trying to use Series in any calculations that involve other data for this reason.\n\nOT: I've been playing with a factor class that subclasses Series and it also doesn't make sense as an array.\n"
