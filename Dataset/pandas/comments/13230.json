    "body": "yes it looks like it's correct now and was wrong before. I changed na_position to 'first' which solves the issue for me. I'd suggest to put it in the change-notes regarding backwards compatibility.\n\nSeems as if that was the last one, now all my stuff is running again. Thanks again for your help and especially the suggestions regarding the float storage with units instead of decimal.decimal I'll give that a try when I find the time as it could help a lot!\n\nI'd love to contribute more than these issue-reports but right now totally lack the time to do so. But I hope this changes in the future so that I'll be able to give some back to the pydata-community. Till then I'll keep on spreading the word about it. I mentioned your \"pandas for finance\" talk in a youtube video I did a few weeks ago (https://youtu.be/-0mmLkr420g?t=15m46s) and on twitter etc. Also should you ever be in Berlin, I'd be happy to have a beer or two with you!\n"
