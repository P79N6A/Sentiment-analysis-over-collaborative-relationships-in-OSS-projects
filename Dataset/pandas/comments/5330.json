(I would like to de-emphasize NaN cells.)\n\nMy idea was to add a class to empty cells:\n\n``` html\n<td class=\"pandas-nan\">\n```\n\nThen, one can use CSS for arbitrary styling.  (No, even CSS3 does not have selectors yet based on _content_ which would allow to select NaN-cells.)\n\nSince CSS allows many other types of conditional formatting already, I would say that this is a useful addition that does not interfere with other enhancement ideas (templates, ...)?!\n"
