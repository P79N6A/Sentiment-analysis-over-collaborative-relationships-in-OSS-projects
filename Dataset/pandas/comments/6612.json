    "body": "> your example looks fine to me\n> what is the bug?\n\nThe series has an index of integers counting down. `take` is advertised to operate on locations, not labels, hence when I do `take([2,1,0])`, the series is reversed and this is expected. \n\nNow, `reindex(..., takeable=True)` is advertised to \n\n```\ntakeable : boolean, default False\ntreat the passed as positional values\n```\n\nhence, I'd expect it to return the same reversed series as `take` did but in this particular case it does not.\n\nThis happens because there are (multiple) optimization shortcuts that check if `reindex` argument matches the actual index and if the reindexing can be avoided altogether. The problem is that those shortcuts don't consider `takeable` and thus may try to match labels with positions which happens in this case. With the values I've provided the check (wrongly) succeeds and returns the series as-is.\n"
