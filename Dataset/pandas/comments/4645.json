    "body": "Sorry for my silence, I was in Yellowstone completely offline! ;) I haven't used this functionality, what I am in general worried about is that knowledge of pytables becomes more and more a requirement for using pandas properly, at least for the hdf functionality. One could argue that data people need to deal with it in any case but I am loving pandas so much because it integrates many other python libraries seemlessly. In this case I wouldn't know what a 'storer' really is, apart from it's shown usage in the docs. Maybe my worries could be nullyfied by a helpful intro paragraph, unless that already exists and my 2 weeks absence made me miss it.\n"

The name 'storer' could be substituted by something more indicative of what it is as opposed to 'table' (that also is a storer in a wide sense), though admittedly that may involve mentioning some pytables|hdf5-specific lingo.\n\nNot yet landed home, just a first impression from a quick glance.
