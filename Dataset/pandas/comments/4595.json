    "body": "I wonder if it would be reasonable to try to convert dates automatically and leave as a string if that fails.\n\nIt also _might_ be reasonable to set `index_col=0` as the default similar to `header=0` although personally I like being forced to declare what I want as an index. For more complex code bases that use `pandas` I think this is more maintainable. For tutorials and other interactive analyses this may not be ideal.\n\nThese are both backwards incompatible API changes though, and over here we _really_ try hard to be backwards-compatible.\n\n@GregStG Also realize that with `pandas`'s flexibility it's hard to be everything to everyone. This means that some things, especially IO code, will not be invertible, i.e., `df.to_csv('csv.csv'); df2 = read_csv('csv.csv')`, `df2 != df`. \n\nThat said, we _do_ aim to please our users as much as possible.\n"

I am sorry not to have posted an example of what I meant.\n\nIn[5]: pd.**version**\nOut[5]: '0.12.0'\n\nIn[6]: all_data ={}\n\nIn[7]: for ticker in ['AAPL', 'IBM', 'MSFT', 'GOOG']:\n              all_data[ticker] = web.get_data_yahoo(ticker,\n'1/1/2013','8/1/2013')\n\nIn[8]: price = DataFrame({tic: data['Adj Close'] for tic, data in\nall_data.iteritems()})\n\nIn[9]: price.index[0:3]\nOut[9]:\n<class 'pandas.tseries.index.DatetimeIndex'>\n[2013-01-02 00:00:00, ..., 2013-01-04 00:00:00]\nLength: 3, Freq: None, Timezone: None\n\nIn[10]: price.to_csv('price2.csv')\n\nIn[11]: price2 = pd.read_csv('price2.csv')\n\nIn[12]: price2.index[0:3]\nOut[12]: Int64Index([0, 1, 2], dtype=int64)\n\nThis is a paste from Canopy, where I have entered the 'In' statements by\nhand.\n\nThis example is basically from p 139 of Wes McKinney's text.  The point is,\nif you create the price DataFrame\nand then spend several hours writing functions to filter it, they will\ninevitably use the index as it exists, and then\nwhen you come back the next day after saving your data base, your code will\nnot work.  This was my experience.\nActually, since i am far from from bright about these things, it actually\ntook me quite awhile to figure out what\nwas going on.  So I think it worth at least a 'note' somewhere.\n\nIt was pointed out, and I am grateful for this, that I should have used\ndf.save() and df.load().  If you use these\nfunctions the form of the dataframe will indeed be preserved (although I\ngot a deprecated notice when using\nload...).  My point then is perhaps that people reading Wes's book will all\nhave this experience.  In the chapter\n6 on Data Loading etc.  and previously, the functions used to save and read\ndataframes are the ones I have used.\nI couldn't find that df.load and df.save were even mentioned there, though\nI may well be wrong.  So maybe my\ncomment is more for Wes, but also maybe the issue is not worth bothering\nhim about, so I won't.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nGreg St. George\n\nOn Sun, Aug 18, 2013 at 10:10 AM, y-p notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> Both df.from_csv and pd.read_csv have parse_dates, with differing default\n> values. horrors.\n> Am still personally fine with df->csv->df mangling dataframes in this way.\n> \n> I would suggest just leaving things as they are. a doc note doesn't hurt\n> (and doesn't\n> help much either). if deprecate == remove, I think this is too small a\n> wart to justify\n> breaking existing code.\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/4595#issuecomment-22833501\n> .\n"
