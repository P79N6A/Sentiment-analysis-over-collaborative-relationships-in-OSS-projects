    "body": "Super that you wan't to work on this! Docs on these groupby things are really a gap in the documentation at the moment IMHO..\n\nI also have been thinking about it some time ago, and I think there are some issues to pay attention to:\n- Not all methods are implemented as methods from the `Groupby` class, also some in `DataFrameGroupby` and `SeriesGroupby` (eg aggregate) or `NDFrameGroupby`. This can make it complex to the user.\n- These methods appear as methods of the `GroupBy` (or other as `DataFrameGrouBy` etc) object. I think it has to be clearly stated that such an object is the result of a `df.groupby()` call and that these methods are applicable on that. Maybe some lines can be added to api.rst to explain that.\n- Another thing that makes it complicated, is that actually also other Series/DataFrame methods can be applied on a groupby method. Eg. the 'missing' doc on the `nunique` function as mentioned in #4500 is actually not really missing, as this is just a Series method (so adding these all to the docs is not really possible, but a better explanation of this in the narrative groupby docs can of course help a lot).\n\nBut it is certainly a good start!\n\nSomething else (but that is a broader discussion), the mentioning of `NDFrame` is also somewhat problematic I think, as nowhere in the docs it is really explained what this is (as far as I know?). But this is something that maybe needs some seperate discussion, as it also appears in other parts of the docs, certainly now more functions are made 'generic' and not seperately implemented for Series and DataFrame.\n"
