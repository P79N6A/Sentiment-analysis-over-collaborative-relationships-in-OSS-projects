    "body": "I thought `compression='gzip'` reads `.gz` files, but not `.zip`. If I understand your suggestion, you're saying just to incorporate the `z.open('some_file_name.csv')` into `pd.read_csv` to add a `compression='zip'` option. I'm fairly new to GitHub (and python), but I could give it a shot. \n\nI suppose this approach would require there to be only one file in the `.zip` archive, unless a new parameter were to be added to `pd.read_csv` that allowed the user to specify which file to read from the archive.\n"

    "body": "A zip file can contains many csv files, folders, and other files- and is closer to a file system with compression than a compressed file.  IMO it isn't practical to add support for zip files in any generic way.  The simplest way is for the user to pass a buffer-like object from the zip to read csv. \n\nOne could add the special case where a zip contains a single csv file in the root of the zip, but this is far from zip \"support\".\n"
