    "body": "I'm not sure what ambiguity you're referring to. If you mean that it's unclear whether `df[(\"a\", \"b\")]` should refer to the two columns of `df` with indices `\"a\"` and `\"b\"` or to the one column of `df` with index `(\"a\", \"b\")`, then pandas appears to have already decided that it refers to the latter, even when there is no column in `df` with index `(\"a\", \"b\")`.\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"a\":[1], \"b\":[2]})\r\ndf[(\"a\", \"b\")]\r\n```\r\nresults in \r\n```\r\nKeyError: ('a', 'b')\r\n```\r\n\r\nPandas also already has the MultiIndex concept which is roughly like using tuples to index dataframes, but but with some extra features on top (and some wonkiness when the tuples have different lengths). So the practice of indexing rows/columns with tuples is built into pandas in one form already, and I assume the syntax is already ironed out to be as unsurprising as possible.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, pandas is in principle fine with indices containing (immutable? hashable?) objects, you just end up with an `Index(..., dtype=object)` as the index of the dataframe. This would necessarily complicate some of the syntax if the objects are allowed to be lists (because pandas tries to work out whether you mean one column or several columns), but the case where they're tuples seems to be handled nicely already."
