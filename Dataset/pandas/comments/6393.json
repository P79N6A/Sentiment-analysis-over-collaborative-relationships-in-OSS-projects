    "body": "The issue is that the function actually reading the HTML from the page is doing something very different from what `requests.get(url).text` does. I'm going to close this, since the best we're going to be able to do is \n\n``` python\npd.read_html(requests.get(url).text)\n```\n\nbecause we can't really change the behavior of `urlopen`. It still works with a single line of code, which is pretty nice. `read_html` ideally would read directly from the URL, but reading the url via `requests` and then parsing the text is good enough.\n"
