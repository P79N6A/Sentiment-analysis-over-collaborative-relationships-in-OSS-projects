    "body": "My actual service consists of multiple processes, but I make sure they access different files, on the same host. The above test case did fail on a single process python session.\n\nHowever, I may have found the cause. I tried to repeat the test in a clean env installed with libhdf5-serial-dev (1.8.4) from standard ubuntu repo, and the test passed. However if I repeat in an env installed with the latest hdf5-1.8.13 downloaded from hdfgroup, the test did fail. \n\nIf 1.8.4 does work then I am happy to stick with it for now. but someone may want to check if there is compatibility issue among pandas/tables/hdf5-1.8.13, or it is simply an issue in hdf5 library itself. I am not very familiar with pyTables/hdf5 in order to further debug it, however let me know if you need further information.\n\nThanks!\n"
