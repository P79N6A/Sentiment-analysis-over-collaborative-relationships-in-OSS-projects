But, nonetheless, it _did_ work previously (with eg `df.convert_objects(convert_numeric=True, convert_dates='coerce')`, see my example above).  \n  I was thinking: would it be better to just pass this through, so you get an error instead of a warning?  \n  it seems reasonable to me to ensure that if someone did this before with the old style, this keeps working (his/her code does not break, the example I give above does not work now on master, and also not yet with this PR I think), but this is not possible with the new logic?\n- Maybe we should also add a note in the docstring of `convert_objects` that if multiple conversions are done at the same time, this happens with a particular order? And also, that this is not allowed when using `coerce=True` (you get an error for that, but it is not mentioned in the docstring)\n\nFurther, the default was previously to do date conversions. Now it is stated in the docs that the default is changed to do nothing. However, if I try on master, it seems that by default it does do numeric conversions:\n\n```\nIn [29]: pd.__version__\nOut[29]: '0.16.2+220.ga677217'\n\nIn [30]: df = pd.DataFrame({'a':[1.0, '2.3'], 'b':['1', \"4\"], 'c':['a', pd.Times\ntamp('2012-01-01') ]})\n\nIn [31]: df.dtypes\nOut[31]:\na    object\nb    object\nc    object\ndtype: object\n\nIn [32]: df.convert_objects()\nOut[32]:\n     a  b                    c\n0  1.0  1                    a\n1  2.3  4  2012-01-01 00:00:00\n\nIn [33]: df.convert_objects().dtypes\nOut[33]:\na    float64\nb      int64\nc     object\ndtype: object\n\nIn [34]: df.convert_objects(numeric=False).dtypes\nOut[34]:\na    float64\nb      int64\nc     object\ndtype: object\n```\n\nSo it seems that the `numeric` keyword has no effect.\n"

    "body": "@jorisvandenbossche The purpose of `.convert_objects` is conversion. whether it be `soft` or `force`.  Yes it defaulted to convert datetimes (but only in a trivial case when it was `object` dtyped but was actually an array of `Timestamps`). So calling it will do _some_ conversions (like above its a soft numeric conversion).\n\nSo this should not generally be necessary from a callers perspective for datetimes/timedeltas as we already have a well-defined way of doing this (e.g. `to_datetime/to_timedelta`). (though it IS used internally). \n\nHow about adding a `to_numeric` analagously? and making `.convert_objects` private. These are _kind_ of like `.astype` but more general.\n\nDownside is you cannot then say to pandas \"just figure this out\", by doing `.convert_objects(datetime=True, timedelta=True, numeric=True)`. (which IMHO is kind of dumb anyhow though).\n"

    "body": "> ok so their was an old bug which you fixed, but what are we missing with the new one that is necessary for back-compat? can you give an exmple\n\nThe version currently in master has a different signature.  In particular, `coerce` is now a `bool`.  Previously coercing was done using arguments like `convert_numeric='coerce'`.  This was done mostly to make it clear that one can only coerce one type.   For example, you can run\n\n```\ndf = pd.DataFrame([pd.NaT, '1.', dt.datetime(2015,1,1)]\ndf.convert_objects(convert_dates='coerce', convert_numeric='coerce'\n```\n\nwhich always struck me an horribly ambiguous as to what you get - the returned type depends on the order of the code in the function, which seems like a fragile (\"magic\") design.\n\nThis can't happen with the new one since \n\n```\ndf = pd.DataFrame([pd.NaT, '1.', dt.datetime(2015,1,1)]\ndf.convert_objects(datetimes=True, numeric=True, coerce=True)\n```\n\nwill raise since this is ambiguous.\n\nI suppose there are a few different options:\n1. Restore to the 0.16.2 version, plus fix the bug\n2. Option 1 plus check for ambiguous calls\n3. Option 2 plus keep new keyword argument names\n4. Go forward with a fundamentally different signature, which is in master\n\nThere is one final issue with `covert_objects`, which is what started me down this path, which is what to do about `convert_numeric='coerce'` which does not actually coerce if there are no numeric types.\n"
