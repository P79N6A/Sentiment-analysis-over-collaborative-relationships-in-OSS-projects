    "body": "This was a deliberate API change in 0.7.0, from the release notes\n\n```\n  - The default delimiter for ``read_csv`` is comma rather than letting\n    ``csv.Sniffer`` infer it\n```\n\nThe `Sniffer` class was actually inferring the wrong separator in some very often-occurring use cases. And most people expect `sep=','` to be the default for `read_csv` anyway. If you pass `sep=None` it will use the separator inference logic. Note that `read_table` uses `\\t` as its default separator\n"
