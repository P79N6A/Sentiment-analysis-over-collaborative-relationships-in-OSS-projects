The date format you are using (\"dd/mm/yy\") is not an international standard format (but a European one), and the default of the parser is to try to parse such dates as \"mm/dd/yy\" (more an American format I think). However, if this gives an error, it will try the other format. This is the reason you get inconsistent results between the rows in the csv.\n\nYou can pass `dayfirst=True` to `to_datetime`, and then the preference will be given to \"dd/mm/yy\" instead of to \"mm/dd/yy\".\n\nTypically you can also use `format=\"%d/%m/%y\"`, however (as you note) this will not work with the \"//1994\" dates (since this is another format).\n"
