You should combine all of your test cases into one file instead of multiple. I'm okay putting it in a separate file since it looks like it's quite a few test cases.\n3. If your Xlsxwriter already provides those helper test functions, I would much prefer to import them over including them in the pandas code base. Otherwise it's just a bunch of code we need to maintain in parallel.\n"

If they were all in the same file it would become monolithic. For example there is around 400 similar tests in the xlsxwriter test suite. \n\nI'd be happier to put them in a sub directory like the test_json tests.\n\n> If your Xlsxwriter already provides those helper test functions\n\nIt doesn't, unfortunately.

It wouldn't be possible to do that with the other engines because they don't aim for fidelity just compatibility. Which is fine.\n"

I'm thinking it would make more sense to have each writer register themselves (as classes) on ExcelFile. `ExcelFile` becomes an abstract base class-like thing and dispatches based upon the engine passed. Then each writer just needs to implement `_write_cells` and they can work (but they can choose to implement `save` or overwrite anything else if they want).\n\nI'm happy to do it (especially because I suggested that other way to you). Just would be helpful if you didn't rebase your branch for a while (just add additional commits and then you can squash down at the end).\n"
