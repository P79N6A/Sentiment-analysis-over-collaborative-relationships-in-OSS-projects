They are equal, but the 2nd is the exact object, while the first is a copy. These aggregate differently because that's how groupby determines mutation. (e.g. even though you didn't actually mutate, it looks like you are).\n\nImpossible to disambiguate. Nor even sure why you would.\n\nWhat are you actually trying to do?\n"

    "body": "Actually. I asked why `x` cased doesn't behave like what you call the mutated case, not the other way round.\nAlso, I'm returning a series when I get in a dataframe in the apply function. How is `x[:2]` \"mutation\"\nwhile `x.foo` is not?\nIf it's impossible to \"disambiguate\" when the return types are different, well. I don't know what you mean.\n\nThe docstring for group_keys is:\n\n``` python\ngroup_keys : boolean, default True\n    When calling apply, add group keys to index to identify pieces\n```\n\nWhat I'm trying to do is to get the group keys included in the index, when I call apply.\n\nI already have a workaround, It just seemed like a bug. If you're sure this is all just fine, feel free to close.\n"
