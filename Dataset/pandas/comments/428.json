    "body": "no, I do not mean matrix rank, but rank such as that provided in matlab by tiedrank. Actually, that function is a bit limited as there are many definitions of rank: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking\n\nGenerally, it would be nice to have some basic data transformation features built into pandas, such as rank, percentile rank, groupings (where each observation is assigned to a class, eg deciles) etc. I might try to implement some of these, though I am not sure my coding abilities are up to pandas' standards ;)\n\nAnother thing that might be useful is a isnan method that handles different datatypes transparently. Not sure what nan would be for non-float objects\n"
