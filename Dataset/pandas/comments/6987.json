    "body": "@danielballan While getting the last tests of the old test suite running (the ones that were using tquery/uquery), I stumbled on the following issue:\n\nPreviously, `execute` had a `cur` keyword (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/v0.13.1/pandas/io/sql.py#L32), while now this is removed: https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/io/sql.py#L90  (this happened in your commit https://github.com/pydata/pandas/commit/74d091f95ec293c195bd0a5e4886cf5891df2489) (it says 'deprecated', but it is actually just removed). \nThis has following consequence: previously you could use `execute` to do consecutive inserts via the same cursor. This was used in the tests (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/v0.13.1/pandas/io/tests/test_sql.py#L73, actually using `tquery`, but this boils down to `execute`), and this now fails as this behaviour is no longer possible (executing on a cursor instead of connection).\n\nWas there a reason to remove it? (of course, if you want to do multiple inserts, you should just write your dataframe, but is _was_ possible before)\n"

For `tquery/uquery`, I just removed the current implementation and put back the one from 0.13.1, because: a) we deprecate it, so no need to add it to the sqlalchemy mode, and b) the new implementation was not fully backwards compatible (signature changed a bit) for the legacy mode.\n"

I don't know exactly, but it was removed from the requirements by @jreback here: https://github.com/pydata/pandas/commit/043d165290180c6d9e3a480c18e220548af56c53 (see also comment in 4th task point in https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/6292). Apparantly the tests were failing for some reason. And @mangecoeur changed it from MySQLdb to pymysql in the big refactor here: https://github.com/pydata/pandas/commit/2e3f83df8a29f257373ebdc71ebc03f75253a987 (maybe that is the reason the tests were not working anymore, as in requirements it was still MySQLdb). \n\nBTW, it does matter in some way, as one of the tests were failing when I used pymysql (pymysql could not handle a numpy.int64 type, I had to add `tolist` here: https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/6987/files#diff-052a926a9b2c33a84e27d51c8fad3466R1473), and I assume it ran correctly before with MySQLdb.\n"

    "body": "@danielballan OK, I picked your fixed, tests are passing now. Thanks!\n\nI am going to merge this. \nBut for the MySQLdb, also for sqlalchemy we have to test it with mysql, so we are not going to drop tests with mysql. So it can be interesting to test multiple drivers if there are differences there.\n"
