    "body": "Yes. Hence the title.\n\nThe benefits would obviously be far more substantial the more rows that are repeated which is why a bit of boiler plate to switch between caching and not caching could be useful?\n\nThe to_datetime method solves this particular use case. But caching as a method could still be useful in other non date based used cases.\n\nJust thought I'd suggest it as I was reading on one of the mailing lists that many features are trivial to implement, once the developers know about them. Just thought that I would take that to heart and submit this as it was an issue I'd run into quite frequently in my work.\n\nThank you for putting me on to the .to_datetime method though, it's appreciated.\n"
