    "body": "Hello, it is great to hear that you appreciate our accomplishment and that you are committed to resolve this subtle issue at some point. We have briefly examined the possibility of writing tests that would expose this issue, but we have hit two problems:\r\n* The function isn't documented, so even when it became obvious that something inside it was not right, we weren't 100% sure how a proper test of that function should look like, and\r\n* we got totally lost concerning where to put those tests even if we had any. As far as I found out, no function from `ops.py` file has a unit test.\r\n\r\nRemark - there is an alternative solution: The approach taken in this PR is based on guessing original author's (greetings to @jtratner ) intent and correcting the part that was arguably incorrect. An alternative solution would be getting rid of the select/exclude functionality of `add_methods` as the select part was  ineffective the whole time and there is a strong indication that even the exclude functionality is not used at all. This would lift the burden of having to write tests - no code = no tests :-)"
