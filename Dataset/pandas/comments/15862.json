    "body": "This should IMO also extend to generic write methods `pd.to_xxx`. For example, as of v0.23.1, there's:\r\n* `pd.to_msgpack(path, *args, **kwargs)`, where `*args` is an arbitrary number of objects to pack,\r\n* while `pd.to_pickle(obj, path, ...)` switches the order around (and it would be possible to pass an arbitrary number of objects that are then wrapped in a tuple), \r\n* and the other `pd.to_xxx` do not exist at all.\r\n\r\nIt may well be that it makes no sense to have a generic method for all data types (like CSV), but those that are around should have a unified interface as well."
