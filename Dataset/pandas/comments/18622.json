    "body": "Take a look at your elements in `df1`, `df2`, and `df3` once you read them in.\r\n\r\n`df2` has `object` dtype because it cannot cast `COL1` to an integer data-type (the last element causes overflow).  Thus, it casts everything to string.\r\n\r\n`df3` specifies that `COL1` be `object`, which is interpreted by `read_csv` to hold strings instead of integers.   Thus, `df2` and `df3` have matching strings, causing you to join properly.\r\n\r\n`df1` reads `COL1` as `int` because the integers can be held in `uint64`.  When you can cast to `object` with `.astype`, it no longer means casting to `string` but rather just changing the data-type of the container holding these elements.  If you extract the elements individually, they'll still be integers.  Thus, when you try to join, you're joining integers or strings, causing it to fail.\r\n\r\nA little weird, but the interpretation of `object` varies slightly depending on whether you're coming from CSV or operating within `pandas`."
