Without the conversion, auto-boxing is not necessary. \n\nI was referring to the DataFrame example which does work in 0.10.0. Also, creating a Series out of a list of object doesn't convert to datetime64 in dev. So there's a lack of consistency there. \n\nI'm ambivalent to whether automatic object -> datetime64 is correct. It's more of a backwards compatibility issue. \nhttps://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/2624 also came up for me due to the change. \n"
