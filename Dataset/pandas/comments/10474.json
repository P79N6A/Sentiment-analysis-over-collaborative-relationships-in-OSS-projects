    "body": "I've made in improvement to the `to_gbq` function in Pull Request #10857 . The pull request hasn't been merged, but keep an eye on it.\n\nThe improvement is to add an argument `destination_table` to the `to_gbq` function  , so that you can redirect the results of a query directly to a BigQuery table instead of a pandas DataFrame. When the `destination_table` is specified, I set allowLargeResults to true.\n\nNote: A destination table is required to enable large results in BigQuery. Google BigQuery documentation for `allowLargeResults` is available at the following link under the heading <strong>Returning large query results</strong>:\nhttps://cloud.google.com/bigquery/querying-data?hl=en\n"

Also, we were concerned about how to do this in an intuitive way for users who aren't very familiar with BigQuery. When reading results you are also writing them... I'm not particuarly interested in implementing this feature, but I agree it would be nice to have.\n"

Setting allowLargeResults requires a destination table so you are effectively saving the result to a gbq table. If we decide to support this it would be trivial to save the results to a destination table without setting allowLargeResults.\n"
