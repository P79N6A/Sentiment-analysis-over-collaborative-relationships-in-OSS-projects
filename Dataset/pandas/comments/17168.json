    "body": "@jreback thanks for the tip. I looked at the read_csv tests and I'm still a bit confused. Specifically I'm looking at \"test_read_chunksize\" in tests/io/parser/common.py. I see that it's testing two main things:\r\n1) Each returned chunk is equal to that slice of the input dataframe -- not relevant in this case, since read_json is still returning the whole dataframe.\r\n2) Ensure that read_csv is using _validate_integer. I wasn't using that on read_json, but I added it  and am now testing for it."

But in general it could be needed in certain cases to have it as an iterator. For your case you can then do the concat yourself:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [41]: s = \"\"\"a,b\r\n    ...: 1,2\r\n    ...: 3,4\r\n    ...: 5,6\r\n    ...: 7,8\"\"\"\r\n\r\nIn [42]: pd.read_csv(StringIO(s))\r\nOut[42]: \r\n   a  b\r\n0  1  2\r\n1  3  4\r\n2  5  6\r\n3  7  8\r\n\r\nIn [43]: pd.read_csv(StringIO(s), chunksize=2)\r\nOut[43]: <pandas.io.parsers.TextFileReader at 0x7f2e9c2ef630>\r\n\r\nIn [44]: pd.concat(pd.read_csv(StringIO(s), chunksize=2))\r\nOut[44]: \r\n   a  b\r\n0  1  2\r\n1  3  4\r\n2  5  6\r\n3  7  8\r\n```"

I don't have a strong opinion on that and will wait for a decision there.\r\n\r\nI'll point out one thing though. I think there are really two issues here worth separating:\r\n1) The existing implementation doesn't permit loading JSONs even when the full dataframe will fit in memory (this was the original bug report).\r\n2) Should we provide a way for users to handle JSON dataframes that *don't* fit in memory by returning an iterator / generator?\r\n\r\nI was originally attempting to fix (1) but there may be another way to fix it instead. The culprit seems to be [line 349](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/io/json/json.py#L349) which on my laptop kills 10G of available memory with a 1.7GB json object. My solution to (1) was to read in the file in chunks, but maybe there are other possible fixes.  Then, I think a separate pull request could solve issue (2). \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

    "body": "Okay, this is ready for re-review. \r\n\r\n@jreback I believe I've addressed all your comments.\r\n@gfyoung In my latest (coarse) performance testing, with large enough chunks this is not noticeably slower than reading it all at once. Sorry for the false alarm.\r\n\r\nOne other point I want to confirm. I'm assuming (based on my reading of the code and documentation) that currently when `lines=True`, we always have `orient=\"records\"` and the resulting object should always have an integer index `[0, 1, ... , len(obj) - 1 ]`. Is that a true assumption?"

    "body": "Ah, I think I caught it. Let's see. To document fully, in my understanding, there are 4 cases to consider. Here's the current behavior:\r\n1. filepath passed in without chunksize: file is opened, then read in, then closed (not changed from previous)\r\n2. filepath passed in with chunksize: file is opened, then JsonLineReader is returned. When JsonLineReader gets to the end of the file, it attempts to close the file.\r\n3. Buffer passed in without chunksize: json is read out of the buffer using filepath_or_buffer.read(), and then the object is returned, but the buffer stays open. (unchanged from previous)\r\n4. Buffer passed in with chunksize: JsonLineReader is returned and assumes that buffer will stay open until it has finished iterating through. When it is done, it closes the buffer.\r\n\r\nDo those decisions make sense? I could see the argument for changing (4) so that it leaves the buffer open and the caller has to close it.\r\n\r\nI think (and we'll see with this build) the problem was in situation (2), I was checking that chunksize was valid *after* the file was opened, so the test suite correctly caught the error (`assert_raises_regex`) but was then exiting while leaving the file open. If that's true, we'll have to find a way to write a test for this."

Using a function instead of a fixture for the test data, since I need a StringIO and if I use a fixture I can only read it once per test.\r\n2. I didn't make the suggested change around opening the file within `JsonLineReader`, explanation [here](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/17168#discussion_r137959567)."

Given what I'm doing and how the fixture is constructed I'm not sure how using pytests fixture parametrization would actually work here, so if you had something else in mind I'd appreciate a more explicit instruction."
