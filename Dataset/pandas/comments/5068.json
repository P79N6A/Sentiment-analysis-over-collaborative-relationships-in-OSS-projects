    "body": "This seems not so easy: just adding `DataFrame.ix` and the rest of the indexer will not show anything informative, as it seems that sphinx (nor ipython) can't handle docstrings for programmaticly added properties (at least `DataFrame.iloc.__doc__` is `None`) (see also the API documentation for the already added `DataFrame.ix`...) . So it boils down to add a extra paragraph/table which would reference the slicing documentations.\n\nFor `Series.str` it is even stranger: it seems that `str` is added to the class (as `None`) but only set to a proper object when you have a `Series` object. As Sphinx is using the class definition and not a proper object, it throws an error, when `Series.str` is added to the api documentations :-(\n\nOne workaround would be adding Reference to `pandas.core.strings.StringMethods` directly, but then it would need an introduction as well (\"The methods under `Series.str`are implemented in the following class\").\n\nBTW: it seems that the API is not buildable on windows as io.rst is opened as UTF8 (My editors shows it is ASCII) and then fails on the umlauts in there (`data = 'word,length\\nTr\\xe4umen,7\\nGr\\xfc\\xdfe,5`). Not sure why, but changing this line to non umlauts made it work for me :-(\n"
