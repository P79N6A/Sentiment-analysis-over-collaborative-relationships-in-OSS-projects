    "body": "Thanks @NiklasKeck. I thought about proposing this a while back, but never wrote up an issue. `melt` is already quite complex as is, but this seems worthwhile to avoid an awkward `.reset_index() / .set_index()` dance.\r\n\r\nI never worked out the correct way to handle the interaction between the existing index and the `id_vars`. Your `melt_id` is an option but I'll need to think about it more. In an ideal world, I think that `df.index + id_vars` would always be unique, and we'd use that as the MI:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [34]: df.reset_index().melt(id_vars=['Letters']).set_index(['Letters', 'variable'])\r\nOut[34]:\r\n                   value\r\nLetters variable\r\nA       Numbers_1      0\r\nB       Numbers_1      1\r\nC       Numbers_1      2\r\nA       Numbers_2      3\r\nB       Numbers_2      4\r\nC       Numbers_2      5\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut that may not be true in general.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think this would be a useful addition (as an option keyword, to preserve backwards compatibility)"

    "body": "Thanks @TomAugspurger for the rapid and nice response. Your idea to use the original column names (variable) for the additional level is more intuitive than the arbitrary melt_id. I think the result should be unique if the original index and column names were unique. I will think about how to implement that. \r\nA boolean optional keyword argument like keep_index=False might be an idea to ensure backwards compatibility."
