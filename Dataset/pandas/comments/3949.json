    "body": "@jreback I had a slightly different idea about how to do this that I actually think simplifies everything (turn store into a context manager itself).  That lets you do something like:\n\n``` python\nwith get_store(path) as store:\n     store['foo'] = bar\n```\n\nCheck it out here: https://github.com/jtratner/pandas/tree/change-store-to-contextmanager-type\n\nYou could actually remove `get_store` entirely if you didn't default HDFStore to call open in its constructor, but for right now I added a classmethod to do that.\n"
