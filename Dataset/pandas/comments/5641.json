    "body": "Thank you for the quick response\n\n1) I am not selecting on column, but on the second level of the 2-level multiindex. Not sure why I should expect that type of functionality to be a bug. Seems like an elegant way to slice the data and it works in 0.81\n\n2) Can you show me the different ways to do this please. Is the swaplevels version this?\n\n```\nf = f.swaplevel(0, 1)\nf.ix[\"A1\"] = 10\nf = f.swaplevel(0, 1)\n```\n\nThat looks like a workaround to me. Are there more elegant ways to do this\n"
