At least from what I could tell, the link to SO didn't really show examples of this? All I see is:\n\n> The :func:`pd.datetime` allows for vectorised operations using datetime information stored in a :ref:`timeseries.datetimeindex`.\n> \n> Use cases are:\n> - calculation of sunsunrise, sunset, daylength\n> -  boolean test of working hours\n> \n> An example contributed by a savvy user at Stackoverflow.\n"

Very nice to meet someone working in meteo (looking at your GH repos) who will understand me constant push explain and expand to the datetime related stuff...\n\nI though about it after having received the comments from the colleagues here, too.\nThe working hours example is simple.\nThe sunrise/sunset is outside the scope of pandas. So we would need to simplify this.\nOr do you have other examples?\n\nI am still convinced that this should go to timeseries.rst at some time as it is an essential advantage and key functionality of pandas.\n"
