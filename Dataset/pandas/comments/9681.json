Sorry @jreback! BTW in my case I am not using chunks or start/stop, I am selecting on the full file, and it still fails.\n\nIn the meantime I've just been calling ptrepack every time I save an HDF. I don't know if this always solves the problem but it has solved it every time I've tested, and gives an added bonus of speeding up on-disk selects anyway. As long as the tables saved by ptrepack are OK, this doesn't seem like such a bad workaround for now.\n"
