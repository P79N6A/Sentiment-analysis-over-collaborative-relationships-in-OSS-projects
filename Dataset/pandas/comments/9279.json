    "body": "this is a dupe of #2560. you can do this using `query/eval`, see docs [here](http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/indexing.html#the-query-method-experimental)\n\nyou can do chained relationships as well.\n\n`__getitem__` is already hopelessly overloaded. I don't think this add any clarify. And it will be prone to non-vectorized evaluation, losing performance. All of the operations you show above are vectorizable\n"
