That could be a reason to not directly release 0.19.0, but give it another month (or as @TomAugspurger says not wait long with 0.20). \nIn any case, if targeting master as 0.19.0, we probably would want to include some more deprecations so it will take a bit longer.\n"

You can always backport fixes to a new release if you wanted (but this is way too much work to be honest).\n\ne.g. release 0.19.0 in say a month.\n\nThen switch master to 0.20.0 and backport for 0.19.1 (0.19.2), etc.\n"
