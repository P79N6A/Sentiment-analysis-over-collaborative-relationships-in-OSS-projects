But changing anything is extremely tricky as their really aren't enough tests to validate current or proposed behavior. and it is often ambiguous on what to do.\n\n`np.nan` is the missing value indicator, so `None` should NOT be treated specially, but it IS in some places for convience. It is a can of worms. \n"
