    "body": "Solved!\r\nSorry, I should have tested more. Not a bug but my own mis-use - hope this could help others. \r\nBasically to achieve what I wanted from the above example, the line that needs to be changed is:\r\nfrom\r\n   bbb = pd.PeriodIndex(start=aaa,  periods=2)\r\nto \r\n   bbb = pd.PeriodIndex(start=aaa,  freq='3W', periods=2)\r\n\r\nReason, although aaa is itself a 3-week period kind of object, when the PeriodIndex is created for bbb, it somehow using the unit frequency of 1-week. The option freq='3W' is needed by the PeriodIndex constructor in this example.\r\n\r\nTesting a bit more, the PeriodIndex is flexible enough to use the end of Period, as well as not counting the current period. For example:\r\nddd=pd.PeriodIndex(end=aaa-1,  freq='3W', periods=2)  # where today is in 24Dec-13Jan\r\nso the results are \r\nddd[0]    12Nov - 2Dec\r\nddd[1]    3Dec - 23Dec\r\n.... exactly what is expected.\r\n\r\nThanks for this incredible function!\r\n"
