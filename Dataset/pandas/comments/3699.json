    "body": "i used to get this too and i never figured out why. i'm able to save this frame as a pickle on my machine. do you have to use the pickle format? when your data are this big you might want to switch to the hdf5 format as it's more efficient for (querying) large data. csv is definitely to be avoided here b/c as u can see storing all of that extra text adds another 7 ish GB. the pickle format also adds about 1.5ish GB and so does h5 but at least with h5 you get fast query capabilities and backwards compatibility with other python versions.\n"

    "body": "@cpbl, echoing, @cpcloud , This is much easier using `HDFStore`, see http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/io.html#hdf5-pytables,\n\nand you can use table or storer format, depending if you need to query or not. if you compress file size should be reasonable as well.\n\npickle can give these weird errors sometimes, especially with big frames where you need it to work.\n"
