Maybe there is a way to improve the `viewcode` extension to handle this or put some additional hooks in the documentation itself?  Not sure what the best approach would be in that case or even what options exist.\n"

    "body": "This and the fact that almost no user-facing pandas function/method actually does any work other than delegating is one of the reasons I'm not sure about the usefulness of this. That said, it wouldn't hurt anything to have (except the size of the docs, which is probably not a concern). Many refactors ago I got out of the habit of using ?? in ipython to look at the source for pandas because of these same reasons.\n"
