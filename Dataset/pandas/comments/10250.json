Notebook: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/pydata/pandas/blob/a7d730f30d87027464cc1747b38a844ba8d09fe3/style.ipynb\nNewest additions are `.set_properties` for setting static (non data-dependent) properties and hooking into our `pd.options.display.precision` for controlling rounding. Both of those are pretty nice to use.\n\nCurrently working on\n1. supporting slices somehow / applying certain styles to certain columns / rows\n2. Table styling.\n\nSupporting slices is tricky because our state is a dict mapping `(row_position, col_postion) -> [styles]`. Whenever you do a selection you lose that position information. We can go from label to position with something like `get_indexer`, but that will only work reliably for Indexes with no duplicates (I think). I'll keep thinking on this.\n\nTable styling is just additional styling applied to the table as a whole, instead of individual cells. Pretty easy to do, it'll probably just be a dictionary you pass in when making the `Style` object, or when you `.render`.\n\nShould have some time on Saturday.\n"

    "body": "This is awesome. It'll be a step change for us in using IPython Notebooks to show data, rather than writing out to Excel and doing formatting there.\n\nTo put some weight behind the slices - there are a couple of concepts there:\n- Which set of data to use as comparisons for a certain value. For example, in the [image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1312546/10718706/0117fce6-7b47-11e5-80b8-cd90c7d4c107.png) above, should the '1.0' value in the top left be at the bottom end of the range or the top, depending on whether it's compared to its table or its column.\n- Having different styles for different slices. I think this would be really useful. Re the label -> position issue, just my $0.02, but this working only on unique indexes may be fine - generally if you're looking at output you want unique labels anyway.\n"

    "body": "@maximilianr thanks for the comments.\n\nRe the first one, that coloring is done relative to the column. That's how `color_bg_range` (which will be renamed) is written. But we or the user could pretty easily write their own function\n\n```\ndef color_table(df):\n    # normalized df\n    ...\n    # fill colors\n    colors = [ ]\n    return DataFrame(colors, index=df.index, columns=df.columns)\n```\n\nand use that with `df.style.applymap(color_table)`. Or we could include that, maybe as an option on `color_bg_range`, maybe as a separate method.\n\n> Having different styles for different slices. I think this would be really useful. \n\nAgreed, I'd say it's necessary. At the very least, I _have_ to implement it so that errors aren't thrown if you have a DataFrame with a non-numeric column :) I'm also leaning towards just punting on non-unique indexes for now.\n\nI'll try to get some documentation relatively soon. I think things are to the point where the overall interaction is stable.\n"

Anyone have ideas on the best way to get the HTML output of an object? Is there a way to trick the IPython directive to think it's in a notebook (cough @jorisvandenbossche  :smile:)? I'll do some research tonight. It looks like Bokeh does it with a custom directive and [sourcing another python file](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/_sources/docs/user_guide/layout.txt).\n"
