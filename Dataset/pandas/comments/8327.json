    "body": "@jtratner I would be careful with any of the Google client libraries including gcloud. I've been testing a Java library they have which uses gcloud and it apparently uses some custom interval version of boto which conflicted with my desktop python distro's boto library. So, the only way I could get it to work was to run their java code from within a clean python virtual environment. As Jacob said, I would suggest sticking to the APIs.\n\nI'm not sure about the need, but another potential feature for your hackathon might also be some method for authenticating in a server environment.  Also, if you want to talk about testing or how we set up the pypandas.t​est@gmail.​com for Oauth, let us know.\n"

If that's not available, then fall back oauth2client.tools.run\n"

    "body": "@azbones Just came over to take a look at this and did a bit of digging. It's actually not a huge change, and I've already written a patch to fix it. The replacement for [tools.run](https://google-api-python-client.googlecode.com/hg/docs/epy/oauth2client.old_run-module.html) is [tools.run_flow()](https://google-api-python-client.googlecode.com/hg/docs/epy/oauth2client.tools-module.html). Change the import from \n\n``` python\nfrom oauth2client.tools import run\n```\n\nto \n\n``` python\nfrom oauth2client.tools import run_flow, argparser\n```\n\nand invoke with \n\n``` python\ncredentials = run_flow(flow, storage, argparser.parse_args([]))\n```\n\nNot sure if I should push this to #9722 or wait for that to accept, and make a new pull for this issue.\n\n@jreback @jacobschaer - Thoughts on how to handle this?\n"
