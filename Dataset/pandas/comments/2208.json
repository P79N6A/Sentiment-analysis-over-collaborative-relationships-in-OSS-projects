One comment: One thing I noticed in your docs and tutorials that I find under-emphasized for someone who is used to strict numpy and dictionary indexing: That a DataFrame[index] can access both columns AND row indexes. That I believe can throw newcomers easily overboard. Thanks a lot for your hard work!\n"
