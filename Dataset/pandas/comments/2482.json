As for the docs, yes, they are incomplete. This was my first PR and I didn't put documentation everywhere that it belongs. I think changhiskhan took care of some of it though. Feel free to elaborate.\n"

I'd rather see them tested by people who regularly use those flavors of SQL, but I think I could get them off the ground and minimally test them.\n- That said, I support adopting SQL alchemy and eventually relying on it for all frame writing, if that branch works.\n\nOne additional thought: One way or another, we need to infer data types more carefully. jrebeck provides some helpful references in other parts of pandas. Before anyone takes that on, we should decide whether we are ultimately going to toss all of this out in favor of SQLAlchemy.\n"
