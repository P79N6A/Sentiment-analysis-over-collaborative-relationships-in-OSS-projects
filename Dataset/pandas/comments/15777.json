In `tz_convert_single` there's a check (`_is_tzlocal`) and codepath for localize timezones. The check seems to be specifically for `dateutil` objects while `pytz` objects can pass through here as well. Including a check for localized pytz objects (i.e. `tz._tzname == 'LMT'`, might be a better check than this) seemed to fix this issue. Will investigate further tonight. "
