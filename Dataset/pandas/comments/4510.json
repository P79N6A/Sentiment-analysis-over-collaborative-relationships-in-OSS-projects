    "body": "Just to add some notes on this issue.\n\nThe Excel file formats stores numbers and formatting separately. Numbers are (mainly) stored as IEE754 doubles and the format that they are displayed in is stored separately.\n\nAs such the current handling or `float_format` in `to_excel` is a no-op. It could be repurposed as a a format string to be applied in Excel, which might make more sense. I'll add a PR to do that.\n\nIt would at least fix the issue raised in the SO question.\n\nAssign to me.\n"
