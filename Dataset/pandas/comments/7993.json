There were quite a few differences between windows and linux but the mostly came down to where `dateutil` looked for the timezone info (because it uses system data). I don't recall anything like the example you've shown there. \n\nPart of the difference might be that `maybe_get_tz` is calling `dateutil.tz.gettz` while your example uses `dateutil.zoneinfo.gettz`\n\nI'm not sure about modifying the line in tslib, it's a while since I looked - what did you change it to?  For background, I added that to work around problems when dateutil loaded tz files from an archive but didn't put the right zone info on. Without the zone name, we can't serialize the timezone object.\n"

    "body": "@dbew \n\n> There were quite a few differences between windows and linux but the mostly came down to where dateutil looked for the timezone info (because it uses system data).\n\nLooked `dateutil` source little, and it uses internal zoneinfo files in Windows cases. Maybe this causes mismatch. Even though the display name is changed, internal object looks different. \n\n### In Windows 7 / Python 2.7.6 / dateutil 2.2\n\n```\n>>> t1 = dateutil.tz.gettz('US/Pacific')\n>>> t2 = dateutil.tz.gettz('America/Los_Angeles')\n>>> t1\ntzfile('America/Los_Angeles')\n>>> t2\ntzfile('America/Los_Angeles')\n>>> t1 is t2\nFalse\n\n>>> t1_2 = dateutil.tz.gettz('US/Pacific')\n>>> t1_2\ntzfile('America/Los_Angeles')\n\n>>> t1 is t1_2\nTrue\n```\n\nThus one possibility is to change the following line to:\nhttps://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/tslib.pyx#L1139\n\n```\n            if isinstance(tz, _dateutil_tzfile) and tz._filename != zone:\n                tz._filename = zone\n```\n\nBut if there is any concern, leave it as `dateutil` issue and only fix the test case to use non-problematic zone name.\n"

    "body": "@sinhrks Your description of the `dateutil` behaviour matches my memory of it. I wasn't very clear in my earlier comment, sorry.\n\nIn linux, `tz._filename` will be the actual filename e.g. `/usr/zoneinfo/US/Pacific` not just `US/Pacific` so I think your test will always evaluate to True. I'm not sure what the effect of changing the filename be in those cases - possibly just a bit confusing that there's a difference between `maybe_get_tz` and `dateutil.tz.gettz`. AFAIK, it's not used for timezone conversions and the only place we use it in pandas is for serializing timezone info (and in the long run, I think it might be better to use `pickle.dumps` for that instead of just the filename).\n\nYou could try it and see..\n"
