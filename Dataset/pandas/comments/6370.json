    "body": "As for `__getslice__`, the problem is how python2 is implemented: when you do `obj[i:j]` it first looks for `obj.__getslice__(i,j)` falling back to `obj.__getitem__(slice(i,j))`. Since `ndarray` provides `__getslice__` (at least in 1.7), the only thing that we can do in order to provide custom `__getitem__` is to override `__getslice__` to reroute those \"basic slicing\" requests.\n\nI've rewritten this a bit, but this caused test breakage. Will look into it later.\n"
