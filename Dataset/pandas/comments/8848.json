    "body": "@jreback I just want to make sure I understand this issue. If there's a series of Period objects, there are some additional methods desired on the .dt accessor? And these would be the same for PeriodIndex, as from looking at the code it seems that PeriodIndex is what's really behind the scenes of the .dt accessor?\n\nI should note there's a whole host of methods that are available to datetime_series.dt that aren't on period_series.dt, including: ceil/floor/round, is_{month,quarter,year}_{start,end}, microsecond, nanosecond, normalize, tz, tz_convert, tz_localize.\n"
