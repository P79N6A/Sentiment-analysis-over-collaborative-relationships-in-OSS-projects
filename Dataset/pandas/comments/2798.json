    "body": "You have different dtypes for these series.\n\n```\nIn [9]: nans\nOut[9]: \n0   NaN\n1   NaN\ndtype: float64\n\nIn [10]: nones\nOut[10]: \n0    None\n1    None\ndtype: object\n\nIn [11]: bools\nOut[11]: \n0     True\n1    False\ndtype: bool\n\n```\n\n `Nones` are are _not_ treated like `np.nan`, they are an object type (like a string). \n\nThey will be coered into `np.nan` in a constructor if there are other types.\n\n```\nn [12]: Series([None,1])\nOut[12]: \n0   NaN\n1     1\ndtype: float64\n```\n\nhowever in your example, they are left as `object` because pandas doesn't know what to do with them (similary to how mixed types are handled)\n\nThe return type for a binary operation (e.g. `*` here), is whatever numpy says it is, which is the first type, maybe upcasted (e.g. an int \\* float == float type, unless the float is equiv to an int)\n\nyour last example blows up because the return type is `bool`, which you can't do any operations on except for comparison to other `bool` types\n\nthe `bools * nans` is a special case in numpy I think where you get `NaN` output, not sure why\n"
