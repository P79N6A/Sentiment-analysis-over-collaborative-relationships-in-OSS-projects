    "body": "IIRC this was actually special cased to allow this to be `object` dtype, with the passed `None`' s remaining. (further, `Series([None])` is another case).\n\nWe don't coerce provided `None`'s in a constructor for `object` dtype, e.g.\n\n```\nIn [3]: Series(['a', None])\nOut[3]: \n0       a\n1    None\ndtype: object\n```\n\nSo I agree that we should be consistent, but its difficult to know when to leave an actual `None`.\n\nI last changed this [here](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/commit/cdf611ab8ba1c3ad26493070265341a5d2676655), though I recall this being the case for quite some time. We like to preserve an inferred dtype, in this case `object`.\n\nSo I am not sure this is incorrect. This is an explicit user action, we treat `None` and missing as slightly different.\n\nNote that the other issue is #14381 actually is different as its an entire missing value (e.g. a scalar or an array-like), so the dtype is set to the default (meaning float). \n\nI suppose one could argue that these are the same.\n\n@shoyer @jorisvandenbossche @wesm \n"

The scalar value just denotes a constant value for the full columns, so `None` or `[None, None, None, ..]` should give the same result IMO. \nThat is also what 0.18 does:\n\n```\nIn [7]: pd.DataFrame(dict(a=[None]), index= [0])\nOut[7]: \n      a\n0  None\n\nIn [8]: pd.DataFrame(dict(a=None), index= [0])\nOut[8]: \n      a\n0  None\n```\n"
