    "body": "\r\nnobs is a pointer to a double and is incremented and decrement accordingly as add_var and remove_var are called. if nobs == 0, then you want to reset mean_x and ssqdm_x to 0 as you do in the else condition. my question is this -- isn't it possible that nobs could be some epsilon value and not exactly equal to 0.0 ? I dont know floating point math that well, and it could be fine since all we do is incrememt by1 or decrement by 1 so it could be fine. just wondering in case this should be:\r\nif abs(nbos[0]) < 1e-11 or something\r\n\r\nthanks"

    "body": "This seems to be fine, it appears that `nobs` is only ever incremented / decremented by whole integers.  I'm not deeply familiar with this code, but we are most likely using a double instead of an int here to prevent having to cast `nobs` when it is used in fp division - this is some old code that was carefully optimized long ago.\r\n\r\nPlease re-open if you see a case where this causes a problem, thanks for taking a look."
