    "body": "this is not supported. pandas objects are stored in numpy arrays (generally) which if they have `object` dtype are simply pointers to python objects. deep-copying them does not imply that numpy array is deep-copied itself (I don't even know if that is actually supported). Deep refers to the indexes themselves being copied.\n\nIt would be expensive to do this. Not really even sure of a usecase for it; generally the actual data are scalar type data (e.g. float, int, string), not actual python objects themselves. \n\nThis is an anti-pattern to store python objects here. I suppose you could add a note to the doc-string.\n"

    "body": "Thanks, that's helpful, I understand why the copy method behaves as it does. I'm wondering if it could be made more clear in the documentation since the word \"deep\" seems at least slightly ambiguous here.\n\nI typically use a DataFrame for numbers, but sometimes I like to have a column that holds some other kind of meta-data in an object. This way I get all the benefits of indexing and mergeing and can keep the meta-data associated with the data (even if this effectively disables many of numpy's nice features and efficiencies)\n"
