    "body": "Honestly in this case it was mostly a mistake -- non-monotonic time indexes are not very useful.\n\nI think the right behavior is probably to raise a `KeyError` anytime an empty array would be returned from an indexing method. Returning a length 0 array in some cases means it is possible to end up with unexpected empty series and dataframes. Inevitably, you run into an error later (or worse, maybe not!), but it's harder to debug when it is further from the source.\n"
