    "body": "DataFrame.boxplot was united under DataFrame.plot() with the `kind='boxplot'` keyword argument a while back. boxplot was the only plot type to ever support faceting (with the `by` keyword).\n\nThere aren't any plans to add faceting for other plot types right now. Other libraries like seaborn or ggplot do it and handle DataFrames nicely.\n\nA pull request to document the `by` keyword, noting that it only has an effect with kind=boxplot would be welcome! There's an issue [here](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/7045) about validating keyword arguments to `df.plot` and warning / raising when things are unused.\n"

    "body": "This is a hazard of our current API design, which uses a single `plot` method to dispatch to many different underlying plot types. The ultimate fix is probably to encourage more specific methods like `df.plot.scatter()` rather than `df.plot()`. See https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/9124 for more discussion of that design.\n"
