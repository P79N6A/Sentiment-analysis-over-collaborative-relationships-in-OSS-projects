    "body": "Haven't reviewed the change in detail but am rather neutral on the idea, maybe a slight -1. I'm a huge fan of consistency, though the thought of deprecating 12 parameters in one function alone adds a lot of code and headache from an end user perspective that I am not sure is worth it. Even the built in csv module has arguments like `fieldnames`, `restkey` and `restval`\r\n\r\nLet's see what others think. In the future you'd be better served opening an issue first for the discussion to be had before going in and coding, though it sounds like this exercise was partially to familiarize yourself with the code as well so no big deal"
