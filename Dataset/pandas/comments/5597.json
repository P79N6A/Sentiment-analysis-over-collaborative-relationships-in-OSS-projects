As a result I now have to write `.loc` everywhere, even where it's manifestly not necessary.\n\nAdmittedly the only way I can think to get around this offhand is to have `df[\"a\"]` return a different Series view object each time, so that it could grow a `_chained_count` value which can be incremented. \n"
