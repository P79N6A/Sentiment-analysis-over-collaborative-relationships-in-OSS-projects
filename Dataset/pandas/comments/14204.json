    "body": "I think there's probably still some confusion here. The \"fix\" in 0.19.0 makes it impossible to install the pandas sdist (.tar.gz or .zip) packages published on PyPI without manually preinstalling cython in the environment. The sdists of prior releases up to and including 0.18.1 could be installed without cython present. Digging deeper, it seems this worked because you were (and still are, in fact) shipping the cython-generated files in your sdists, which made them installable without cython present. So yes, _creating_ the sdist does require cython (and this is what I assume you mean by \"building from source,\" e.g. `setup.py install` or `setup.py sdist` or similar), but _installing_ the created sdist did not require cython until the additional raise ImportError was added in 461e0e9. I get that it made \"installs from source\" fail with a slightly more obvious error, but it also broke \"installs from sdist\" at the same time.\n"
