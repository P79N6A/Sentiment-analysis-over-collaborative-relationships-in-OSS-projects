    "body": "Yep, I also follow the initial poster. @jreback I think the groupby guide is already in very good shape, certainly. But I personally think it is important to see that the user guide and reference docs are complementary, and _both_ important. \nAnd there are indeed some things missing in the _api_ docs (I was also working on a draft issue to list some of the missing docs, will try to finish that).\n\n@mhlr It would indeed be a bit more constructive to say what you miss than just saying that it limits the usefulness. In fact, if you would want to do that, give some concrete things you miss in the docs about this, that would be very helpful for us! Really. \n(a PR even more helpful .. :-) but already knowing what is missing also. If you are working a lot on this, it is sometimes difficult to see what information is missing for a new user).\n\n@JanSchulz What do you exactly mean with the missing \"combine\" step? Because I think you misinterpret the combine step, as this is about combining the different groups together in one dataframe, not about combining the output of the groupby with the original array (for that you can just assign it to a column in the original array, or concat both, ..) That is not clear enough from the first paragraph in the docs?\n"
