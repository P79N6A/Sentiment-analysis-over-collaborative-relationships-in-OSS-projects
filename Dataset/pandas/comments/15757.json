    "body": "I think it would be worth exposing whatever the new soft convert api is 0.20 (I haven't looked at it in detail), referencing it in the `convert_objects` depr message, then deferring `convert_objects` to the next version, if possible.\r\n\r\nI say this because I know there are people (for example, me) who have ignored the `convert_objects` depr message in a couple cases, in particular working with data where you don't necessarily know the columns.  Real instance:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf = pd.read_html(source)[0]  # poorly formatted table, everything inferred to object\r\n                                                # exact columns can vary\r\n\r\ndf.columns = df.loc[0, :]\r\ndf = df.drop(0).dropna()\r\n\r\ndf = df.convert_objects()\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at this again, I realize`df.apply(lambda x: pd.to_numeric(x, errors='ignore'))` would also work fine in this case, but that wasn't immediately obvious, and I'm not sure we've done enough handholding (for lack of a better term) to help people transition."

As @jreback said, it has a lot of *magic* and the precise behavior in all situations could only be described by the actual code being executed. This does not strike me as good design. \r\n\r\nThe real issue here is that the well-defined rules for converting objects have already failed by the time that `convert_objects` was usually called (e.g., text data was imported from `read_`* and `object` was returned).  Given that there are not nearly lossless choices available, it seems very difficult to arrive at a reasonable set of rules that don't seem arbitrary.\r\n\r\nIf there was a need for a `convert_objects`-like function, then I think it would need to start from scratch by first describing a concrete set of actions that are more aggressive than the default converters but not so as to destroy the utility of this function.   \r\n\r\n"
