I don't really have any suggestions.\n\nYou could install MinGW and compile pandas from source yourself, follow these instructions:\n\nhttp://docs.cython.org/src/tutorial/appendix.html\n\nCould you try that and let me know if that works? \n"

At least that way I can determine if it's a Windows 7 issue or a 2.7 issue.

The XP boxes all have a \\Python entry in the Registry:  HK_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Python\\PythonCore\\2.6\\InstallPath\nand another:\nHK_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Python\\PythonCore\\2.6\\PythonPath\n\nDoes the pandas installation on Windows reference anything in the HK_LOCAL_MACHINE section of the registry?\n"
