    "body": "Well, my suggestion will be don't use Google Account credentials, which is very personal and should not be presented in any public servers. Please consider using [Service Account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount) instead. \n\n> The Google OAuth 2.0 system supports server-to-server interactions such as those between a web application and a Google service. For this scenario you need a service account, which is an account that belongs to your application instead of to an individual end user.\n\nSo to sum up, reasons to use Service Account are:\n1. SAFETY. Binding services with individual's Google Account can lead to severe security issues and might expose your service to malicious attack. This is because you cannot restrict the usage of personal account.\n2. Easy process. All you need to do is downloading JSON Key File from Developer Console, and read it in your app.\n\nAlso please note that, Service Account is designed for your app to access Google API without requiring user to sign in. If, you want users to access their personal data (with their own permission), then use browser flow instead.\n"

Binding services with individual's Google Account can lead to severe security issues \n> and might expose your service to malicious attack. This is because you cannot restrict the usage of > personal account.\n> 2.    Easy process. All you need to do is downloading JSON Key File from Developer Console, and > >read it in your app.\n\nUsing JupyterHub may reduce the concern . See [JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub)\n\nFrom JupyterHub [GettingStarted](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyterhub/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md):\nSingle User Server: a dedicated, single-user, Jupyter Notebook is started for each user on the system when they log in. The object that starts these processes is called a Spawner.\n\nI'm not too familiar with JupyterHub. I'm going to start playing around with it to see if there is a better (secure) solution for authenticating users using the browser flow. JupyterHub looks very promising.\n"
