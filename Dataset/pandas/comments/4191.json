Given that `.from_csv` differs in some defaults compared to `read_csv`, the output of replacing `.from_csv` with `.read_csv` will change on some tests.\r\n\r\nShould we continue testing for the output that we currently get from `.from_csv` but use a modified version of `read_csv` in the test to get the same output?  Or should we modify the expected output for our tests?"
