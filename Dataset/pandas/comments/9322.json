    "body": "So I don't think this is going to be this easy:\n- patching pandas in the conf file also patches it for all code examples in docs -> not possible\n- patching pandas would possibly work when we only do it in api.rst itself, and when this is parsed as last. But, the problem is that the `autosummary` extension already gathers objects to build in the beginning, and then fails with `WARNING: [autosummary] failed to import 'pandas.Series.dt.microseconds': no module named pandas.Series.dt.microseconds`\n- I thought that the IPython directive would create a new InteractiveShell instance for each file, but this is not the case. So the full doc build is done in one and the same InteractiveShell. We could reset this at the beginning of each rst file (this resets the namespace, something we should maybe do in any case), but this does not seem to remove the patching:\n  \n  ```\n  In [1]: import pandas as pd\n  \n  In [2]: pd.Series.str\n  \n  In [3]: pd.Series.str = 'test'\n  \n  In [4]: pd.Series.str\n  Out[4]: 'test'\n  \n  In [5]: from IPython import Config, InteractiveShell\n  \n  In [6]: IP = InteractiveShell.instance()\n  \n  In [7]: IP.reset()\n  \n  In [2]: pd.Series.str\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n  <ipython-input-2-bc49ee86f4ca> in <module>()\n  ----> 1 pd.Series.str\n  \n  NameError: name 'pd' is not defined\n  \n  In [3]: import pandas as pd\n  \n  In [4]: pd.Series.str\n  Out[4]: 'test'\n  ```\n  \n  But I am not really familiar with the IPython internals, so maybe my reasoning is a bit simple.\n"

    "body": "OK, a few things we _could_ do:\n1. Do checks to take `str` out of `__dir__` for invalid types. This would eliminate the auto-complete issue, but I think `s.str?` would give the same message you showed above (object `s.str` not found).\n2. Return a standard `StringsMethod` object, but add some sort of hook that checks that the type is valid before every method lookup. You could still auto-complete `str` methods, though, and this is more complex for `.dt`, because it can create several sub-types of accessors.\n3. Make `s.str` for invalid types some sort of \"deferred error\" object that raises `TypeError` when any attribute is accessed but with a copied docstring from `StringMethods`. I tossed together an implementation, which gives us functionality like the following:\n\n```\nIn [15]: s = pd.Series([1])\n\nIn [16]: s.str.<tab>\n\nIn [17]: s.str\nOut[17]: <pandas.core.series.InvalidStringMethods at 0x107a32fd0>\n\nIn [18]: s.str?\nType:        InvalidStringMethods\nString form: <pandas.core.series.InvalidStringMethods object at 0x107a8e150>\nFile:        /Users/shoyer/dev/pandas/pandas/core/series.py\nDocstring:\nVectorized string functions for Series. NAs stay NA unless handled\notherwise by a particular method. Patterned after Python's string methods,\nwith some inspiration from R's stringr package.\n\nExamples\n--------\n>>> s.str.split('_')\n>>> s.str.replace('_', '')\n\nIn [19]: s.str.cat\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-19-e75e3f77c883> in <module>()\n----> 1 s.str.cat\n\n/Users/shoyer/dev/pandas/pandas/core/series.py in __getattr__(self, name)\n   2552\n   2553     def __getattr__(self, name):\n-> 2554         raise self._error\n   2555\n   2556\n\nTypeError: Can only use .str accessor with string values, which use np.object_ dtype in pandas\n```\n\nUnfortunately, it is not possible (AFAICT) to make an object on which `repr` raises a `TypeError` but for which `__doc__` is well defined.\n\nI'm -0 on these options. They add complexity and I don't think they're that much more usable -- if `s.str?` says not found, the first thing I'm going to try to do is see what `s.str` is, which will raise the TypeError. I also don't think there are that many who search through the Series namespace for methods -- there are simply too many methods/properties for that to be very useable.\n"

    "body": "There are still some warnings with the doc building. I added AccessorMethod and AccessorAttribute documenters, but will probably have to do something similar for the accessor itself (Series.str and Series.dt), as these show up somewhere in the docs and are generating the warnings (possibly in the `pandas.Series` api page, as this page automatically lists all methods and attributes).\n\nBut, it are only warnings (the rest of the doc builds fine), and on travis the api isn't even built, so OK for merging this if it is ready for you. \nAnd I can look into the doc issue later this week (probably no time first two days)\n"
