    "body": "Well, a good question is, why are you doing that instead of `np.where(s == 0, 0, 1)`? Vectorization is good :) \n\nFixed this in the above commit (`np.where` called with a scalar results in 0-dimensional arrays, so I inserted a hack to \"unbox\" the value inside). However I would expect the result to be integer and not float (the current behavior).\n"
