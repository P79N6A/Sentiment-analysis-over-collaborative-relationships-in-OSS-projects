    "body": "Sorry for the delay here!\n\nAs with usual in packaging, there are a million solutions :)  \n- turn it off, and let people figure this stuff out themselves.  Something like \"if there is no setuptools, then tell them eveyrthing they need to get going\"\n- just require one of `setuptools` or `distribute`.  It think this is the case for most people.  \n\nLook for some inbound code... I think this is an improvement... \n"
