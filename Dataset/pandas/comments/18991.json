However, perhaps this is actually a more appropriate approach. If anyone can confirm what the data is converted from, that would be helpful, e.g. can I assume that the above line of code would first read in the value as a `str` and then cast it to a `decimal.Decimal` type? I would like to avoid the situation that the data is e.g. read in as a `float` automatically and then casted to `decimal.Decimal`, since that could introduce errors. "
