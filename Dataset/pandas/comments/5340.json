It looks to me like MS -> milliseconds was added when it was decided that pandas would provide most/all of the capabilities that were in scikits.timeseries and they were using the mapping MS -> milliseconds. This PR looks like what I would also do to revert back to some consistency for MS. I'll check it out locally and let you know if I notice anything from the statsmodels usage side and my code.\n"
