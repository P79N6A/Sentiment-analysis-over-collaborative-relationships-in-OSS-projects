Surely, this isn't what you meant. \n\n### Question 2\n\nShould I create a 0.15.1.txt? Confusion? Duplicated effort?  Separate PR?\n\n### Comment 1\n\nb0ed056 removes the maps, and safe_cc_only, as requested. \n\nI'll leave it as a separate commit, until you or somebody else acknowledges the dynamism that World Bank introduces to the ISO \"standard\".  If you acknowledge the example of KSV, or other unknowable exceptions, and want to still stick to the more hard coded list, that's okay by me.\n"

Standard ones\n2. Unknowable Non-standard ones\n3. Bad ones\n\nTurns out, there are 4.\n1. Standard ones (Eg. USA)\n2. Unknowable Non-standard ones with data (Eg. KSV)\n3. Unknowable Bad ones - ignored by World Bank (Eg. BLA)\n4. Unknowable Bad ones - which cause API requests to fail completely (Eg. XXX)\n\nMy code, and logic, now handles all of it, IMO, extremely well and passes things appropriately to the user based on ignore/warn/raise at both the country code and indicator level. \n"
