As far as I know, it also does not really work with conda? (and conda is currently the main way we recommend to create an environment)\r\n\r\nIf we want to make certain things easier, I would rather add some commands like `make inplace` (for rebuilding the c extensions), `make check` (for code checkers), ... which can be agnostic to the environment / development tools you are using for the rest."

Taking care of correct dependencies, building the c-extension etc. this process would be more simpler to understand. \r\n\r\nIdeally there was a file written in python (easy to understand for devs only knowing python) which defines various tasks [build_doc, build_extension, test_all, test_fast, check] taking care of all steps that are required to predict a running/failing ci-build before actually commiting/opening a PR.\r\nIf the ci-builds run by calling tasks of the script it doesn't create duplicate code.\r\n\r\nIf there wasn't the incompatibility with conda tox would be a great possibility. \r\n\r\n> Is the existing tox.ini file usable/useful in its current state? Only real opinion here is that it should be either maintained or removed.\r\n\r\nI don't think the file is usefull anymore as it didn't change since more than a year and it creates a folder `.tox` in the root directory with all the dependencies which isn't excluded from flake8 causing it to run for a long time.\r\n"
