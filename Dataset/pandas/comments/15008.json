Xref https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/11666\r\n\r\n+ Write methods should support the following compression methods: `None, 'infer', 'gzip', 'bz2', 'xz'` (no zip since it's perhaps bad practice).\r\n\r\n+ We may want to support both long and short compression names. Currently, you specify `gzip` not `gz`, but `bz2` not `bzip2`.\r\n\r\n+ Read methods should support reading from a path, buffer, or URL.\r\n\r\n+ Write methods should support writing to a path or buffer.\r\n\r\n+ Textual payloads should support the encoding argument\r\n\r\nRegarding the consolidated codebase:\r\n\r\n+ I'd favor greater separation of the code for 2 and 3. This way when pandas becomes 3-only, the entire 2 sections can be deleted.\r\n"

In any case, having a few but scattered `if PY2` statements are also rather easy to delete). But if all related code is contained in io/common.py, it should not be too difficult to find a good balance in that one file here.\r\n\r\nOne more consolidation that would be possible for `read_csv` is between the python and c engine. I *think* the c engine still has its own logic for handling compression, while I do not think this is needed to be in the cython/c code (I don't think this is the performance sensitive part?)"

There are still a few things I need to understand before I can make that call. One issue is `mode` in `_get_handle`, which currently is poorly documented. Presumably this could include `t` for text or `b` for bytes, which will have some interactions with Py 2 or 3.\r\n\r\n> I think the c engine still has its own logic for handling compression, while I do not think this is needed to be in the cython/c code\r\n\r\nAgree the `c` engine implementation should be consolidated, unless there is a major performance issue. But the duplicated [functionality with `_get_handle`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/e27b29697f0dcf9359f01a19edb2f20c6d728b6c/pandas/parser.pyx#L604-L694) appears not to be c optimized (I'm not sure as I don't know cython)."
