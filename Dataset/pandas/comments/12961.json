    "body": "`end_of_first_byte` needs to be an int I think (at least 2 bytes wide).  Even though its value is copied out of a uint8 array it needs to be promoted to uint16 or it overflows later on.  We have to be very careful in the decompressors about types.  It's been a few months since I did this but there is a lot of subtle stuff in there and I spent a lot of trial and error getting it to work.  The masking and shifting gets messed up if things are not exactly the right int type (too wide or too narrow both cause problems).  I don't think this is covered well by our tests.  These are very outdated and poorly documented compression algorithms.  Most of the compression codes are rarely used except in larger files.  To keep the test suite fast I created only small test files which don't hit all the compression codes.\n"
