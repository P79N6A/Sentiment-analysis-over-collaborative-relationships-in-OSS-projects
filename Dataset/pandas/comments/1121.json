Without big changes in these distributions, I would recommend to target the version numbers contained therein. Imagine you need to update your base system every week or month just because some sub-library is released. We wanna be productive with the top-level (i.e. pandas) and not spend time with installation woes...\n- I personally think that keeping the young age of pandas in mind, you can only use it effectively with the latest git maters. Other versiones in the distributions would miss important features or have the bugs that you usually try to fix quite fast (within a few days).\n\nPlease post here once the things would work with v15.1 and I will try to pick up the daily LP build configuration.\n"
