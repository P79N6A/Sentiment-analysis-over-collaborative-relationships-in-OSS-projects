    "body": "@cancan101That's true in that making any feature more powerful is potentially helpful.\nBut balance, scope and focus should take priority in the context of a larger package.\n\nI think the current API that @cpcloud put together is just expressive enough\nwithout trying to do too much and in this specific case it actually handles the \nmotivating case out of the box without extension.\n\n@phaebz, thanks for putting in the time doing this. I'm sorry we're going to \npass on merging this. We'd like to keep growing pandas with features that make\na significant difference to it's users without gradually morphing pandas into \nsomething else. That sometimes means saying no to little changes that seem\ninnocent in themselves, it's the cumulative effect we're trying to keep tabs on.\n"
