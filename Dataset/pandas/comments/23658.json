This is *not* the same as the commit-hooks talked about in #23616, but I'm copying half a comment from there for completeness:\r\n\r\n* with the recent changes to the CI, git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff doesn't cut it anymore.\r\n* it should IMO be replaced with a single script (ideally platform-agnostic, at least from a user-POV) that tests all the relevant lint checks (flake8, isort, doctests), which should also have a box in the PR template. (this script could be eventually enhanced with all sorts of things; e.g. check that dependencies are up to date; run tests that were changed by PR, etc.). #23707 is maybe a small step in that direction."
