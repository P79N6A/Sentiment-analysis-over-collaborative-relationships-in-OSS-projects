Could we in principle make a LatexStyler that adapts the template and the html specific methods? \nIn that case that is maybe a better / more powerfull way forward to adapt styling.\n\n@nbecker You know you already have to specify the column for `formatters`? So the question is only about also knowing the index of the element?\n"

That gives you iteration logic over every row, and every column in each row, including the style information attached to that item. Also the export / use functionality. Those items could be put in a base class pretty easily I think.\n\nOther than that it'd be up to the subclass to implement\n- the template (I don't think there's much that could be inherited from a base template), which wouldn't be terrible.\n- the `_translate` method, which would be the bulk of the work\n- Any builtin styles (like `.highlight_max`)\n"
