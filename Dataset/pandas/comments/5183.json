    "body": "okay, that's reasonable, so it's just what you have + df1.index.equals(df2.index)?  I still hanker to add a recursive all :P (plus you then would not need to copy to values).\n\nAlso, would it make more sense to do:\n\n``` python\ndf1 = df1.values\ndf2 = df2.values\n((df1 == df2) | ((df1 != df1) & (df2 != df2))).all()\n```\n\ninstead? seems like that could be simpler. Also, I'm assuming you'd want to check if their shapes are compatible or even just the same (so that you can always safely use equals), so maybe: check shape (len(columns), len(index)), then check dtypes, etc.  And then would you want to have a check_metadata argument too? (i.e., column names, index names, etc)\n"
