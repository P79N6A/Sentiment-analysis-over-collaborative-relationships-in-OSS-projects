    "body": "It could be done using arrays or lists for `start` and `end` in the `BusinessHour` and `CustomBusinessHour` constructors.  For example:\r\n\r\n    mexico_hour = BusinessHour(start=['07:00', '16:00'], end=['14:00', '18:00'])\r\n\r\nOr it could be done using a single 2D set of start and end times:\r\n\r\n    mexico_hour = BusinessHour(open=[['07:00', '14:00'], ['16:00', '18:00']])\r\n\r\nPersonally I'd be happy with either.  Once constructed, usage should be exactly the same.  For example if I add one `mexico_hour` to `2017-02-23 13:30` I would expect to get `2017-02-23 16:30`, and if I add seven hours I would expect to get `2017-02-24 11:30`."
