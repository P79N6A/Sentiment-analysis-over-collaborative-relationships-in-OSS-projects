You're suggesting that the implementation in `.style` will eventually replace the current `to_html` implementation, if I understand you correctly. IMHO, that's fine for the future, but at least for now, this PR can fix the bug, and then getting `max_rows` support in `.style`, as well as removing the current `to_html` implementation to use `.style` instead (which reduces the size of the code) should be handled as a separate issue.\r\n\r\nHow about this idea. You merge in this PR, and I'll create a new issue for `max_rows` and `max_columns` support in `.style`, and I can separately work on figuring that out. And maybe there should be another issue to reduce code size by removing the current `to_html` code and using `.style` instead??\r\n\r\n"

In any event, the tests from this PR would be great to have.\r\n\r\n> And do we have the guarantee that someone will do it before 0.20?\r\n\r\nI'm not going to have time to work on it before 0.20.\r\n\r\n> @TomAugspurger Does style already support truncated output?\r\n\r\nNo, not yet. It wouldn't be terribly difficult code-wise. I just don't know if it's appropriate for `.style` (what if you highlihgt the max, and the max is in the truncated section? But that's a separate issue).\r\n\r\n> Is jinja2 in a possibly problematic dependency?\r\n\r\nI'm OK with it (and its dependency on MarkupSafe), but willing to be convinced otherwise.\r\n"
