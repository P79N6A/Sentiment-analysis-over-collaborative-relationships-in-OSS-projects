    "body": "I'm a research scientist, and I'm trying to record the essential variables that I measure in a set of pilot experiments. I'm recording movies of an animal, and taking scalar measurements about the environment the animal is in, like temperature, humidity, etc. \n\nThe data is heterogeneous — for each frame of the video during the experiment, we also have a combination of scalars, arrays and strings that describe what occurred during that frame. Because these are pilot experiments, we don't necessarily know what is essential to measure yet. We need to be able to query over all of the scalar columns to do analysis, and we need to be able to append data.\n\nThe main problem as I see it, with respect to the current capabilities of HDFStore, is heterogeneous data. I need to be able to append and query the scalar data, but each row necessarily is associated with image data.\nI've written a bit of software to store the images separately, but I've not found a way to do queries in the kind of \"one-line\" way that store.select() allows you to do. I find that kind of simplicity _absolutely necessary_ for exploratory data analysis. \n\nIf you have a great way to organize pointers with some wrapper code so that I and my colleagues don't have to think about this kind of data scattering that's fine. The key point here, though, is reducing our mental workload, so that we can think more about the research question, and less about the data. \n\nOne thing to note, though with our heterogeneous data. If we store a column \"images\", that contains a 2D array, you can be guaranteed that every row that has an image column will have the same size 2D array. Does this uniformity help at all? I do wish that DataFrames would take advantage of this, so if I did \n\n```\ndf['images'].values\n```\n\nit would return a 3D numpy array, as opposed to an array of objects. Do you think that's a possibility?\n"
