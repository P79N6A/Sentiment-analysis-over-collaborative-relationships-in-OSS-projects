Would you just throw away one of these?\n\nYou have to take care when using non-unique indexes...\n\n_Note: in future please copy and paste your **actual** code (you can use [github markdown ](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/)), ideally with the formula to create the variables (A and B here). That way **we** can copy and paste it too, and test. We can't do that with an image._\n"
