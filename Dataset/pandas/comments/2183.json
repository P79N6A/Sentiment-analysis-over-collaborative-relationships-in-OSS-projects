Python datetime always needs a year/month/day/hour.\n\n> extended info: would DataFrame.describe be enough?\n\nwell, I do not think so:\n\n`describe?`\n`Generate various summary statistics of each column`\n\nSo this is like the summary of a column. \n\nextended info would generate the descriptives for all columns and add it to the dataframe\n\nI.e. create long-term hourly averages.\n\nOr would you do this also with DataFrame.describe?\n\nThanks again!\n"
