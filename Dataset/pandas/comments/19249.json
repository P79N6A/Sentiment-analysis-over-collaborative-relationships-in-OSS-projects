    "body": "Because offsets are perf-sensitive it might need to be implemented in cython.  That aside, rolling it into PandasObject makes a lot of sense.\r\n\r\n`Block.make_block` looks a lot like `Index._shallow_copy`.  A bunch of the DatetimeIndexOpsMixin arithmetic/comparison (ones that I think @TomAugspurger agrees would go nicely in an Array-level class) use _shallow_copy.  Making the Block classes conform to the IndexOps name conventions would make that refactor a lot easier."
