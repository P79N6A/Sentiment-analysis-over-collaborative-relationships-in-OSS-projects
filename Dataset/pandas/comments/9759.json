It was `np.seterr(invalid='raise')` that was contributing  to `FloatArrayFormatter._format_strings` generating a `FloatingPointError`.  \n\nIs there a policy with regards to how pandas should support different error handling configurations?  At present it seems that behaviour when `invalid='raise'` is slightly inconsistent in that your test case above fails as previously described yet `pd.DataFrame(data=[np.nan, 3, 4]),to_json()` does not generate any errors. \n"
