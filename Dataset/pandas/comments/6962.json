    "body": "First, I hope the title of the issue makes it clear that this is about bokeh integration. For me the first step was in trying it naively out with the bokeh session management redirecting `stuff` (I have no clue) to the notebook (i.e. `output_notebook()`). As I don't know how DataFrame.plot() is implemented, I was just assuming that above errors could be caused by bokeh messing with the output of graphics when pandas.DataFrame tries to plot something? Anyhow, as I had a MPL plot popping up with the standard df.colname.plot(), that's been cleared up. I still can't make the data plot with (x=, y=) so I'll make another issue out of it. This should be left for bokeh things.\n"

I think they are still working on this, but maybe you can try that out? (it is the function `bokeh.pyplot.show_bokeh()` that you have to call afer you created the figure I think)\n\nI think for pandas itself this is a more interesting path, than fully implementing an alternative `.plot` using bokeh in the background instead of matplotlib.\n"

    "body": "Hey guys, right now our MPL compat comes from @jakevdp `mplexporter` module. At SciPy the MPL guys stated their intention to make a more fully featured and robust JSON import/export facility for MPL that libraries like Bokeh, mpld3, and plot.ly can use to provide more complete MPL support. We will certainly adopt this when it is ready but I don't know what their expected timeframe is.\n\nI do think that native Bokeh integration is worth considering, you could have more interesting features liked linked panning and linked selections much easier. But we are happy to help out integrating Bokeh more closely any way we can, whatever route you pursue. \n"
