    "body": "Wow, that \"you touched it last\" spiel never fails to bring on a spontaneous attack of joy... :)\n\nYes, yes I did. having uniform image size improves the overall appearance of\nthe docs. As for blurriness, I looked (very closely) and I guess you're right. but\nhonestly, it seems like a minor issue to me.\n\nThe reason I conformed everything to 6,4 was specifically because previously\ndifferent figures were forced to differing dimensions.\n\nJust dropping the spec does not work, have a look at the figure just above\nhttp://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/example-pandas-docs/html-plot-withoutwidth/visualization.html#box-plotting\n\nThere was a similar issues opened in the past, though I can never find anything with GH search,\nwhich suggested a workaround that never worked for me.\n\nIf you can find a way to sharpen the images and keep the dimensions uniform,\nthat's great, otherwise I'm for leaving things as is until such a solution does turn up.\n"

    "body": "I suppose it's a bit of matter of personal taste, and that is difficult to discuss :-)\nBut for me, when I saw the changed docs a few months ago, that was almost the first thing that struck me, that there seemed something 'wrong' with the figures (apart from the new style)\n\nBut:\n- about the uniformness, I think that the dimensions of the figures in the second link are about as uniform as before (apart from the one figure you mention). Because instead of saying via `@savefig`: _\"every figure has to be 6 in wide in the docs\"_, there is the approach: _\"every figure has a figsize of (6,4) as defined in mpl_stylesheet\"_ (and I did not change that, that is how it is now)\n- about the one figure which is much larger (I also mentioned that in the issue). This is indeed a problem. It's because `grouped_hist` defines its own figsize if it is not given (and you could argue if this is actually a feature or rather a bug as it does not follow the default, but that is another discussion :-)).  \n  But this is easily solved by either specifying a `@savefig width=6` for this case, or specifying a `figsize=(6,4)` in the function call\n\nI don't directly think of another approach to have the figure sharp, I think they have just to be displayed at 100% (so not specifyinig the width as in the second link).\n\nOK, this is not the most important issue, but it was just something that annoyed me a little bit.\n"
