So I don't think we need to sort the categorical first... but maybe I'm misunderstanding something.\n"

    "body": "Ok... this is more messy than my original rules. Right now, for `line` plots we don't do any relabeling of x / y-ticks (aside from time series). Between that precedence, the fact that categories don't really make sense for line plots (what's \"between\" the categories?) and matplotlib's global state so people may plot multiple things to the same axes, I don't think we should support LinePlots with CategoricalIndex / CategoricalSeries. Same goes for Area. I'm not saying we should raise with an Error. We just don't have a good way of breaking the value plotted from the label that's attached to it.\n\nBarPlot absolutely makes sense. I think I have that \"working\" for a CategoricalIndex. Things are still a bit strange since we don't actually use the `.codes`.\n\n![screen shot 2015-06-11 at 4 10 34 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1312546/8118485/cbfbf8e4-1054-11e5-97a3-3e19fe2fcefa.png)\n\nThis is consistent with how regular Indexes work with barplots when there are dupes.\n"
