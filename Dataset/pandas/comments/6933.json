    "body": "@jtratner it's the same as one of my earlier PRs about `__getitem__`: we drop type inference that might've changed index type after deletion of non-matching elements. That is if we go with \"trivial\" solution.\n\nIf trivial is not necessary, then dtype inference may be preserved without the necessity to traverse each element of dtype=O array. If one made an int8 array of object classes (or int 16 if 255 classes is not enough) to accompany the main one, then instead of enumerating all entries each time it would suffice to do single `np.bincount(x.ravel()).nonzero()` to find out which classes are present. Memory overhead for that int8 array should be acceptable, but it may require some non-trivial effort to make sure they're in sync.\n"
