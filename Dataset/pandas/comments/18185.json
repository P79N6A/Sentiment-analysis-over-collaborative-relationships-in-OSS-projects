This is actually what the current behavior implicitly assumes, and I'm suggesting we should change it.\r\n\r\nSo take for instance\r\n\r\n```\r\npd.Series([1, 2, 3, 1], dtype='category').reindex([1,2,3,4,5], fill_value=2)\r\n```\r\n... which also fails: this is surprising even for those who have clear how categoricals work - that is, that 1) they have native support for NA and 2) they don't like to change the categories (which, by the way, is true when assigning, but ``reindex`` is different, so I would allow changing them)."

I think you would need to coerce to ``object`` type to be semantically correct. Though I suppose you *could* add the new category. Not sure how odd this would be."
