I know I've done :scream_cat: :arrow_right:  :rage: many a time in the past when trying to grok that code.\n\nI don't know what the unicode spec is for RTL languages, but it sounds like you do. I'd love to learn about it from you in the context of some real code that actually uses it.\n\n> What two mechanisms are they that you mean?\n\nWhat I meant what that iterating from RTL doesn't change to iterating from LTR when you prefix the characters with a LTR character (not sure why I thought it should, but then I don't understand why it goes from RTL in the first place). So, just forget what I said above about the two mechanisms.\n"
