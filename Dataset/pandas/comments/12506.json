Converting those errors to `ValueError` suddenly causes breakages all over the place in `test_parsers.py` and other files like `test_html.py` or `test_excel.py`.\n\nWhile I haven't made the commit here, I was able to locally change all the `CParserError`'s to  plain `ValueError`'s with no issues.  However, that is breaking backwards compatibility to a degree.  What do you think is the best way to proceed?\n"
