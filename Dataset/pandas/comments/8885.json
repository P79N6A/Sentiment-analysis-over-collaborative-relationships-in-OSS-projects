    "body": "> Also, I think the default scaling (at least for strictly positive variables) should probably be not be offset by the minimum value, but be absolute (relative to some scale). Right now it looks like that would be hard to achieve.\n\n@shoyer not sure if I understand what you mean here. So, for strictly positive values, have the size of points range between 0 and the max size, with the minimum data value falling at some point within that range? Like if we have data values  of `[50, 75, 100]` and a max size of 200pt, the 50 val will be 100pt in size because it falls halfway between 0-100?\n\nThat probably works pretty well actually. I guess the reason I originally had a min size set was that I didn't want small values to completely disappear, but as long as the min size can still be bumped up to prevent that, should be OK. I'll try to test that out later today.\n\nI think part of the reason I went with a minimum size, with the minimum observed value assigned that size, is because that's what ggplot seems to do, from what I can make of [their source](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2/blob/master/R/scale-size.r).\n"

    "body": "@onesandzeroes Can you add to the test the cases where:\n- `s` is an int\n- `s` is a column (but not a string, the column itself as `df['col']`)\n- `s` is a numpy array (this last one broke for `c`, see PR https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/8929 that fixed it). I don't think in this case it will be a problem, as you check whether it is a string, but we should test it.\n\nFurther, I was wondering, it seems a bit strange / inconsistent that `size_range` is not applied when you provide a column / array but only for string. I know it is because you can't modify the values through the string directly, but still.\n"
