IIRC he said there are quite a few places where we don't take full advantage of what cython has to offer. For example if you type a variable as just `ndarray` you incur the overhead of the fully general get item c API whereas if you type it as `ndarray[type]` the getitem syntax goes directly to the underlying raw pointer array. \n"
