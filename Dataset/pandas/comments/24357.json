    "body": "I encountered this when trying to upgrade to 0.25dev from a 0.21.0dev.  The old code, with its more convoluted handling of i8_conversion had the side-effect of retaining the datetime dtype in cases similar to the above example.  I have a fix for my case.  Looking at the code and the tests, I think a few changes would solve the above problem as well (and a few of the test cases with \"FIXME\" comments) but that is a little more invasive. \r\n"

    "body": "My exploration into this issue leads me to believe that pandas is altering to `float` type to avoid the eventuality that I could be combining an `int64` with a NULL type (None, or np.nan, etc).  The only way I could solve this was to remove the use of 'int64' in my code, which unfortunately means coercing every python `int` to a `float64` and avoiding pandas native type detection.  :(  \r\n\r\nNot a very elegant solution but it did work.
