    "body": "well, what you are doing is not thread-safe at all. The `groupby` itself would need to be protected by the locks, but more importantly, ATM, you will find NO improvement because all of this code needs the global-interpreter-lock (GIL). I have a PR that will address this, see #10199 \n\nbut what you are doing is actually quite a tricky problem. You should look at [dask](https://dask.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to solve this. This uses the GIL releasing code under the hood (and schedulers) to make multi-threading work quite nicely.\n"
