    "body": "Well it is also inconsistent with `rrule` which would be the closest analogue outside of Pandas. I actually ran into this when converting code from using rrule to pandas and it definitely seems odd. I'm not sure what application defaults to the end of the year.\n\nAs for `pd.date_range(start='2015-01-01', end='2015-12-31', freq='A')` - it seems to me strange to drop the starting date, since most cases in python ranges are left-closed (include the start but not the end). To me this is like writing `range(0,10,10)` and getting `10` instead of `0`. Similarly if you use the `periods=1`  you supply a start date that is not included in the resulting range. This IMHO is weird behaviour, considering that the simplest case should follow the most common pattern.\n"

    "body": "Is left closed more common though (I agree that is is for other python ranges)? But for date stuff, I could see this being the natural behavior (I'm thinking of finance). This had to have been a deliberate choice, and not an implementation detail I think.\n\nAnyway, this would be a big break in backwards compatibility, and I don't think that the benefit justifies the break. Do you? If we did do anything, I'd break `date_range` into two functions, one for specifying start, end and freq, and another for specifying (start or end), periods, and freq.\n\nUsually in these situations I'd say we need better documentation. The offsets docs are clear I think, maybe we should note that in the docstring for date_range / DatetimeIndex?\n"
