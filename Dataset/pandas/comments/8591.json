    "body": "cc @bjonen\n\nthis pickles/unpickles just fine, but in this case the `__getstate__` in the CustomeBusinessDay offset delets the calendard, but not from the `kwds` (so the pickle fails). can you do a pr to fix (you can use this test case), and maybe run thru all of the offsets just in case, they are prob not directly tested for pickliblity.\n\n@bazeli thanks for reporting\n"
