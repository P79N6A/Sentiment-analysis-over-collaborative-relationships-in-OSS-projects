    "body": "@TomAugspurger I'm not certain it's a dupe, but certainly related. Seems to me #20599 relates to the need of raising the error in the first place, and calls for using some other datatype than a `C long` internally when the int in question is outside [-2<sup>31</sup>+1, 2<sup>31</sup>-1]. This doesn't seem to be solved in 0.23.4, but the error is not raised anymore (maybe related to some work done on #20599). Loading `big_int = 2147483647 + 1` into an `python int` works, but a `C long` gives no guaranty of correctness. In my opinion, loading an int into a df from json that can't be represented in the used datatype should at least raise a warning, but preferably an error ."
