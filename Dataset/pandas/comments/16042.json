And did a search and apparently we do not use `is_floating_dtype` internally, so would remove that\r\n- the distinction between `is_*` and `is_*dtype` is not for all of them consistent. For some, the `is_*` version only accepts scalars, for others it also return True for a array/series of such elements."
