    "body": "prettyplolib also has a dependencies on brewer2mpl. \n\nI'm not so sure about this: the lib changes mpl.rcParams directly (and some on import -> so simple importing prettyplotlib will change _other unrelated_ matplotlib plots!) and this means that you can't use your own style anymore. \n\nSo, an example which I think won't work anymore is this:\n\n``` python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pandas import *\nfrom numpy.random import randn\n\nts = Series(randn(1000), index=date_range('1/1/2000', periods=1000))\nts = ts.cumsum()\n\n# plots normal and if this is implemented \"nicer\" plots\nts.plot()\nplt.show() \n\n# prints currently a xkcdified plot, but probably won't work if the plot function sets other \n# mpl.rcParams *after*  the `xkcd()` context manager sets the mpl.rcParams for the \n# xkcd version\nwith plt.xkcd():\n    ts.plot()\n    plt.show() \n```\n\nThere are also other libs like prettyplotlib out there, which wrap matplotlib to produce nicer plots:\n- https://github.com/yhat/ggplot\n- https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/\n\n[**EDIT**: It would be nice if they have a way to us there own styling system without getting styles from whatever system you choose.]\n\nThere is also functions around,  which style already existing matplotlib plots or set some \"nicer\" defaults:\n- restyle a existing plot: https://github.com/wrobstory/climatic/blob/master/climatic/stylers.py -> `rstyle(ax)` -> http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/wrobstory/climatic/master/examples/ggplot_styling_for_matplotlib.ipynb) \n- saner mpl.rcParam defaults: https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/blob/master/seaborn/rcmod.py -> `set()` \n"

    "body": "Okay, that's a very good point, let's keep it under an optional argument (that's disabled by default).  We should be guarding mpl imports altogether so that matplotlib is not imported unless (and until) the user calls for plotting. Bottom line, I'd like pandas to have better plotting output because the default styles are not great and most people (including me) want to be able to not think about it.\n\nOther notes:\n- I suggest prettyplotlib because a number of people were using it at PyData, it looks nice, and the developer is both very engaged _and_ was willing to do the work to integrate it.\n- Yhat's ggplot is pretty much impossible because it's a completely different syntax and setup from matplotlib.\n- Seaborn looks interesting; however it requires both moss and pyhusl, so it's not as if there are less deps.\n- If it turns out to be too difficult to incorporate prettyplotlib directly, the stylers from climactic look like they could be a good option.\n"

However, It's off by\ndefault because I considered changing another lib's settings as a side-effect of `import pandas` unacceptable, more so because the user may have her own customization in matplotlibrc and clobbering them without being asked is poor manners.\n\nIt may be possible to `save/modify_rcParams/plot/restore` to isolate pandas' from other matplotlib\nclients, in which case I'm all for \"pretty by default\".\n\nNote that the `mpl_style` option allows devs to define other styles, which you can leverage to supplement\nthe available styles. There's an optional callback mechanism triggered when an option is set you may find \nuseful.\n\npandas' deps have exploded in the last 6-9 months and increasingly support for multiple\ndeps providing similar functionality (html parsing, excel IO, serialization) is added. That has costs\nin complexity, bug surface and on the test matrix but since it can take a long time for these costs \nto mount there isn't much incentive for restraint except by admonition (apologies).\n\nWould it be possible to integrate new styles by using the existing style mechanism rather then introducing\nmore deps?\n"

At the least, we should probably enable the `mpl_style` by default.\n\nWhat I'd like to come out of this is a more abstracted plotting, maybe changing pandas/tools/plotting to be a set of static methods on a class that then gets looked up by NDFrame (and could then be subclassed by plotting libraries). Alternatively could just allow monkey patching.\n\n@olgabot would it be enough to just have an init method that changed the default color scheme? (maybe monkey patching mpl_style). Or do you actually need to use prettyplotlib's _methods_?\n"

They're\nworking on better ways to specify all parameters for functions and I think\nit'll be much easier to have nice pandas default plots then.

    "body": "@olgabot, we did add an option to activate mpl styles which is a substantial improvement on\nmpl defaults (no retina-searing blue, for one). It could surely be improved and we'd _love_ to \nhave your contribution.\n\nI thought prettyplotlib does substantially more then just color schemes, and we did end up\nsaying no to the really sophisticated plots you offered to add to pandas (with some redirected to Seaborn?).\n\nMaybe the scope of the issue is unclear, but re making ggplot/seaborn/perttyplotlib\ninto pandas deps, they're already built on _top_ of pandas and the integration level\nseems reasonable.  So I think we can close.\n\n_There's no shame in being a substrate._ :)\n\nOn making pandas defaults prettier, we can have a new issue with more focused scope.\n"
