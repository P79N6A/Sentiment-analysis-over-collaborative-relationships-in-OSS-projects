    "body": "@kshedden this is a good idea. See the related issue #9496. We want to try to follow a common pattern for the invocations of this. These other 3 io libs that do this already have a pretty well-defined interface (e.g. they take `chunksize/iterator` arguments. And provide an iterator returned back to the user so this is pretty transparent.\n\nSo if you'd take a look and follow this common pattern would be great (separate issue is actually to consolidate this into a base-class). You are welcome to actually start there if its easier. We can then build off your effort.\n\nlmk and we can then examine your proposal in more detail.\n\ncc @bashtage\n"

The interfaces to read_stata and StataReader should now match read_table and TextFileReader, at least in terms of features that are common to both file types.  \n\nComments in the current StataReader source state that it is not possible to read the value labels from the end of the dta file in a pre 117 version file without first reading through all the data.  It's not clear to me that this is the case.  Using the record size, it is possible to calculate the total size of the data in bytes, and jump from the data location to the value labels location.  I did this and all the tests pass.  However I don't know all the ins and outs of Stata files. so it is possible that I am missing something here.\n\nI still need to work on docstrings.\n"

I'll try to deal with this.\n\nstrls are not mentioned in the stata format 115 docs (http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?dta_115), so  I'm guessing that they were introduced in format 117.  We don't have a problem seeking to the value labels section in 117 files, the comments in the code that mentioned this limitation were explicit about it being only an issue for format <=115.\n\nSo putting this all together it looks like we might be safe jumping to the value labels based on the size of the data table (the part with fixed length records) in format <=115, and in format 117 the position of the value labels is explicitly given in the header.\n"

IIRC you did speed up some string stuff, so this should be nice\n- pls add a release note (reference this PR number as there is not an associated issue)\n- pls update the io.rst in the stata section with an example of this use (see the HDF5 or read_csv section for an example of usage).\n"
