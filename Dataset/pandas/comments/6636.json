    "body": "@jreback The function `_dt_to_float_ordinal` is (almost?) exclusively used by the  `DatetimeConverter`, which is invoked if you pass a `DatetimeIndex` directly as one of the axes to matplotlib.\n\nAs far as I can tell, `DataFrame.plot` instead insists on converting any `DatetimeIndex` to a `PeriodIndex` (e.g., https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/tools/plotting.py#L1520, https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/tseries/plotting.py#L56). These plots will therefore use the completely different `PeriodConverter`. This converter for instance uses unix time rather than MPL's new date format (days since 0001) and uses its own tick locators and date formatters.\n\nMy 2 cents: the optimal and unifying solution would be for MPL to support numpy's datetime64, which would ideally also allow plotting on the scale of nanoseconds. There doesn't seem to be any ongoing work in that direction though (https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/1097). \n"

    "body": "My guess it that both converters came from different backgrounds: the PeriodConverter and plotting code seems to originate from scikits.timeseries, while DatetimeConverter instead from MPL's plot_date function and dates.DateFormatter. \n\nConversion with PeriodConverter is actually quite fast, but DataFrame.plot does quite a bit more than just converting and plotting. For instance, conversion is done dynamically when zooming/panning. Though a nice feature, it does seem to make zooming and panning somewhat laggy for large data (say >1M points).\n\nI do not think it really warrants change, as both approaches (DataFrame.plot vs pyplot.plot) seem to have clear benefits. The former is easier and more feature rich, while the latter is simply faster (and obviously gives a more low-level control to the user). In this context, the DatetimeConverter is actually just a small convenience for those users that prefer to use matplotlib directly.\n"
