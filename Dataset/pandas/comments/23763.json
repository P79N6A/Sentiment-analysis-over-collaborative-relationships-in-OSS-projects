But after around one week wasted only in trying to understand how the sidebar toc tree is built, and still not much idea what is going on... I'm quite convinced that even if there will be challenges in building a sphinx replacement, I'll be saving a lot of time. There are so many things I want to customize, and even something very small is incredible complex with sphinx.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'll build this as an independent project, I don't expect anyone else from the pandas team to be involved, and won't propose migrating until our website can be fully generated with it. So, no big deal on trying. :)\r\n\r\nIn any case, I appreciate the feedback, and will update you if I make progress with this."
