I tried to create an overall more consistent interface providing methods to get all important metadata from the stata file.\n\nThe way the parser works, however, is basically the same.\n\nI don't know if the performance of this parser somehow improved compared to old statsmodels parser.

Then there is the ability to read R dataframes, just seems to be in a different place.\n\nI cannot say too much about the statsmodels fork of the StataReader as I always worked with the original one (at some point, the statsmodels version converted everything into floats, which didn't work for me). The current version should keep the original data formats and adds some goodies in terms of carrying metadata along (I should add that PKEuS is my student).\n\n@jseabold: Happy to join forces here once you have produced something that gets rid of bottlenecks.

It doesn't look like the StataReader code is really much different than the statsmodels version, except the encoding, labels handling, and the use of Categorical (is this a correct reading of the changes?), so updating the optimization based on this won't be difficult. I can go ahead and deprecate the statsmodels version for our next release when I need to. It might be polite to acknowledge the original author Joe's work and my changes as well, though I'm not overly concerned about this.\n\n@PKEuS I noticed you removed the format checks.

It also depends whether they originally compiled the data or if it came from another source. I usually try to track them back to an original author / agency and get express written permission.
