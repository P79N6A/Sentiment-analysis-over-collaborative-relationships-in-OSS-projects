I'll keep digging through it, but I thought it was worth noting down."

This made the tests configure themselves properly, but predictably, a whole bunch of other tests have broken (37 in total). I wonder if there's a case to be made for some kind of values config file where each types' allowed values info is kept, including the default null values."
