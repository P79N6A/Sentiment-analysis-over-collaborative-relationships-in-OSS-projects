    "body": "Some warnings and errors are only relevant for the programmer, but sometimes the warnings/errors will be shown to the end user. So if your software is used by people with different languages (like french and spanish), it's common to have the code throw \"this is an error\" for english users, but spanish users would see \"esto es un error\" instead, and french users would see it translated into french, etc. Obviously, you can't have a reg ex expression match all the different languages; so you need a system where each error/warning has a unique name/id.\n\n   Granted, most python programmers would never bother to handle multiple languages in their strings -- that's more common in \"big, professional\" software written in C++/Java/C#. So I'm not saying internationalization is the major reason we should implement my proposal above. Getting internationalization is just a bonus.  The real reason we need this feature isn't for internationalization; it's for the issue described on #1893 (way at the bottom of the thread)\n"

    "body": "Yes, prefixing each warning with a unique number would be sufficient (as long as the different warnings that are really the same warning have the same number -- for instance, on #1893, the set_index warning on line 2762 should have the same number as the sort warning on 3192 and the fillna error on line 2479, since they're really the exact same warning just appearing in different places).  I'd be OK with that solution as long as its followed consistently. \n\nI understand you that the specific warnings I cite will be going away in the next release. I just want to find a way to handle warnings better for the next time.\n"
