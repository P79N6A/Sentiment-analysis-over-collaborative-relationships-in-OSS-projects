I do think this is a regression -- albeit untested and deprecated behavior.\n\nIf we are going to release another bugfix release 0.15.3 in the near future, I think we should restore this. On the other hand, if it's going to be a few months until 0.16, we might just move on with the deprecation (though that _is_ faster than usually desired). The good news is that at least 0.15.0 _does_ include some warnings.\n\nIf we are going to revert this and do a more gradual deprecation, we should not wait until February -- then we'll end up with users relying on the new behavior (in fact, this may already be an issue).\n"

But I am speaking about index - index operations (`idx - idx`), and this has been _explicitely_ documented as a feature that it are set operations. This was also tested, but those tests have been adapted when we deprecated it (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/8227).\n\nWe also used this feature within the pandas codebase (those have been adapted to union/difference). I myself for example used it in code for my daily work, but I did not yet used that code since 0.15.1, so I did not yet noticed it.\n"

I think we all agree that the set operations are a bit strange and confusing, as other operations (index with scalar/array, multiplication, ..) are all the 'normal' element-wise operations. We discussed that thoroughly in #8226, and we all agreed to change this behaviour, but decided to first give it a deprecation cycle.\n\nThe question is a bit how 'severe' this break is, and I must say I can't really judge it. We did not yet receive any reports (which could suggest it is not used a lot), but on the other hand, I think a lot of people still have to update to >= 0.15.1.\n"
