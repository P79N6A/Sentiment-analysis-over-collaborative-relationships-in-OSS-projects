    "body": "this has nothing to do with windows, rather how caching works. Data is stored in columnar format; when However the cache tries to load is linearly, which defeats the purpose. \n\nBut, and here's the issue, your data is probably already in this format to begin with if you are constructing it with ndarrays.\n\nBottom line is that pandas follows what numpy does, this _might_ be changed in the future, but is completely non-trivial.\n\nFinally, not sure why these trivial differences even make a difference in reality. You are likely bound by other parts of calculations.\n"
