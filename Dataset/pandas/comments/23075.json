The set of unused asv directives is infinite and includes any attribute on the object that isn't one that is recognized by asv.\r\n\r\nAre you proposing limiting the class variables that can be defined?\r\n\r\nFor example, how is it possible to know that `goal_time` was intended to be used by asv and isn't just an attribute used by something else on the class?"
