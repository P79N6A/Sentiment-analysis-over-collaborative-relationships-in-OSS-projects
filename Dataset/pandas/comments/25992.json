    "body": "I believe the CI failures are due to my added test, which is causing s3fs to be imported due to importing the `_strip_schema` function from `pandas.io.s3`.  This was really the only way I could see to add a test for this fix, other than try to load something from an actual S3 bucket.  Is it okay to add s3fs as a test dependency, and if so, how do I do that?"
