Sometimes it checks whether this is an `ndarray` and does different actions depending on that and in other cases, it is simply assumed `values` is an `ndarray`-like. While _in principle_ this should not be done, this is done quite often and a source of bugs I expect to run into quite often. I don't expect that `fletcher` will be usable anytime in the next 1-3 months but my main motivation to work on it currently is to exactly discover these things in the `pandas` code base.
