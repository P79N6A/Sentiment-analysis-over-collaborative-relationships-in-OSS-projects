    "body": "It's not really the same question. In the previous question I had a problem with the new version forcing dates to Timestamps which caused existing code not to work. I've adopted this and the code I write now doesn't use datetime.date objects in the index. However, I'm working with data which is produced by existing programmes written by others which isn't aimed at Pandas and has a dictionary with tuple keys containing datetime.date objects which I would like to convert to Pandas. \nI have no problem with the index of the resultant Series (or DataFrame in the case of a dict of dicts) being forced to contain to Timestamps. The problem is that values of the result are all NaN which seems like an a genuine bug. \n"
