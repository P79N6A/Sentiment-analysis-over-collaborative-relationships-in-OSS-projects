I meant the image of the built docs you posted here in the PR, but now I see it (don't know what was going wrong yesterday)\n\nDo you have any idea where the empty code cells are coming from? As normally, the ipython directive with the `suppress` option should work for that (to execute something, but not show the output).\n- One comment: I would make the tables (certainly in the beginning) a bit smaller as 3 times 4x4 (the smaller, the easier to overview what happened I think\n- Wishlist: color the data frames, so you can more easily see in the result from which dataframe the data is coming (but certainly not needed for this PR ..)\n\nOne thing I was thinking. Towards the future, would it be simpler/more flexible to use html instead of matplotlib figure? For that we could use `df.to_html()` (would also render multi-index better), and then try to find some way to insert that html output into the rst  during build time, so it can just be rendered. But not sure if this would be an easier approach as the matplotlib one now. \n"
