So its not a column limit per-se, but an internal limit. As we have discussed before, this is in general not a good idea to store very wide tables. You might want to explore making these 3-d actually (a Panel); Then these become long tables (which is quite efficient).\n\nmaybe something like: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/reshaping.html#reshaping-by-melt\n\nmight help.\n\ne.g. 1500 \\* 4 characters \\* 8 bytes character = 48kb (plus other meta data that I don't know exactly how big)\n"

So if its already a list, then leave it like that.\n- when creating new, you can write as a `CArray`. You should then be able to interpret as list/CArray on reads.\n\nFor testing, I would make a couple of tests tables in 0.16.1., that comprise different dtypes/indexes, maybe with compression, etc. all can be small. To ensure that things can be read from prior versions.\n\nThis will be a forward-compat break, IOW, an older version of pandas cannot read a 0.17.0 created HDFStore, but I don't think that's a big deal.\n"
