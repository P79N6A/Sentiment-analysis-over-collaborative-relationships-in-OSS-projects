    "body": "@1kastner : Windows support for building from source has been tricky.  I've had success with `Cygwin` before, though I personally have been wary of it (why install an entire Unix-like environment when you just need the tools?).  I would use `MinGW` or the tools from the `MingwPy` project.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you would like to further investigate the `Cygwin` path, you will need to trace back the error by hand to identify how `self.ld_version` gets hit.  The stacktrace gives you a good starting point, but as someone who has struggled with this type of installation before, it's unfortunately not sufficient.\r\n\r\nIf you do decide to venture down the `Cygwin` path, let me know if you have any questions."
