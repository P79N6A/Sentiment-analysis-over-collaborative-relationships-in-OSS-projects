Maybe it can be used as an advantage to the user, to use that name instead, if he/she doesn't like backtick quoting. \r\n\r\nAnyway, there are a few ways we can do something about it. \r\n\r\n * Make clash less likely \r\n\r\nSo, if we use a suffix like: `_SPECIAL_BACKTICK_QUOTED_SUFFIX`, I think it is unlikely this will cause any problems in the real world. It is also most easy and elegant to implement. I only change this in the common.py function. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe problem with really solving is, that is complete ambiguity, is that when we are in the parser, we don't have access to the column names anymore. The column names are somewhere in a DeepChainMap in a Scope object and I don't know how and if we can extract only the column names from this DeepChainMap, since a lot more has been added to it. I can try to reverse engineer this process, but if the process is altered, it will break. Not worth it. So we can do:\r\n\r\n * Bring the parser logic to the api level\r\nOnly when we are at the eval function of the DataFrame we have correct access to the collumn names and can perform a non-ambiguous replacement of the back quoted string. \r\n\r\n * Bring a class with the column names all into the parser \r\nWe can bring a class containing the column names all the way to the parser.

Backticks are not likely to occur normally in those queries. \r\n\r\nBut if we want it to be based on tokenization of a quoted expression, it is a bit more tricky. Tokenization is done by python's own tokenization function and that will split the backtick quoted string into multiple tokens. \r\n\r\nThere are two ways to still make this happen. \r\n\r\n * Write some logic around Python's tokenization that catches a backtick and appends all following tokens to it. Still a bit a hack. \r\n\r\n * Fork Python's tokenization method and add support for backtick quoted strings. Shouldn't be too difficult to adjust since it already can detect normally quoted strings, but you pull in a lot of code and all changes to that method in the Python core than has to be manually applied to the Pandas tokenization method. Also, I don't know how simple that is to make Python2 compatible, but maybe I don't have to?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI can change the test to use the fixtures and add some more mixed cases, but what does IOW mean?"

One by one. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think I can write some kind of wrapper around Python's tokenizer to catch backtick quoted strings. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI don't think a uuid will help. Eventually numexpr needs to receive valid Python identifiers, so I think a more complex suffix will be enough to prevent clashes. This would than be the same as how @ is replaced by local variables. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSince changing the approach to the tokenizer instead is a different approach, is it okay that I make a different pull request for that?"
