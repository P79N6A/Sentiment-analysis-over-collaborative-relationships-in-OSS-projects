Let's be clear about lifecycle for NDFrame:\n\n`__new__` --> not used (just object's `__new__`)\n`__init__` --> called to reconstruct object, no access to metadata of previous\n`__finalize__` --> called after `__init__` is done initializing after things like arithmetic, sorting, and slicing that generate either same type _or_ constructorsliced?\n\nSo if you do `df[\"A\"]`, would that call `__finalize__`? what about `df.loc` or other structures like that? (or the methods that promote upwards)?\n\n`__init__` doesn't return anything, should `__finalize__` return self?\n"

More will likely be defined in future versions of Python.
