FWIW you will get different results when running for one module vs for an entire project and then grepping for the module in question. Have you tried the latter and was that any more useful? If so, any other thoughts or ideas here?"

As a bonus, its results can be improved by just writing missing tests.\r\n\r\nIf Vulture had awareness of the API it would at least help us identify undocumented parts of it, but unless I'm mistaken, it just considers \"dead\" any part of the API that is not used in the codebase itself. Using tests as \"whitelist\", assuming it is possible, could marginally improve the results."
