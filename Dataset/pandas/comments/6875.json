Already looking good, just some comments. \nIf you address them, you amend the commit and then push force again (`git push -f origin`), and the PR will automatically update.\n\nBTW, we always recommend to make a seperate branch for a PR (so you don't work on the master branch). It's OK for now, but if you would contribute more in the future, it's better to commit changes directly to master. \n\nIf you have further questions, just ask!\n"

In a PR, just make sure that the new code for the contribution or the fix follows PEP8, but for cleaning up other code we like to do this seperate and at certain moments (to keep history and git blame cleaner, and to not get too much conflicts with other PRs). \nAnd furthermore, it also makes it more difficult to review this PR (to see what is really changed).\n\nSo could you seperate the actual fix and tests here? \n\nBut for the branch, like @cpcloud said, you are correct. Normally this is also what github will propose by default.\n"
