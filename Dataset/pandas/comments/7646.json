    "body": "I finally had the time to debug this. And yes, it was my code that had the bug. Instead of a filename, my script somehow ended up passing an empty list as the first argument to `df.to_hdf`. That's why pytables.py indeed ends up effectively calling `[].append()` on line 277. The input arguments should have been the first things for me to recheck, silly me.\n\nWhat still somewhat bothers me is how little help there was from the error message. What my script passed to `df.to_hdf` was complete nonsense, but the first thing to throw an error was a builtin that had been accidentally called in an inappropriate place. Is this just the price to pay for using a language with dynamic data types or should there be some checks for the input arguments?\n\nAnyway, everything is solved for me now. Thank you jreback for tirelessly trying to help me!\n"

In python it is better ask forgiveness (e.g. raise an error, which it did). a list is a string-like after all (not a useful one, but that's a different issue).\n"
