Maybe something was changed or improved to work better, and I was doing it in a fashion that would be 'old' or deprecated.  All I know is that the uncommented way above was working.  Not a big deal - I expect to have to update code as it improves if that is the case - I was just wondering if I had a bug or not.\n\nThanks!\n"

They are just not designed for this, and its quite inefficient. What are you trying to do?\n\nThis is inefficient because everything is stored as object dtype (their is no other way). You need to directly store the data; a frame is a 2-d container. If yoou need more dimensions use a Panel or a Panel4D.\n"

I do have the data analysis book though - it really is a neat tool.  Anyway, thanks for the FYI.  I need to rethink how I am doing things - it would probably clean up a lot of my code as well.\n"
