    "body": "I just had a brief look, and it seems that `merge_asof` uses `_AsOfMerge` which in turns uses `_OrderedMerge`. The latter already has the `fill_method` argument (see [here](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/core/reshape/merge.py#L1173)) but only `ffill` and `None` values are implemented. It seems that the most straightforward way to implement interpolation would be to do it for `_OrderedMerge`. Pros of doing it this way is we would also get interpolation for `merge_ordered` which currently only has `ffill`. Cons is that this small change would affect multiple functions. What do you think?\r\n\r\nAlso, hypothetically, what would this entail exactly? Do the change above, plus write tests, plus write the docs for `merge_asof`, `merge_ordered`, and all affected functions. Anything else?"
