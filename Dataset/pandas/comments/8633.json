But nevertheless I think my point is a bit different in the sense that I suggest to have a rather simple generic fallback mechanism whenever there is no dedicated backend support.\n\nYes, of course explicit conversion works, but since that is the natural generic approach, why not applying something like that internally as last resort instead of throwing NotImplemented?\n\nWould love to contribute, but barely have time to report issues.\n"

NotImplemented it just an explicit stop-gap until it can work. Its how a not implemented feature is signaled to the user.\n\nDo appreciate the issues report. Serialization was pushed to later for lack of time. \n\nSo this is the same issue (as I don't think degradation is worth it, and it just hides it from the user, which is not good).\n"
