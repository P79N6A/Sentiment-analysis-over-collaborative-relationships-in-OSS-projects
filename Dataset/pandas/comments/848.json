    "body": "Haven't thought about it before. Can you elaborate on your use case at all? From reading the R doc, looks like it attaches additional information to measured variables, eg if you have a factor HML you can cross-reference this as referring to \"High Medium Low\". Does it allow, for instance, enriching factor labels like \"H\" => \"greater than 1.0\"?  I can see that being very useful.\n"

    "body": "Yes, it does allow for enriching factor labels.\n\nFor a given AnnotatedDataFrame adf, the metadata (say, annot) is itself a data frame where rownames(annot)=colnames(adf). annot can have an arbitrary number of columns, but it must have one called 'labelDescription\", containing a description of each variable. In your example, this column could have the textual description, say, \"H=greater than 1.0//M=1.0//L=less than 1.0\", or the description could be spread out over multiple columns.\n\nI don't have a specific use case, but I have found these annotations very useful in R because most data come along with relevant methods-type descriptions of how they were derived.\n"
