    "body": "> It might be even more convenient if pandas would detect the presence of pandas-io and import all new formats automatically.\n\nThis is an intriguing idea, and certainly would be a win for interactive use. And I really like supporting method chaining. But there are a few tradeoffs to consider here:\n1. I don't see anyway to add methods like `to_root` dynamically (e.g., only if ROOT is installed) without triggering potentially expensive imports (#9482) at import time for pandas.\n2. It's slightly un-Pythonic to have implicit imports from different modules. On the other hand, adding methods to `pandas.DataFrame` when root pandas is imported is also not very explicit.\n3. The bigger issue is that injected methods are hard to discover or track down if they're not in pandas itself. At the very least, users expect that DataFrame methods should be documented in our API docs.\n\nConsidering these factors, it seems like creating stubs like `to_root` in pandas itself would be ideal. We could outsource the actual implementation to `pandas-io` or whatever, and refer to those external sources in the pandas documentation. `pandas-io` could even replace entirely generic stubs like `DataFrame.to_root(*args, **kwargs)` with an appropriate signature at import time.\n"

I only think we should first more thoroughly discuss it (and exploring it can help the discussion).\n\nVery quickly some ideas:\n\nPro:\n- discoverability (only one package to install, and there you can see options with tab completion)\n- more uniformity between external io providers\n- ...\n\nCon:\n- harder to maintain, less ownership as with separate packages (of course, we can have maintainer per subpackage)\n- different subpackages of varying quality (what if the maintainer of one of the io providers is not active anymore?)\n- installing multiple packages is not that hard anymore these days\n- ...\n\nIf discoverability is the main reason, I think there are also other ways to handle this (better promoting ecosystem packages in the docs, website, add it to the io docs, ..)\n"
