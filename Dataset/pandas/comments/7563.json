This is well doced and the error message is appropriate. What are you suggesting?\n"

    "body": "I agree that there are two changes - but they stem from common underlying concerns.\n\nI was also confused - I thought a general shift to allow disabling regex compilation was enabled in `pandas.core.strings`. But for example, `str_replace` still uses this logic:\n\n``` python\nuse_re = not case or len(pat) > 1 or flags\n```\n\nI agree that the behavior of read_csv is well documented and the error mesage is appropriate for, e.g., read_csv. (That said, the docs are a bit hard to navigate for newcomers... but that's a _totally_ separate issue.) But the reasoning about efficiency and \"least surprisingness\" applies just as well here, I think. In particular, a single multi-byte unicode character triggers the switch to regexps, which is inefficient (and confusing to a newbie).\n\nThe auto-regexp-conversion logic seems parallel, and seems like a high-level design decision that should be applied across the library. And as you can see from the above, the high-level discussion ends up being more far reaching than I thought (there are several functions like str_replace that still only have auto-regexp). \n\nIn particular, I absolutely DO NOT want to change `str_contains` to stick with string matching by default, while other `core.string` functions continue to auto-convert patterns to regexps. Consistency is more valuable than one function being more efficient / less surprising.\n\nBut let me know if I should split the issue! As I said, these aren't hard changes, and I'm happy to do pull request(s).\n"

    "body": "ok, so let's split this issue.\n\n In this one why don't you put checkboxes in the top for those functions that need changing the default to `regex=False` (most in strings, but maybe not all)\n\nIf I read you correctly, then you are saying that a `multi-BYTE` character triggers python mode. This could be a limitation of the C-parser which doesn't just works on the encoded bytes (and so multi-byte appears as more than 1 character). It is pretty non-trivial to use a multi-character separate in the parser (that said it _could_ be implemented). related : https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/2667, related: https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/7470 \n"
