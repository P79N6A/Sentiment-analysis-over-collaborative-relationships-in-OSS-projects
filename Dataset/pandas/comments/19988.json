I'm not sure.\r\n\r\n> How do we avoid developer bias when forming benchmarks?\r\n\r\nIf everyone's contributing it'll cancel out, right? :)\r\n\r\n> Does anyone have enthusiasm about working on this?\r\n\r\nI can start something after the pandas 0.23 release in a few weeks."

Do you have any interest in expanding those benchmarks to alternative implementations (ray, dask, spark)?  Some of these could complicate the setup code a decent amount, so \"no\" is a perfectly fine answer. Would you mind including a license in your repo, so that we can re-use pieces with credit back to the original (and because that's good OSS practice)?"
