    "body": "I think i sorted out what the problem is here.  pivot_table calls unstack on a DataFrame, passing a level argument.  When the argument is an int, then unstack assumes (reasonably so) that this is an index, not a level name.\n\nI tried to hack in a fix in\nhttps://github.com/dieterv77/pandas-1/commit/8e7b69a84c18d55d661efd3670ff202ef135066a\nI don't know the internals well enough to know if this fix is appropriate, but if someone thinks it is, i can open a pull request.\n"
