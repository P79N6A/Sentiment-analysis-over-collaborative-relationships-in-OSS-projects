    "body": "I've started digging deeper into the failing tests and realised this is a bit more complicated than I expected, and my understanding of Pandas internals might be limiting here - any comments are welcome.\n\nWhat I can see now:\n- On some code paths making sure that the MI is lexsorted to at least the selection depth is enforced, otherwise a KeyError is raised (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/indexes/multi.py#L1823)\n- On some code paths selection from an unsorted MI is supported, as a linear search algorithm is implemented, and a PerformanceWarning is raised to notify the user about possible consquences (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/indexes/multi.py#L1575). However I believe there is also a bug here, as the warning raised says \"PerformanceWarning: indexing past lexsort depth may impact performance.\", but it is not raised if the MultiIndex is not lexsorted, it is raised if the MI is not unique.\n- On some code paths no check is performed, and the execution ends up in Cython land, where it fails (this is what I originally wanted to correct) (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/indexes/multi.py#L1686, https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/index.pyx#L137)\n\nMy current implementation simply enforces the first, stricter rule, but this means that code that previously ran fine (with or without a PerformanceWarning) now raises a KeyError, which is not really nice. (This is why some of the other tests failed.)\n\nA bit of a guidance would be much appreciated on which solution you prefer, especially if you want me to add the linear-search thing to the currently failing code paths as well.\n\nAs an additional note, is it too far-fetched to suggest that the index should be automatically sorted if lexsort_depth < len(key) instead of raising these errors? I think paying attention to all this is pretty annoying from an end-user perspective without any real benefits - if I want to select, I need to sort anyway, so why bother? I assume the reason for not doing this is to avoid implicitly changing the data structures without the user noticing it, right?\n"

Leave this for now, having a partially lex-sorted index is not easy to create and normally won't be, so its a minor issue IMHO.\n3) yes this would be nice to catch this case with a `NonLexsortedMultiIndexError`.\n\nThe reason for the lexsortedness is that you might have to potentially re-order something which you may not want to do. Thus it is up to the user. The basic problem is if someone is doing something which removes the sortedness, and doing this in iteratively (of course this is bad), then forcing a sort EACH time is really bad. \n\nSo its kind of a: I will do the best I can showing a warning when needed, but if perf matters AND you are doing iterative indexing (which you shouldn't be anyhow), then it is up to the user to make it sorted.\n\nIf you have a good usecase that doesn't fall into this pattern lmk.\n\nBTW, this is basically the same issue of \"when to recompute the levels\".\n"

However I am afraid that fixing 3) means that the same tests that were failing in the last build will be still failing, as those are the cases where the PerfWarning was shown previously, so this would be a partially backwards-compatibility-breaking change.\n\nAs for making autosort the default: maybe it could be an option, which could even be used in an option context, with which you could disable the automatic sorting behaviour - if you are doing something iteratively where performance matters and sorting hurts, you can disable it as an optimisation. For everyone else, especially novices, understanding an unnecessary exception was saved. We for example work quite a lot with small datasets, where sorting would probably not be noticeable, and we frequently find ourselves getting these errors due to forgetting sorting (for example after merging different datasets).\n\n(Btw I am amazed by your response speed..)\n"
