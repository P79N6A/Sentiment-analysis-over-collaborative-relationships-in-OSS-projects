    "body": "Thanks again for the ideas.\n\nBy they way, the way I figured this out was that when I used a file handle, the error message was helpful:\n`pandas.parser.CParserError: Error tokenizing data. C error: Calling read(nbytes) on source failed. Try engine='python'.`\n\nI found that using `engine='python'` fixed the problem using either the file handle or file path. Is it feasible to change to error message from the when read_csv is used with a file path to include the `engine='python'` suggestion?\n"
