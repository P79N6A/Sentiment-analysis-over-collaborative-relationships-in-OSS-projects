Once, those cases are merged to master I'll rebase and update this PR. I've added `test_excel.py` tests on a separate branch and they pass local and TravisCI tests.\n"

I recall you saying something about that in regards to performance. (and then just pass additional keyword arguments to `write_cells`, etc.)\n"
