    "body": "The reason for that is because we used the wrong links in that announcement. It should be http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.20/whatsnew.html instead of http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.20.0/whatsnew.html, and that link should work fine normally.\r\n\r\nThe reason we didn't update it is because then the sha256 hash of the zip archives of the release also change. Although, since there is already 0.20.1, it would probably not give much problems to update the links now (@TomAugspurger ok to change?)\r\n\r\n"
