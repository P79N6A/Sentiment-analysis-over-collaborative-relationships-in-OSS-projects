    "body": "> I am not aware of a general existing contains method for Index ? \r\n\r\nThere is a [`contains` ](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Index.contains.html)method for `Index`: \r\n```python\r\nIn [2]: idx = pd.Index(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])\r\n\r\nIn [3]: idx.contains('foo')\r\nOut[3]: True\r\n\r\nIn [4]: idx.contains('a')\r\nOut[4]: False\r\n```\r\n\r\n> IMO it would be unfortunate that index.iv.contains and index.contains did something completely different.\r\n\r\nNote that this already happens with the string accessor:\r\n```python\r\nIn [5]: idx.str.contains('a')\r\nOut[5]: array([False,  True,  True], dtype=bool)\r\n```\r\nI do see your point though, and am not trying to imply that this would be fine simply because there is precedence for it.

I was thinking about the `dt` and `cat` accessors. But you are right, neither precedent necessarily needs to determine what we think best for IntervalIndex.\r\n\r\n> The entire point of introducing .contains was to avoid conflating a very well-defined behavior for `__contains__` (generally);\r\n\r\nI don't fully understand this point, as Index.contains is (more or less) an exact alias for `__contains__` for most index types. Apart for IntervalIndex, where it does something slightly different (not a pure `__contains__`), and this difference in behaviour of `.contains` between all indices and IntervalIndex is also confusing IMO. \r\nI somehow like the fact that you can also do a 'contains' operation with a method instead of `key in index`, but it adds a duplicate method which is not available for something else (as the behaviour proposed here)\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "I don't agree with closing this :-), but it is true the discussion died.\r\n\r\nLet me summarize my reasoning for this PR:\r\n\r\n- Currenlty `Index.contains(key)` does the same as `Index.__contains__(key)` / `key in index`. This is therefore duplicating functionality that is IMO not needed (in other PRs we are actively removing methods).\r\n- For all index types `.contains()` currenlty does an \"exact search\" of the label, `IntervalIndex` does not (also checks if passed values is contained in any of the individual values of the index), making this method inconsistent between index types.\r\n- The proposed `IntervalIndex.contains` is an element-wise version of the 'contains' operation on an individual `Interval` object (curently `val in Interval()`, but we could also add a `Interval.contains()` method).\r\n- I don't know of other interval-like implementations that have something like this that we could use as reference, but in spatial topology this predicate is called \"contains\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DE-9IM, although the rules for the edges are a bit unintuitive, and you could also say the equivalent is \"covers\"). \r\n\r\nSo my proposal is:\r\n\r\n- Remove (deprecate) `.contains()` for all other Index types\r\n- Only keep it for `IntervalIndex` and change it here to work element-wise\r\n\r\nAnd also if we do not agree on the above, I think we need the *functionality* of this PR, so then we need to come up with another name than `.contains()` (and then \"covers\" might be reasonable one, although I find \"contains\" more logical).\r\n\r\n"
