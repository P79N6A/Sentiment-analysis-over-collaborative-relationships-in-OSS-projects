    "body": "On a closer look, it appears that the behavior is correct but misleading.  `QuarterEnd(startingMonth=2)` is an offset for quarters that start on Feb 1, May 1, Aug 1, Nov 1.  I assumed that `QuarterEnd(startingMonth=2)` would be an offset corresponding to the ends of those same quarters.  That is incorrect.  `QuarterEnd(startingMonth=2)` is an offset for quarters that end on Feb 2[89], May 31, Aug 31, Nov 30.\r\n\r\nI'm not the first to make this mistake or otherwise end up confused:\r\n- #5307  Parameter Name of startingMonth for QuarterEnd is Misleading\r\n- #8435 DEPR: QuarterBegin and BQuarterBegin return days that are not quarter beginnings\r\n- #17787 DOC: Anchored Offset Starting Quarter and Year defaults to JAN not DEC\r\n- #2885 Default for \"Q\" is not the same default for QuarterEnd\r\n\r\nI suggest the following:\r\n- `startingMonth` should be replaced with something non-camelCase anyway, so let's take the opportunity to replace a problematic kwarg with a clear one.\r\n- Just brainstorming here: `q1start_month=2` means Q1 begins Feb1 and ends Apr 30 (\\pm business days)\r\n- Methods of the form `to_qtr_end`, `to_qtr_business_begin`, `to_year_end` (hopefully its obvious what they would do).\r\n\r\nThoughts?  I'm happy to implement+test, but would like to get buy-in first."
