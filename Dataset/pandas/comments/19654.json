    "body": "@TomAugspurger that's why my suggestion was to look up whether to call it, before calling it. Not sure about performance, though - isinstance() seems to take some time. Perhaps @asmeurer's suggestion is simpler (and better-performing from the Pandas side), but that would indeed require those classes becoming \"pandas-aware\" to some degree. With registration, you could register in third-party code (e.g. a compat library, or even just as a user, with something like `pd.register_uncallable(sympy.ManagedProperties)`). pandas would ideally start looking up only when there was at least a single registered class, to minimize performance impact for users who don't need this functionality."
