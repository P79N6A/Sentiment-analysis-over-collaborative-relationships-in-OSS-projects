    "body": "It's not surprising that **modifying** a frame while trying to use it from multiple threads is unsafe, but it's kind of weird that \"read only\" operations like `is_unique` can break. In my experience at least, this race in `Index` is the only part of Pandas that seems to go wrong when using a DataFrame in a read-only fashion from several threads. I guess there might be a few other initialised caches hanging around other parts of the codebase though."
