    "body": "I know it may seem a little strange, but pandas actually uses NaN intentionally in string arrays, as a marker for missing values. The pandas [string methods](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/text.html) will skip NaN, and likewise we use it for methods like `isnull`, `fillna` and `dropna`.\n\nIf you'd like to replace them with another value, try `df.fillna('')`.\n"
