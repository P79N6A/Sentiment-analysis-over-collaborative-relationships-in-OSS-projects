    "body": "After a bit more poking at Rs factors, I think labels there are kind of waste of time: I think changing levels in R will do renaming/reducing/appending of levels. It seems labels are simple there to change the names of the levels in one go during creation of a factor, but that can also be done afterwards with changing the levels. So I'm fine with that change back from pointers to labels, although I still find it strange, as from my (German, so non-English) POV labels are \"names for something\", so actually I would have expected the other end to be the labels (\"pointers point to labels\").\n\nin R, a categorical is always strings (so the first thing would be to convert values to strings), but I think we can miss that.\n\nAnyway, I think the main part missing is a API which reorders/reduces/expand levels based on an input array/list and renaming of levels:\n\n```\nc = Series(Categorical([1,2,3,4,1], levels=[1,2,3,4])\n# all following examples would operate on this one...\nc.labels == [0,1,2,3,0]\nc.levels = [1,2,3,4] \nc.get_values() == [1,2,3,4,1] \n# reorder would basically replace the levels and do a replace on the pointers/labels so that they point to the same 'levels' (or in my speak 'labels')\nc.reorder([4,3,2,1]) # all \"pointers\" to '4' must be changed from 3 to 0,...\nc.labels == [3,2,1,0,3] # positions are changed\nc.levels == [4,3,2,1] # levels are now in new order\nc.get_values() == [1,2,3,4,1] # output is the same\nc.min() == 4\nc.max() = 1\n# assigning to levels would simple exchange the levels array\nc.levels = [4,3,2,1] \nc.labels == [0,1,2,3,0]\nc.levels == [4,3,2,1] \nc.get_values() == [4,3,2,1,4] \nc.min() == 4\nc.max() = 1\n# assigning a longer array will add a level \nc.levels = [4,3,2,1,0] \nc.labels == [0,1,2,3,0]\nc.levels == [4,3,2,1,0] \nc.get_values() == [4,3,2,1,4] \nc.min() == 4\nc.max() = 0\nc.levels = [4,3,\"a\",2,1] \nc.labels == [0,1,2,3,0]\nc.levels == [4,3,\"a\",2,1] \nc.get_values() == [4,3,\"a\",2,4] \n# assigning a shorter array will make that values NA\nc.levels = [4,3,2] \nc.labels == [0,1,2,NA,0]\nc.levels == [4,3,2] \nc.get_values() == [4,3,2,NA,4] \n# assigning a NA level could do two things: make that value NA or the level would be NA\n# I would vote for the latter, as otherwise we would need to check each new level for NAs...\nc.levels = [4,3,2, NA] \nc.labels == [0,1,2,3,0]\nc.levels == [4,3,2, NA] \nc.get_values() == [4,3,2,NA,4] \n```\n\nI also think that operations based on categorical levels (groupby, etc) should return groups for all levels and not only the ones, which have values -> empty groups for levels without values.\n"

This is also something that should be discussed broader I think (with more people who would use this, send it out to the list), but it is now difficult to engage in the discussion with only the code to look at and the discussion in this PR.\n\nHaving an overview with the reasoning behind this new type, the naming, the API, how you create it, how to do common operations on it, how it behaves in other pandas methods, some examples of applications, (maybe a short comparison with R), ... could be beneficial for making this a more solid enhancement, but also to facilitate the dicussion (and afterwards this can be used as a start for some documentation, so certainly not 'wasted' in that regard).\n\nJust a remark from the sideline. What do you think? \n@JanSchulz Would you be able to start something like that?\n"

Most of this already exists in the tests. Just really need an extended example with commentary that can turn into docs directly. So pretend I am reading the doc sections, and come across *Working with Categorical``. \n- So, I want to start with some data\n- convert to Categoricals (`cut`); and use the constructor directly.\n- put in a DataFrame (with some other data).\n- order / select values (direct selection, `min/max`)\n- setting (this is really tricky; most pandas operations return copies so have to be very very careful about mutability here)\n- grouping\n\nThe main question I have is, you have created a Categorical, what/how/when do you use it?\n"

    "body": "I kind of agree with @jorisvandenbossche.\n\nCategoricals may well exist as of now, but they felt like sort of \"there-be-dragons\" feature to me, like you must know what you do around them. That's not always bad, because it means there's no guarantee for backward compatibility and thus your hands are untied if you see something _really_ wrong with the API.  If we are to \"legalize\" them letting them into the \"public\" section of the API, this will severely limit the future opportunities to make amends if any of the tentative decisions prove wrong.\n\nHence I'd suggest the design decisions to be laid out in plain sight to be examined by anyone interested. Actual code and comments are less useful in this regard because it's not always clear if this or that was intended or was it just never considered. Examples/cookbooks are better but add some rationales and you've got yourself an almost proper PEP (see https://github.com/cython/cython/wiki/enhancements for example).\n\nI'd also love the first versions of the soon-to-be-public API to \"boil\" in experimental mode for a while to be able to play with them and see if the decisions work out without hasting to make it before 0.14.1.\n"

Beyond that, just being able to hand off a DataFrame that contains one to a statistical model and have it be recognized as a Categorical will be nice. Patsy does some of this already (for string/object types), but if you don't go through the formula api of statsmodels there's no easy way to do this. It will also be a nice feature to be able to associate a particular contrast with a categorical variable. So some kind of container for meta-data or attribute might be appropriate here.\n\nhttp://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/zC.html\n\n+1 for a PEP and more mailing list/community discussion.\n"

Specifically my use case here is that people want to specify how a given set of levels should be encoded when used in a statistical model, so the information should be \"attached\" to the levels: see the examples involving `Poly` and `ContrastMatrix` here: http://patsy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/categorical-coding.html\n- I think \"labels\" is a terribly confusing name for the underlying integers, please don't use this :-(.
