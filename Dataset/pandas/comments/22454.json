The docs don't say what version that warning was added in, but later on that page it suggests that the feature was available in 0.20.0 (...

    "body": "Yeah, but my concern is if bugs in pandas' behaviour originates from Cython, then we might get situations where:\r\n* pandas 0.24 requires cython 0.28.2+\r\n* pandas 0.24.1 requires cython 0.28.6+ (because of a bug in cython 0.28.5)\r\n* pandas 0.24.2 requires cython 0.29 (a bug in Cython 0.28.6...)\r\n* etc.\r\n\r\nwhich would be annoying and maybe a bit unstable. This could also happen from other bugs in cython, but the risk is probably greater for the fused API because it is declared not bug-free by the cython team...\r\n\r\nI don't have the ability to make a recommendation on this, but take it as a thing to consider and check for.

We here at `pandas` were planning on using them in place of `tempita` for some of our source code as you can see in this PR.  However, there's a note in the [docs](http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/userguide/fusedtypes.html) from >5 years ago (at least according to the commit history) regarding the instability of fused types.  Is this still the case?\r\n\r\nHappy to formally open an issue if that is preferred (this is more of a usage question, hence the \"cold\" mention for lack of a better term).  Thanks!"
