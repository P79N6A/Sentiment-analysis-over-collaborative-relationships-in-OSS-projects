    "body": "@cpcloud it probably should be a style convention going forward to avoid using character codes in favor of the clearer, more verbose names.\n\nFor example, this previously had two separate conditional branches that did:\n\n``` python\nif cond1:\n    lvalues.astype('i8')\n    rvalues.astype('i8')\nelif cond2:\n    lvalues.astype(np.int64)\n    rvalues.astype(np.int64)\n```\n\nWritten like the above, it's harder to see they do the same thing and can be combined.\n\nI'd also argue that dtypes like `m8[ns]` and `M8[ns]` should be written as `timedelta64[ns]`and `datetime64[ns]` respectively. Much clearer that way.\n"

(much easier to tweak with the split out commits).  Plus, the Series arithmetic method is now much cleaner.\n\nAfter this is finished, will be much easier to do the ops refactor.\n"
