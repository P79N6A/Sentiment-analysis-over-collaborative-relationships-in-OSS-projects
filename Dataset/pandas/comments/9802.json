We should think carefully about what we can guarantee this and in any case include a warning against using _other_ internal methods. Perhaps we should explicitly label this subclassing API as \"experimental\" (we reserve the right to break it in the future if necessary).\n2. **We should encourage using composition instead of inheritance when possible.** This is a good opportunity to point out that the Index class, in particular, has a well defined API. For example of using composition with the pandas.Index to enable label based indexing, you could point users to [xray](http://github.com/xray/xray).\n"
