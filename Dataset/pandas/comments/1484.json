    "body": "Sorry for the slow turn-around responding to this. Thanks for taking a look.\n\nUnfortunately, `mlines.lineMarkers` is not used by `scatter()`, so this compatibility function doesn't get the test to pass with matplotlib 1.0.1. I'll see if I can come up with a non-awful way to do the compatibility check, but it probably won't be in time to sneak into 0.8.0.\n\nAt least [the maintainer update bug](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=166329) was closed and matplotlib 1.1.0 finally [made it into the FreeBSD ports tree](http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/cvs-ports/2012-June/245532.html), so the consequence is attenuated.\n"
