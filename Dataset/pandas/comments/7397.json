    "body": "I'm not sure this is a good idea since Stata doesn't support any unsigned data types.  In particular some of the code which uses the numpy datatypes in this commit will result in data loss.  \n\nThe only place where uint\\* handling should be added is in the casting code.  Once the columns have been cast to supported Stata datatypes then only the supported Stata datatypes should be used when writing the Stata data types (e.g. `char(253)`)\n"
