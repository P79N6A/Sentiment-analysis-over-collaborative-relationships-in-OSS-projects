    "body": "@SirWillae : Thanks for report!  I think this is to be expected.  The maximum `uint8` in `numpy` is `255` (you can see for yourself by calling (`np.iinfo(np.uint8).max`).  This is type promotion on `numpy`'s end IINM.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, I don't think there's anything weird going on.  Closing as a result, but if you find evidence to the contrary, feel free to comment back, and we can revisit."
