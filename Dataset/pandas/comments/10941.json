Just be sure to start your branch from the latest upstream master. Rebasing your branch is only needed once there are conflicts because other people have changed the same file. Which is not the case here at all.\n- To start a new branch from upstream master, just do:\n  \n  ```\n  git checkout master\n  git fetch upstream\n  git merge --ff-only upstream/master\n  git checkout -b new_branch\n  ```\n- When you need to rebase (which will probably not be the case here if you did like above), simply do the following:\n  \n  ```\n  git fetch upstream\n  git checkout new_branch\n  git rebase upstream/master\n  ```\n  \n  and this should almost always work.\n\nDon't close this PR, just try to clean up this branch and force push. To clean this up, do exactly the following:\n\n```\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout merging\ngit rebase -i upstream/master\n# then in overview of commits, remove all commits apart from the last one 'updating the docs' (the only commit with the actual changes I think), and leave that one as 'pick'\ngit push -f origin merging\n```\n\nIf you do exactly as above, this should be fine\n"
