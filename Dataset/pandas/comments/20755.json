    "body": "Hi @jorisvandenbossche, thanks for the quick reply. I appreciate your feedback. \r\n\r\nI agree that `gantt` sounds very specialized, and open to name it something else,  but would argue that it forms the **basis** for several types of plots which build on it:\r\n\r\n* event type, or **raster plot**, i.e. anything that basically has a start and end time (or duration). Used a lot in medical applications: \r\n<img width=\"464\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-04-20 at 16 06 48\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3731173/39058866-e99bb2ee-44b4-11e8-8631-0a7a6e500491.png\">\r\n\r\nMore images https://www.google.com/search?q=raster+plot+neuron&tbm=isch\r\n* **waterfall** plots used a lot in personal finance or performance analysis:\r\n<img width=\"592\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-04-20 at 16 13 04\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3731173/39059223-d0ba185a-44b5-11e8-93c3-8ea1d71c9c13.png\">\r\nor\r\n<img width=\"438\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-04-20 at 16 14 05\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3731173/39059250-e3ce0f1e-44b5-11e8-890e-621935ad9a99.png\">\r\n\r\nMore images https://www.google.com/search?q=waterfall+plot+horizontal&tbm=isch\r\n\r\n----\r\nI can assure the PR will follow the **contribution guidelines** and the implementation will revolve around the matplotlib functions, i.e. no quirky/weird options/arguments, or messy design. The implementation will not include all those additional lines/coloring/shades and all the plot needs in terms of data are:\r\n* labels\r\n* start points\r\n* end points (or durations)\r\n\r\nAlso, there is already **interest** in the idea, as it has been accepted as a project for the [Man AHL hackaton](https://www.ahl.com/hackathon). I truly believe gantt/event plots are really powerful visuals and have a range of applications, not all of them fully exploited, but they have unnecessary barriers to entry from a plotting perpective. It should not take 20 lines of code to plot something based off labels, start/end times! \r\n\r\nFinally, googling gantt + python either shows:\r\n* paid solutions/software, \r\n* plotly, different ecosystem and requires subscirption to keep plots private\r\n* python-gantt 0.6.0 on pypy, which outputs svg, and is not mantained since 2016\r\n* answers on blogs, stackoverflow etc... all requiring those 20 lines of code that leverage matplotlib\r\n\r\n\r\n"
