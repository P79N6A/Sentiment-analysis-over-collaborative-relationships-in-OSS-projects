    "body": "A Panel supports a multiindex only on the first axis (items). So if you have only a single axis with a multiindex, you can swapaxes() to get it there. But that's hokey. What if more than one axis has a multiindex? Or you want to be able to update() along a multiindex (update() works only along the major_axis)? Why not allow all axes to have multindex, and then under-the-hood replace any multinindex with an integer index (and restore it/them when reading, obviously), as in my previous comment? Seems reasonably straightforward to me, and would think it wouldn't be hard for someone familiar with the the code and HDF5 (not me :-)).\n"

    "body": "OK, maybe searching along a multiindex is a problem. But simply storing a multiindex shouldn't be. For example, I have a panel with a fixed set of multiindex columns -- and I never need to select a subset of them. Why should I need to swapaxes(0,2) (both when saving and when loading)?\n\nOr better yet, suppose I want to store the panel `p = rolling_cov(df, 10, pairwise=True)`, where `df.columns` is a multiindex, as a table so that I can append() new values as I add rows to `df`. (Again, assume `df.columns` remains fixed, so that `p.major_axis` and `p.minor_axis`, which both equal `df.columns`, remain fixed.) Then first I need to do `p.swapaxes(0,1)` to switch the time axis from `items` to `major_axis` so that I can `append()` along it. OK. But since the 'table' format supports a multiindex on only one axis (items), and here I would have a multiindex along two axes (items and minor_axis, after swapping axes 0 and 1), I believe that currently `p` can't be saved at all using `format='table'`, no matter what axes I swap.\n"
