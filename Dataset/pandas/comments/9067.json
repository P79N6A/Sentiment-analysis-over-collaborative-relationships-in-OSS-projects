    "body": "@mrocklin You have the `skipinitialspace=True` argument for this (it is False by default). This is not specifically for the header, but you can use it for that:\n\n```\nIn [1]: s = \"\"\"name,    amount\n   ...: Alice,100\n   ...: Bob,200\"\"\"\n\nIn [5]: pd.read_csv(StringIO(s)).columns\nOut[5]: Index([u'name', u'    amount'], dtype='object')\n\nIn [6]: pd.read_csv(StringIO(s), skipinitialspace=True).columns\nOut[6]: Index([u'name', u'amount'], dtype='object')\n```\n\nSo your question is more about the default value of `skipinitialspace` (or would you treat columns in another way as the values?)\n"

    "body": "Ah, this resolves my underlying issue.  Thank you for pointing me to the right keyword argument.  I apologize for not being sufficiently thorough.\n\nThe two directions you pointed out both seem like valid questions.  I'll state them again below:\n1.  Should the default value of `skipinitialspace` be set to `True`?\n2.  Should we skip initial spaces by default in columns, even if `skipinitialspace=False`?\n\nI have not personally encountered a dataset where positive answers to both of these questions would have had a negative effect and I have encountered a few where positive answers to these questions would have had a positive one.  Admittedly though I have encountered a small subset of datasets.\n"
