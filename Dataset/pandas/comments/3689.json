    "body": "i kind of don't like the summing strings behavior, but that's just me. here's why: just because the binary operator associated with the reduction (or fold if you are into fp) is defined doesn't mean that the reduction itself makes any sense (e.g., `lambda x, y: 2 * x + 3  * y`, with string input), and in fact the built-in `sum` function is not defined for strings. it's probably too late to change that. i think _not_ raising here is a bit magical, but i think that `(df.T.mean(1) == df.mean()).all()` should be `True` in as many cases as possible. I can't think of any right now where you _wouldn't_ want that to be true.\n"
