    "body": "OK, I thought I read an issue where you decided to maintain 32 bit compatibility because of a perceived importance of the rpi/beagle/other communities. In any event the installation failure derives from the compiler losing its mind when it runs out of memory, and giving a useless error. Adding some temporary swap lets pandas 0.24.2 install fine. Thanks for the support."
