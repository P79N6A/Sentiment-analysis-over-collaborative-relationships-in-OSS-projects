    "body": "Ok, so iirc the problems on the esoteric platforms were solved, at least on SPARC 32+64, if memory serves there was some memory alignment and buffer overflow problems and the fixes were pushed upstream to ujson.\n\nAs for windows, that was indeed a bit of a nightmare, the problems that occurred were intermittent  segmentation faults which were hard to reproduce and pin down, and I neither had the windows tools or experience to debug it thoroughly. Here's what I concluded at the time (EPD = Enthought Python Distribution):\n\n> With an independent version of mingw -> no segmentation faults. Compiled a python debug version on win32 and compiled numpy and pandas using EPD's mingw -> no segmentation faults. From the little bit of a stack trace I've been able to get it appears that the problem occurs when ujson calls numpy C-API functions (take that with a healthy dose of salt however as the stack trace also looked pretty corrupted.)\n\nI think the problem occurred when mixing VS compiled ujson and mingw compiled numpy, but it will take more investigation to know for sure. Ideally it would be great if someone with a proper windows setup could take a look, but maybe having it in pandas but disabled might motivate some brave soul...\n\nOn another note I think there have been some minor fixes and enhancements to ujson since it was last merged with pandasjson. Once / if pandasjson is re-included in mainline pandas I'll see about merging them in and send a pull request through?\n\nBTW the extension should work fine in Python 3.x too, or are there some issues I'm not aware of?\n"
