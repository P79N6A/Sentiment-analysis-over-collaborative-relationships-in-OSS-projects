I admit having edtered it a bit in a rush ;-)\r\n\r\n> This would be writing an Excel file where some of the cells are actual formulas?\r\nThe resulting values of a aggregate function would be find.\r\nI do not know if I can create Excel formulas from within pandas.\r\n\r\nThis basic functionality was in a predecessor library:\r\nhttp://pytseries.sourceforge.net/lib.report.html#example-3-html-report\r\n\r\nI will have to check the record if this was discarded by when the timeseries part of pandas was created and functionality was matched against existing pytseries.\r\n\r\nSo yes, adding a footer/header as a formula would be great:\r\nhttps://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/working_with_formulas.html"
