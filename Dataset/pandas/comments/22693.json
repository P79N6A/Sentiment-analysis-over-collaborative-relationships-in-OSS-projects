    "body": "The bug appears to be in [`pandas/io/parsers.py`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/io/parsers.py) in the way [`_remove_empty_lines()`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/0473aab048e43c5bbecd58b1a42b61460ca03518/pandas/io/parsers.py#L2763) is used with fixed-width files (or probably files with whitespace delimiters for that matter). It sees that the line is `['', '']` which in a CSV would mean the string `\",\"` and therefore non-empty, but for a fixed-width file can happen when the line is empty. ~~Arguably, if the line really were spaces out to the last field, empty strings might be the right thing to extract.~~ (Edit: Nevermind, then the fields would be a series of spaces, not empty.) I'm not sure if the right fix is to change `_remove_empty_lines()` or its usages."
