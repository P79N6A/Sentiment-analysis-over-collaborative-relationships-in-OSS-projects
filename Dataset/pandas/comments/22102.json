    "body": "I've got a `DataFrame` and a collection of functions expecting `Series` of various lengths, each returning a `Series`, of potentially different length. I want to chunk the `DataFrame` into various columns, `apply` the appropriate functions, and then rejoin the `DataFrame`.\r\n\r\nFor the most part this works fine, but it gets confused if the function expects a `Series` of length 0.\r\n\r\nThat said, even without the above reason, it seems odd to me to treat the trivial case differently to all other cases. It's just bound to cause weird behaviour in edge cases."
