    "body": "The reason I would rather not do this, is that the tests aren't already that fast, and this will likely slow it down? \nWe could also check for existing tables in the `setUp` after connecting (for case of interruption)?\n\nAbout having the correct database created for users who run the tests, that is indeed a problem. But I think you will have to configure your setup in any case a bit manually. As it is also not that likely that you have the exact same username/password as what is used in the tests. In that case it is not much work to once create the database I think.\n"
