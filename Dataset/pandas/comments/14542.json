In your snippet above you are using the python `sum()` which is indeed unsupported. That's a _different_ error to the one my snippet is generating though.\n\nThe crux of the original error as I understand it is that `numexpr` (?) is trying to call `frozenset()` on an `ndarray` which is indeed unhashable.\n"
