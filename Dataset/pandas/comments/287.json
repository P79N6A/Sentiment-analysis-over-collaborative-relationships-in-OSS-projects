There are two cases:\n- Box plots of each column\n- Box plot of one column, grouped by the values in another\n\nI guess it would make sense to support both of these use cases in a single function. You could imagine a plot with multiple box plots generated off of multiple columns, would be pretty cool\n"

    "body": "Just gave it a spin, this is what i had in mind and looks good.\n\nsome comments:\n- As cswegger mentioned DataFrame.boxplot has no return call (pandas.tools.plotting.boxplot does), when i create boxplots i usually add two horizontal lines on the plot indicating the data boundaries, getting the `ax` as return from boxplot makes this easy. I did not try to use the `ax` input argument.\n- Either i don`t understand the column argument or it has some issues. \n  _repo_/scripts/boxplot_test..py is where i started from:\n  - df.boxplot(by=['indic', 'indic2'], fontsize=8, rot=90) -- works fine, this is what is in the test script\n  - df.boxplot() -- ok\n  - df.boxplot(column=['A']) -- i would expect this would only create a boxplot for column A, but boxplot for all coumns are generated\n  - df.boxplot(by=['indic', 'indic2'], column=['A']) -- i woudl expect a boxplot similar as in the first example, but only for column A, it gives TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n- I mainly use MultiIndex together with DataFrame. The by argument of Dataframe.boxplot works on columns, not on the index, workaround is to use DataFrame.delevel(), but then the indices are also boxplotted (if they hold numeric data). Deleveling also offers possibility to do groupby on multiple levels, which is not (yet :-) )possible on the MultiIndex itself.\n- subplot layout improved (not always using a rectangular layout), which is nice. DataFrame.hist() could benefit from this also.\n"
