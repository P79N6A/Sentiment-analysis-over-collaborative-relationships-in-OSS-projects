    "body": "Yes the nomenclature could probably be a bit confusing. Hadley Wickham introduced `melt` (\"long\") and `cast` (\"wide\") in the `reshape2` package as a more user friendly interface to base R's `reshape`. However, one still have to resort to base R's `reshape` if one have more groups with common \"stubs\" like in `pd.wide_to_long`'s doc string examples.\r\n\r\n`pd.melt` is the functional equivalent, and I think any combination of `unstack`/`reset_index` would mimic `cast`? (and I guess also the right combination of `stack`/`reset_index` would be able to mimic `pd.melt`?)\r\n\r\nIn the Stata camp there is just [reshape](http://www.stata.com/manuals13/dreshape.pdf) which takes an additional direction parameter (`wide` or `long`) and a list of stub names. `pd.wide_to_long` is really just solving the use case mentioned above (where R users have to go back to `reshape`) by mimicking the Stata approach. \r\n\r\nSo in a \"taxonomy of reshapes\", `pd.wide_to_long` is just a special case of `pd.melt`, perhaps `melt_stubs`? : P\r\n"
