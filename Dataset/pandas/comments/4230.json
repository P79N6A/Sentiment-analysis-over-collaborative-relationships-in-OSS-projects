    "body": "I agree with @rockg, the answer given shifts the times, as it parses local timestamps in `'US/Eastern'` as `'UTC'` first (they are not) and then converts these times back to local. This, obviously, shifts the times.\n\nI also have been dealing with this problem of pandas inability to parse time series presented in local time when the time series contains a DST transition, and I have been working on a general solution, but haven't had the time to complete it (don't know much about the time series indexing internals just yet)!\n\nIn the meantime, I get around this with a simple (and quite hackish) function: Assuming some `DataFrame`, `df`, with a set, naive `DatetimeIndex` that is continuous (i.e., runs around the clock, all day, all night, 365.25 days a year) and has the same frequency (i.e., every time stamp offset is equal), then you can simple generate a time range based off of this frequency and assign it to the index.\n\n``` python\ndef parse_local_timeseries(df, tz):\n    dti = df.index.to_pydatetime()\n    dti_delta = pd.TimeSeries(dti[1:] - dti[:-1])\n    main_freq = dti_delta.value_counts().index[0]/10**9 /60\n    df.index = pd.date_range(dti[0], dti[-1], freq=str(main_freq)+'T', tz=tz)\n    return df\n```\n\nA nice little error check generates from this function in that, if your time series is missing any time stamps, this assignment of the generated date range to the `df` will fail due to difference in sizes of the `df` and generated `DatetimeIndex`.\n\nRe a better approach: I might open up a more general issue in this regard soon. So many ideas, so little time. :)\n"
