The best way to address this is by writing some tests. \n\nThe primary present limitation with type-handling in pandas compared with R is with NAs in integer columns. I just haven't got a great solution to that right now except to cast the column to float and use NaN. \n"

I might be able to contribute to that... especially now that I realize R is breaking things too!\n\nCheers,\nDav\n"

I'm hopeful with the addition of an NA type to NumPy that this can be improved in the future. \n"
