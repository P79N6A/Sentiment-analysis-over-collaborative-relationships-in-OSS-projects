    "body": "We won't be able to handle your exact case, which is calling the matplotlib plot function. As was pointed out in their issue, there's no way for them to know about our NaT. NaT is datetime like, so `float(NaT)` being `NaN` wouldn't work.\n\nWe could handle Series.plot and DataFrame.plot, with NaTs, e.g. `df.plot(x='A', y'B')` where x is a Datetime column w/ some `NaT`s, by applying the [same rules](http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/visualization.html#plotting-with-missing-data) we use for missing values (NaNs).\n"
