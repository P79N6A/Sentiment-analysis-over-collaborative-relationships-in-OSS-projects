    "body": "Interesting, I developed those tests (and the methods behind them), and they were passing previously, and certainly before I submitted the PR.\n\nRegarding the decode issue, I know there were changes to how text and data are interpreted in Python 3 (see: http://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html#text-vs-data-instead-of-unicode-vs-8-bit), but I mostly develop in Python 2.7, and was believing so much that Travis would catch things like that for me. It didn't, I guess. Thanks for the heads up and suggested fixes, I'll implement them soon to see how they affect code in 2.7. Anyone's thoughts on this would be appreciated.\n\nRegarding the failed tests to incorrect hardcoded data, I am somewhat at a loss, as I referenced specific dates and date ranges to ensure that these particular values would be absolute. These also previously passed tests and I can only think that there was either a copy-paste slip right before submitting or I am overlooking some aspect of data queries from Yahoo! Finance.\n\nEither way, your values seem correct, and I'll included them in a PR soon to see if we can squash theses errors. Still, I am going to dig a bit deeper to make sure I'm not missing something more fundamental. \n\nThanks!\n"

    "body": "Thanks @lodagro and @selasley for the feedback. \n\nIt was something fundamental:heavy_exclamation_mark:\n\nWith [Yahoo's details regarding their adjusted close calculations being quite lacking](http://help.yahoo.com/kb/index?locale=en_US&page=content&y=PROD_FIN&id=SLN2311&impressions=true), I spent a little bit more time digging around. Based off the number of threads, blog posts, and white papers I discovered, it turns out I wasn't alone, and I though it helpful to comment a bit on the topic.\n\nI was incorrect in my assumption of how yahoo calculates its adjusted close price, which I had previously assumed to be forward adjusted (i.e., based off of the starting date of the date range of interest and projected forward). As it turns out, it's a blanket _backwards_ adjusted calculation from the present, and includes adjustments for all dividends and stock splits from the present day.\n\nThe error from `test_get_data()` with the hardcoded value in the line:\n\n``` python\nexpected = [18.38, 27.45, 24.54]  #error\nexpected = [18.38, 27.45, 24.28]  #corrected value\n```\n\nrefers to `'INTC'` (Intel's) adjusted close price, the result from the query:\n\n``` python\nresult = pan.Close.ix['01-18-12'][['GE', 'MSFT', 'INTC']].tolist()\n```\n\nThe story is, the same day I submitted PR #2795 [on Feb. 5th, Intel had a dividend payout of 0.225](http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=INTC&a=02&b=13&c=1986&d=01&e=12&f=2013&g=d), which then caused **all** adjusted close prices _before_ this date to be recalculated and updated, resulting in the small change of value observed, from `24.54` to `24.28`, and resulting in everyone's develop install of pandas to be throwing these errors (apologies). For the exact same reason, the error from the query:\n\n``` python\nresult = pan.Ret_Index.ix['01-18-11':'01-21-11'][['GE', 'INTC', 'MSFT']]\n```\n\nis a result of the return index values being dependent on Intel's adjusted close price. \n\nAs such, note that references to _any_ value associated with the adjusted close price from yahoo are not absolute, and I will be updating the tests in `test_yahoo.py` to reflect this soon, with PR to follow. In the meantime, you can comment out those two specific assert statements as they aren't good test. Again, apologies about the hassle, and thanks.\n\nOh, if you'd like to learn more, checkout some helpful discussions on the topic:\n- Lots of detail on how Yahoo calculates adjusted close: \n  http://marubozu.blogspot.com/2006/09/how-yahoo-calculates-adjusted-closing.html\n- Discussion regarding quality of Yahoo data with adjusted close: \n  http://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/7216/daily-returns-using-adjusted-close \n\nEDIT: Also, I'll checkout using `decode()` in 2.7 soon, thanks.\n"
