    "body": "Yes, I don't think that is a good idea (but try to convince me otherwise!) My reasoning:\n- In a lot of (most?) applications, sub-second data will not be used, and in those cases, the `datetime` type of mysql is perfectly fine. So I think that we should, certainly by default, use the `datetime` type of mysql, as this exists.\n- I agree that in some cases (eg this loss of precision) another represention can be better, eg ints. And can also be more general (works for all types of precision). But in the case above, this would also be a lot less convenient than to store it as a `datetime`, so I wouldn't do it by default.\n- The question then is, do we provide it as an option? Or leave it to the user to do the conversion? The problem here is that multiple conversions would be possible. You could eg also argue for a string representation (better interpretable as the integer value)? You could do the conversion to ints with different timebases? So, I personally think (for now) it is better to leave this to the user to do this explicit.\n- If data would be lost due to this precision limitation, a warning would indeed be ideal. We should investigate if this is easily possible.\n"

Pandas users can convert their datetime64 columns to ints or strings before writing to the db.
