    "body": "Oh, also, I hate the [matplotlib argument names](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.hexbin) for the value (`C`) and reduction function `reduce_C_function`.\n\nA brief overview:\n\nby default (`C=None`), compute a histogram in each bin. Essentially each `(x, y)` point in a bin has a value of 1, and the reduction function is `sum` (i.e. `count` since every value is 1.)\n\nIf you specify `C` (another column of `df` for pandas), then each point is a 3 tuple `(x, y, c)`: `(x, y)` still specify what bin you end up in, and `c` determines the value passed to the reduction function `reduce_C_function`\n\nWhat's the policy on respecting other libraries' function arguments. Other pandas plotting functions seem to use `colormap` instead of matplotlib's `cmap`.\n\nIf we're willing to change, I'd suggest renaming `C` to `value` and `reduce_C_function` to `reduce` or `reduce_func`\n\nHere's an example to play with if that helps:\n\n``` python\ndf = DataFrame({\"A\": np.random.uniform(size=20),\n                \"B\": np.random.uniform(size=20),\n                \"C\": np.arange(20) + np.random.uniform(size=20)})\n\nax = df.plot(kind='hexbin', x='A', y='B', gridsize=10)  # histogram by default\nax = df.plot(kind='hexbin', x='A', y='B', C='C', reduce_C_function=np.max)\n```\n\nSo in the second case the color of a bin will be determined by the maximum value of `C` (from column `C` in `df`) in that bin.\n"

    "body": "While cubehelix solves the saturation problem, it doesn't solve the issue that the [rainbow colormap is harmful](http://www.jwave.vt.edu/~rkriz/Projects/create_color_table/color_07.pdf) and does not help with interpretation of the heatmap. The linked paper gives great examples how the changing colors introduce patterns in the data that don't actually exist and can lead to over-interpretation of color changes.\n\nI don't think using different colormaps for different data ranges is that complicated, in `prettyplotlib` it's a simple check of the data's `max` and `min` and using a divergent heatmap like blue-red if there's negative _and_ positive values, or a sequential heatmap if there's only positive _or_ negative values. These colormaps are built into `matplotlib`\n\nI'm still working on my `matplotlib` install. I have some code for a clustered heatmap as well (like `heatmap.2` in R)  that would use but it depends on `scipy`, so I'm guessing I'd have to implement hierarchical clustering myself to reduce `pandas`'s dependencies. Plus as a data science/bioinformatics purist I'd want it to have [optimal leaf ordering](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/suppl_1/S22.long), too. This is the [default in MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/optimalleaforder.html), but not in R or `scipy`.\n\nAs for renaming, I agree that the `matplotlib` arguments are cryptic but I personally prefer consistency over introducing new standards: http://xkcd.com/927/\n"

    "body": "I set the matplotlib default colormap to cubehelix in seaborn because I wanted to banish jet and that seemed like a reasonably non-crappy alternative that is at least somewhat adaquate for most data. I don't think the hue shifts are as big a problem in cubehelix as in rainbow maps and jet because they're pretty gradual and accompanied by a shift in lightness/saturation.\n\nBut in general I agree that there's no good one-size-fits-all solution to colormaps, and it's better to adapt to the data. For the [corrplot function](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/linear_models.html#plotting-correlation-heatmaps) the default colormap is `coolwarm`, which I tend to prefer a bit to `RdBu` as the extreme values aren't quite as dark.\n"

I'm going with `BuGr` as the default since the default aggregation is by counts, which will always be nonnegative. If you're using a different aggregation then you should choose the appropriate colormap.\n\nOne thing I'm a tad concerned about is the docstring on df.plot.  I thew in a `Notes` with things specific to `hexbin`. I wonder if we should put explanations in a separate function like `scipy.integrate.quad_explain()` does. Or I could remove that and just point people to the html docs.\n\nLet me know when your ready and I'll rebase and squash.\n"
