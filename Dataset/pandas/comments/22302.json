    "body": "I actually think it would be great to have .head() and similar work. I am a styler newbie, but have a function that returns a formatted Dataframe styler. Would love to be able to work with it in the same way I work with a DataFrame in general, but have the styles be retained each time I refer to the DataFrame(e.g. set styles once , then call .loc for different slices one at a time instead of having to set the style each time I slice it) \r\n\r\nAny chance you could reopen this? Thanks!"
