    "body": "Hi @vincenzooo ,\n\nMost of the devs don't use windows so it can be difficult to chase down issues like this.\nHowever, the windows binaries get used by quite a few users and so far this is the only report\nwe've gotten.\nWith 0.11.0 due in a few days, it's important that we know if this is a regression introduced in \n0.11.0 for all users, or something particular to your system.\nWith that in mind,  Is there _any_ version of the binaries that  you've been able to get working on your system?\n"
