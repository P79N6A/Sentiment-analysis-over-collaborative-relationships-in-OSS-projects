    "body": "@chennipman, I think your beef is with `min_periods`, which defaults to `window`. (Personally I would have had it default to `0`, but the existing behavior long predates me.) Does specifying `min_periods=0` lead to what you want?\n\nNote that a the value produced for a window will be `NaN` unless the window has at least `min_periods` non-missing/`NaN` values -- and that it doesn't distinguish between the case where such deficiency is due to the window being too small (i.e. it's still \"expanding\", for the first `window-1` entries) and the case where such deficiency is due to the window containing too many missing/`NaN` values (and of course there's an overlap, where there are missing/`NaN` values in the first `window-1` entries). I guess an alternative to `min_periods` would be a `max_missing` parameter, which would specify that a non-`NaN` value should be produced so long as no more than `max_missing` entries in the window are missing/`NaN`.\n"
