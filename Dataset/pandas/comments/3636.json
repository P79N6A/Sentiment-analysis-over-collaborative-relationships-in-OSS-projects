    "body": "Hello @jreback \n\nYes : #3644 is exactly #3628 after reading the CONTRIBUTING and git documentation.\n\nCONTRIBUTING is speaking of \"rebase\", but in my newcomer case I found  \"git reset\" to be more fit. \n\nMaybe would it be helpfull for your next newcomer to include a few more lines/links on \"how to transform a working_patch in a working_PR\" ? \n\nMaybe there is a nice résumé-on-a-page somewhere already, but it's hard to find it as a newcomer.\n\n # the procedure I figured out for my particular case  \n.....0 - remember next time it's better to not touch your MASTER branch of the forked project, work only on branches \n.... 1 - connect TRAVIS CI to your github account\n.... 2 - commit a patch on your \"my_working_patch\" branch to test Travis, until it works\n\nthen, to rewrite history of your \"my_working_patch\" patch from current pandas master commit\n.... 3 - read CONTRIBUTING and previous commits on pydata/pandas to understand what it means.\n.... 4 - do the following until success (expect 3 hepic fails, so keep untouched your \"my_working_patch\")  \ngit remote add pandas_upstream \"https://github.com/pydata/pandas.git\"\ngit fetch pandas_upstream\ngit checkout \"my_working_patch\"\ngit branch \"my_working_PR\"\ngit merge pandas_upstream/master \n   (resolve manually non-automatic merge issues  ... (purchase a book on \"git\" here, or iron your shirts while looking at youtube tutorials) ...)\n... check you are on your \"my_working_PR\" before doing the next \"git reset\" command, and all will be fine and safe\ngit reset  83a6e0...51f18cea (the sha of the last commit you see on the official pydata/pandas MASTER branch)\n   ... then , file by file, include the test creation part \ngit diff (show you the files to contributes, so you know the \"git add\" to do)\ngit add pandas/io/tests/test_sql.py  (for example)\ngit commit  -m \"TST: blabla test issue xxx\"\ngit branch \"my_working_PR_test_only\" \n  ... that branch will be automatically tested by Travis, and should fail to demonstrate the issue\n  ... then, file by file, include the bug solving part\ngit diff (show you the remaining files to contributes, so you know the \"git add\" to do next)\ngit add pandas/io/sql.py  (for example again)\ngit commit  -m \"BUG : blabla solve issue xxx\"\n\n... 5 - do your PR  when \nthe Travis \"my_working_PR_test_only\"  is red \nthe Travis \"my_working_PR\" is green\nlooking at your commits, you don't feel totally ashame in regards to CONTRIBUTING.\ncheck you are on the \"my_working_PR\" branch when you click the upper right \"Pull Request\" button\n"
