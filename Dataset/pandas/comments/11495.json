    "body": "you are using a quite odd combination here. latest numpy (1.10), with quite old bottleneck (0.8.0). You would not normally do this (its hard to actually install this as you would have to install via source for everything).\n\nAnd these have incompat `np.nansum([np.nan])` behavior. So pandas tests against the old behavior actually (which IMHO makes much more sense). Though allow the new behavior. Since you have an odd combination we are not supporting this in tests.\n"

    "body": "As for \"you would have to install via source for everything\", the current FreeBSD ports tree publishes [numpy 1.10.0](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/math/py-numpy/Makefile?revision=400679) and [bottleneck 0.8.0](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/ports/head/math/py-bottleneck/Makefile?revision=400679), so users who install from the official repository of precompiled binary packages would get those versions, which is why I tested with that combination. I will work with the maintainer of the bottleneck port to update to a more modern version.\n"
