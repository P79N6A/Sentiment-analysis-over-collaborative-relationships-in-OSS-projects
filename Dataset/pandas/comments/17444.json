    "body": "I'm looking into it, and it seems that the bug is due to its `CategoricalBlock` step having `ndim` evaluating to `2`, whereas its `values.ndim` evaluate to `1`. I think it has to do with how a `Block` object has an ndim of `2` by default.\r\nMaybe we aren't sending the ndim parameter and we should, or is this supposed to be correct?"
