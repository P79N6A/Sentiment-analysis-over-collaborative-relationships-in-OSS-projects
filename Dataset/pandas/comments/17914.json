    "body": "The issue with caching DateOffset objects is that they are mutable.  Most users will never tinker with them, but for the few who do, this could cause a lot of headaches.  The medium-long term solution is to make DateOffsets immutable, then cache all of them.  (Related: immutability will let us improve `__hash__` 5-10x  and `__eq__/__ne__` by ~50x.)\r\n\r\nThere are a few more steps before we can implement immutability, but we recently got past a big roadblock with #17458.  The current plan is to move the guts of `tseries.offsets` to `_libs.tslibs.offsets` and declare the relevant attributes `cdef readonly`.  The attendant yak-shaving is moving forward with #17830, #17827, and #17746.\r\n\r\nBTW there's also a `CacheableOffset` that AFAICT is unused.\r\n\r\nI suppose in the interim enabling `_cacheable` for users who know what they're doing (or possibly making it the default and requiring users who want to tinker to change it?) is a viable option.  Is that what you had in mind?"
