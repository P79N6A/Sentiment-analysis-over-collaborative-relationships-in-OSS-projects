    "body": "Sigh...I thought it was simple.  Then I thought about it again (and saw tests fail), and I see now that it is another manifestation of the major discrepancy between the Python and the C engines.\n\nI thought the Python engine was bugged, but now I realise that it isn't.  The reason the logic is written that way is because we want to fully control which values are `NaN` when we pass in `na_values`, which is why we pass in `convert_empty=False`.\n\nSo why the C engine does not convert to `NaN` is because of this issue with converters <a href=\"https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/parser.pyx#L1035\">here</a>.  Notice that no `NaN` processing is done if you have a converter.\n\nArguably, this is a dupe of my issue <a href=\"https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/13302\">here</a>.  @jreback, you can be the judge whether this one here can be closed in light of this other issue.\n"
