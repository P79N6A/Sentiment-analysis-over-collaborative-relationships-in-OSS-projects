    "body": "The direct answer to your question is here https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/11603#discussion_r47631460 - as you may or may not be aware, there used to be set a of top level `pd.rolling_*` functions that were refactored into the current OO interface.  `pd.rolling_window` got stuffed into `.rolling`, not really out of design, but just as a place to put it.\r\n\r\nAs you note, it's sort of half-implemented - only supports sum and mean.  I wouldn't be opposed to having it more fully implemented under a `.window` accessor with `.apply`, etc, but not sure how much it actually gets used (never something I've used myself)."

    "body": "Thanks, acknowledged. `.apply()` would be used e.g. for signal processing where different window forms are required and where people want to avoid transforming pandas data into the underlying scipy APIs just for doing that. \r\nBtw: `core.window.rolling()` distinguishing `win_type=None` and `win_type='boxcar'` and returning different object types based on this seems to be caused by same underlying inconsistency. Both have the same semantic meaning and AFAIK do the same thing in the background (see https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/17893#issuecomment-336911202)."
