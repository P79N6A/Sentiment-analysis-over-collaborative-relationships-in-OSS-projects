E.g. say you have 1-min data and want daily rolling stats. Then in order to do this we would have:\n\n`s.resample('D',how='max').rolling(window=3).max()`\n\nrather than (not that the `how` is currently defaulted, but shown for clarity\n`s.rolling(window=3).max(freq='D',how='max')`\nor\n`s.rolling(window=3,freq='D').max(how='max')`\n\nFurther now that I look at it, the window above is a function of the data (by definition), and IIRC, this is a source of confusion.

In particular, it starts to make a distinction between `1H` and `60Min` which resample does not -- the magnitude and unit for the frequency are now independently meaningful.

    "body": "The algorithm is a median smoothing that requires repeated iteration until\nstopping condition i reached (mapd of the smoothed n with smoothed n-1)\n\nIn addition between each pass the smoothed series is compared to the\noriginal data to identify any outliers.  There are also specific rules\nabout how to interpolate / fill across Nans.. This basically rules out\nbottleneck which does not allow nans in the series.\n\nThe fact that each series is different, has different masked days and will\nstop after a varying number of passes makes it difficult to  run at a more\naggregate level than the single time series.\n\nIn the optimized code running this for 45000 series  each of length 160\ntakes 7 min It starts with  a single series and multiindex and in two\nnested groupbys runs the smoothing algorithm on a single series and then\nreturns a single dataframe of the same shape and index as the original.\n\nOf the 7 min, that smooth_a_series inner loop takes 4 min of which the\nrolling moment time is  70 seconds.\n\nIf I go back to using series , and masking values in the series , saving\nthe results to series and then looking for outlier values in the series and\na mapd calculation across the two series  this adds another 2-3 min to the\nrun time;  or since this is 0.25 % of the total or about  15hrs cumulative\nrun time.  By staying in ndarrays and saving values in place I displace\ngazillion object creations.\n\nBut let me say the skiplist moving median algorithm for moving median is\nwhy we are using pandas for this project.There is a reason why Oracle does\nnot have a moving median   algorithm either inits database or,last time I\nchecked, in its native functions in Oracle Enterprise R. naive sorting\nalgorthms really don't scale for this .\n\nOn Tue, Dec 1, 2015 at 5:58 PM, Stephan Hoyer notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> @jonblunt https://github.com/jonblunt if you're using pure numpy\n> arrays, you might just want to use bottleneck\n> https://github.com/kwgoodman/bottleneck's move_median instead.\n> \n> 窶能n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/11603#issuecomment-161136118.\n"
