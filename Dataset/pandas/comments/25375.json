    "body": "Thanks for the report - very strange indeed. I think the divergence starts occurring around this line:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/b2c751985ebd09b72d917d08dc06193dc0922018/pandas/core/frame.py#L7423\r\n\r\nThe first frame successfully gets something back from `op.get_result()` whereas the latter runs into a KeyError there, which is caught and subsequently sent somewhere else for processing. I don't *think* that divergence should be happening at that point in the code.\r\n\r\nFurther investigation and PRs would certainly be welcome"
