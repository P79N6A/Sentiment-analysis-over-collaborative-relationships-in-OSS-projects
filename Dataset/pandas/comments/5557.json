    "body": "was failing on the repr of a Series when it had a non-monotonic Float64Index, as was selecting using `s[:15]` and not `s.iloc[:15]`.....thanks for the catch!\n\nIts actually a bit insidious because the Index is ultimately converted to Int64Index but at an intermediate stage is a Float64Index (where it fails not on the repr, but on the sorting, but its the same error)\n"

    "body": "Ah, the repr-- I should have realized that from the traceback.  This explains why it seemed as random as it did.  Some of my manual reductions to a smaller case (originally the frame was 130k rows long) worked, but my automated find-a-minimal example routine didn't work at all.  I'd attributed that to something sensitive to memory, but in fact it was that my find-a-minimal-example routine didn't ever use the repr..\n\nThanks for the quick turnaround; this was actually a blocker on some paid work I was doing!\n"
