We're trying more and more to take advantage of DataFrames as containers to display information, to_latex, to_csv, etc. and this is just noise here. It is descriptive information, which is why I think it should be in `info` just not in the `__repr__`.

    "body": "Yes, I'm not saying it affects anything else. I'm saying that we like those features, but we also like a clean `__repr__`. In the case when we're using it as a table-like container, e.g., in ANOVA tables above, the clean `__repr__` trumps everything for me. Trying quickly to scan a bunch of ANOVA tables, I'm interrupted with this noise about the rows and columns and it makes interactive use more difficult to the point where I'd rather fall back on our old, horrible to use summary tables. IIRC, we also have a PR to move our summary tables  partially into DataFrames, which will also be affected.\n\nIt used to be that by default when the frame was truncated, that you got the `info()` view, which I preferred, but can live without. Why not show this new information only if the DataFrame is, in fact, truncated?\n\nBut, again, as you pointed out, you always have `info`, so you can just call it. And `shapes` is also just one tab-completion away. It just seems that there are so many other ways to get this information than forcing it into the default `__repr__` of everything.\n\nI hate to nit-pick here, but this is a pretty jarring visual change from what I'm used to, and there's not much gained.\n"

I think scipy.sparse matrices do, but are we really saying that a DataFrame that's truncated on output is like a sparse matrix? Originally, DFs showed the `info` view. But sometimes you want to peak at the data. So it grew a `head` and `tail` like data.frames. There's also `shape`. Is anyone really printing out the full `__repr__` of a DataFrame just to find out about the rows and columns? This just seems like an addition for the sake of having an addition to me.

    "body": "Ok, then here's another gripe. Discussions on github are not public enough IMO. There is a lot of a github noise from pandas. I try my best to keep up with development, but I don't see this until I install it. It seems to me, you're saying \"I participated in the discussion, and it went on for a long time, so that's that.\"\n\nThis was discussed by 3 people on #4886 and #5550. @y-p made some strenuous initial objections (which are in line with my initial reaction) and then withdrew them. Particularly this bit\n\n```\nI strongly urge conducting a small usability study (have a few users adopt it for a week \nand report) before making potentially disruptive change like this to UX.\n```\n\nThere are several other sensible comments to this effect.\n\nIt would've been great to see a ping on the mailing list about this. Something. Anything. Maybe I missed it and it's my fault. But, hey, let's think of this release as the usability study.\n\nComing back to the point, the issue of the footer was discussed only in passing on #5550. And here's what it says (my emphasis).\n\n```\n**When truncating**, having a footer with total row count would eliminate the need \nto use df.info in many cases and so reduce the impact of the change on existing users. \n(For example, after filtering a frame you're often interested in the size of the result).\n```\n"

Since I missed the discussion and the changes had already been made I didn't bother piping up.\n"
