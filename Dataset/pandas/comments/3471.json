I unfortunately lost the pip.log, though I can probably reproduce it if needed.\n\n> I would guess you compiled numpy from git master, without resetting to the 1.7 maintenance branch.\n> try \"git reset --hard v1.7.1\" , reinstall numpy, and pandas and hopefully the issue will be resolved.\n\nThis fixed the problem.
