    "body": "@fabboe yeh all of these should not be allowed. However, the detection code is a bit tricky. As it will try to figure out if `df.ix[x,y]` actually means `df.ix[(x,y)]` (in the general case). IOW, if someone really means a tuple and just didn't pass it way (its a bit TOO flexible IMHO), but this is a bit tricky to change.\n\nThese would need some tests in `tests/test_indexing.py`\n"
