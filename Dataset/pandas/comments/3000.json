If you provide a self-contained test-case I'll try to get a fix in for\nthe upcoming 0.11.0 release.\n\n**correction**: _should_ derive from Mapping,  but it looks like the module goes all the \nway beck to old-style classes, so I guess that won't happen.\nThere's a pending PR, and you'll just need to register the `Message` class with the \n`Mapping` ABC, see test case.\n"
