    "body": "TL;DR.\n\nSo lots of 'boilerplate' changes in `generated.pyx`, which is basically all of the algorithms for groupby ops themselves (e.g. sum,mean). These were straightforward insertions of `with nogil`, just needed to avoid typing the `object` ones (which for the most part was easy; though a bit tricky on some non-groupby routines, e.g. see #10213).\n\nHowever, the big speeds occur once I fixed the `hashtable.pyx` factorizer (e.g. the `get_labels` routine). The trivial soln actually produces a very odd perf issue (see [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/cython-users/jtZ0FOGX2vU)), which is a bug / documentation issue.\n\nIn effect, you are using a `nogil` function that happens to have a `with gil` block WITHIN it, then the function is way slower than if you inline the exact same code.\n\nI 'fixed' this issue by adding some additional c-structures to hold data (basically I changed the low-level implementation); these can be easily passed around; downside is that are a little 'messy' in the code department.\n\nnote to @shoyer I didn't actually bypass the realloc of memory (e.g. `.resize`) of numpy arrays. though I do have a soln to that (basically manage a memory block myself, then turning that into a numpy array at the very end (in `to_array`), easy enough, but was running into some compile issues, so dropped it in the end).\n"
