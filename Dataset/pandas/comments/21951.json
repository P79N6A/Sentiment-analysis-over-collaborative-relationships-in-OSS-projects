(assuming that with `join_axes` it reindexes each input before concatenating)\r\n\r\nIt is certainly true the way it is explained and spelled (eg the fact that you need to pass a list) is certainly outdated now Panel is removed. But we could also consider improving it. \r\n\r\nYou can eg now use it to basically do a 'left' join.\r\n\r\n(note that I am not married to the keyword, I have never used it myself, but just think we should have a bit more discussion about it. It would be interesting to search for usage on github/SO)\r\n\r\n"
