Installing via statsmodels/statsmodels (vers `'0.5.0.dev-1bbd4ca'`) as suggested resolved everything and I'm now passing all tests. \n\nI'm not sure if this strange pip installation would have a major impact on users (besides failing this OLS test), but wanted to point out that the problem was still there. \n\nThank you!\n\n```\n======================================================================\nFAIL: testWLS (pandas.stats.tests.test_ols.TestOLS)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/stats/tests/test_ols.py\", line 107, in testWLS\n    self._check_wls(X, Y, weights)\n  File \"/stats/tests/test_ols.py\", line 130, in _check_wls\n    self.checkMovingOLS('rolling', x, y, weights=weights)\n  File \"/stats/tests/test_ols.py\", line 204, in checkMovingOLS\n    result_index=n)\n  File \"/stats/tests/test_ols.py\", line 243, in compare\n    assert_almost_equal(ref, res)\n  File \"/util/testing.py\", line 106, in assert_almost_equal\n    assert_almost_equal(a[i], b[i])\n  File \"/util/testing.py\", line 124, in assert_almost_equal\n    1, a / b, decimal=5, err_msg=err_msg(a, b), verbose=False)\n  File \"python2.7/site-packages/numpy/testing/utils.py\", line 468, in assert_almost_equal\n    raise AssertionError(msg)\nAssertionError: \nArrays are not almost equal to 5 decimals expected 0.50510 but got 0.51438\n```\n"
