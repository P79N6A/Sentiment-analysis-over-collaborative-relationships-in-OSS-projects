    "body": "I need to sort out a strategy similar to statsmodels to include example data sets with pandas. Care to help out? I didn't want to check in baseball.csv as is because it's over a megabyte, but I'll likely include a little chunk of it for docs and doing some groupby examples. To get the docs to build in the meantime, fire up R in the pandas/doc directory and do:\n\n```\ninstall.packages(\"plyr\")\nlibrary(plyr)\ndata(baseball)\nwrite.csv(baseball, \"baseball.csv\")\n```\n"
