    "body": "I believe @adailsonfilho means that there are colspan attributes on columns labeled \"Cities\" and \"Area in mi2 (km2)[B][16]\" in the first header row. The solution would be that for any cell with a colspan value of n, the cell text is repeated across the next n-1 preceding rows. This issue applies to any td or th tag regardless of whether it is located in thead or tbody (see the cell with text \"Phoenix\" in the third row of the table referenced above.)"
