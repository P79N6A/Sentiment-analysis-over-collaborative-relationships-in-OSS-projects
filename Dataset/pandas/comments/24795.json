    "body": "@noamher : Thanks for opening this PR!  While the performance increases sounds appealing from the onset, a couple of points that could improve this proposal:\r\n\r\n* Given the degree of personal uncertainty in your own implementation, we generally prefer that you open an issue **PRIOR TO** the PR.  The issue is a better place to iron out those uncertainties before making a concrete proposal to change the code.\r\n\r\n* You should run the ASV benchmarks (under the `asv_bench` directory) to provide more concrete evidence that this is indeed a performance speedup.  If the tests don't indicate any performance speedup, trying adding your new benchmark to provide that evidence."
