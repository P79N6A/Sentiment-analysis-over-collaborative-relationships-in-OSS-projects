I'd merge on green but will wait until 0.13.1 is released, out of caution.\nPlease have a look at guidelines on commit subjects in [https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). If you're comfortable with git,\nyou may amend, if not leave them as is and we'll take care of it.\n\nIf you wish to do more, I suggest you open a seperate PR with more work. \nKeeping PRs small makes it easier for us to review and merge with confidence.\n\nThanks for contributing.\n"
