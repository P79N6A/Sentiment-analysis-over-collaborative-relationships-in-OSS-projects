    "body": "> Bracket notation is typically reserved for selection by column label.\r\n\r\nHmm, in my hands it doesn't appear to function this way? This is what I'm doing:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nnmat = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9],[10,11,12]])\r\npmat = pd.DataFrame(nmat, index=[3,1,0,2])\r\nprint(pmat)\r\n#     0   1   2\r\n# 3   1   2   3\r\n# 1   4   5   6\r\n# 0   7   8   9\r\n# 2  10  11  12\r\n\r\npmat[0:2]\r\n#    0  1  2\r\n# 3  1  2  3\r\n# 1  4  5  6\r\n\r\npmat.loc[0:2]\r\n#     0   1   2\r\n# 0   7   8   9\r\n# 2  10  11  12\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe you just mean as a convention from a style point of view and not functionally? Or Perhaps I'm missing something? Let me know what you think.\r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\nOkay, there is also columns, which do behave in a label-based way when using bracket notation, which is limited to using lists as the indexing method, compared to rows, which also have the range notation (i.e., `begin:end`)\r\nWith that in mind, the ambiguity problem you bring up seems to already be in play, since rows behave as true indices but columns behave as labels. Allowing them both to happen within one query instead of two seems fine.\r\n\r\nIt also seems that columns should gain the ability to use the range notation too. Ultimately I think a good implementation would be to just map the bracket notation call straight to the `iloc()` function when it's detected that rows and columns are being simultaneously indexed. "
