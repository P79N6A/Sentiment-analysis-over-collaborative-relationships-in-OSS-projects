    "body": "I have encountered a similar hang, when doing `import pandas as pd` at the top level of a Python file which I import using `boost::python::exec()`.  I'm using Pandas 0.19.2 and Python 3.5.  It hangs when it imports indexing.py which does this:\r\n\r\n    _eps = np.finfo('f4').eps\r\n\r\nAnd indeed, if I just import numpy and do that myself instead of importing Pandas, it hangs as well, seemingly trying to manage the GIL.\r\n\r\n@Ty-WDFW if you have a chance, perhaps you can try replacing the above-mentioned line in indexing.py with this approximation:\r\n\r\n    _eps = 1.1920929e-07\r\n\r\nAnd see if that fixes the hang.  Or just try doing `np.finfo('f4').eps` in your own script before you import pandas and see if it hangs there.\r\n\r\nIn my case, the problem seems to be that `Py_Initialize()` was called in one thread during startup, then the actual Python code was executed in a different thread later.  The GIL ends up being held by the first thread and `np.finfo()` tries to acquire it in the second.  One solution to this is to call `PyEval_InitThreads(); PyEval_SaveThread();` after `Py_Initialize()`, then acquire the GIL explicitly before each call into the Python C API."

    "body": "@jorisvandenbossche No, it is not a NumPy bug, though it is pretty strange/annoying that `np.finfo()` does anything with the GIL.\r\n\r\nThe only true bug that I believe exists here is in the outer application, which in my case and probably in all the cases here called `Py_Initialize()` in one thread, then ran Python code in another thread without the Python C API mandated calls to `PyEval_InitThreads()` and so on.  In other words, this is a classic deadlock caused by lock precondition violation.\r\n\r\nIf Pandas wants to make life easier on future folks who could get screwed up by this, it is probably possible to check if the GIL is held by the thread which imports pandas, by importing a small Cython module at the top of pandas.py with code as here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11366556/how-can-i-check-whether-a-thread-currently-holds-the-gil\r\n\r\nIt could really save some people a lot of time (as evidenced by this issue; it took me perhaps two hours to debug my own occurrence of the same).  And it isn't a lot of code...just needs a careful hand to get it right, and a willingness to add a bit more Cython, which I have previously been told is not desirable in Pandas generally.\r\n\r\nThen again, this diagnostic could equally be applied to Python's very own `import` mechanism (because importing anything while the GIL is not held is an error, and importing anything is already not high-performance).  Or to the various `PyRun_*()` functions, all of which run Python code so must never be called from C when the GIL is not held."

    "body": "@jreback and @jorisvandenbossche: I just noticed that the NumPy docs explicitly say that `finfo()` should not be cached at the module level (when developing NumPy itself).  I admit that `import pandas` is already far slower than `import numpy`, but if Pandas wishes to follow NumPy's edict, it might be a good idea to move Pandas' `finfo()` call into the one function which needs it, `is_index_slice()`."
