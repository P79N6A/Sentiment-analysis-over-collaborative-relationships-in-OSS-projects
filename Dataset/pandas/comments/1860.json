    "body": "NDFrame is almost there - a couple of tweaks to avoid explict names in dimensionality drops is all that really required (e.g. just like you have _constructor, you need a _sub_constructor) - though this might have a performance impact (which you could avoid by hard coding in Panel/FDPanel).\n\nYou might have a use case where you take a multi-index dataframe and expand the dimensions to make a NDFrame\nI do this explicity and just represent many things as panel, as I prefer the syntax and usage of panels versus multi-index\n"
