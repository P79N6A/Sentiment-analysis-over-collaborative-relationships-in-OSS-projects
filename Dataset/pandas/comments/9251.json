    "body": "Having thought about this further, I realised that passing repeated indices is actually reasonable and useful in some situations, i.e. when you want to return a view or copy with repeated rows, e.g.\n\n```\ndf = pd.DataFrame(np.arange(6).reshape(3, 2), columns = ['A', 'B'])\ndf.loc[[1, 2, 1, 2, 3], 'A']\n1     2\n2     4\n1     2\n2     4\n3   NaN\n```\n\nAssigning works as long as all indices are present:\n\n```\ndf.loc[[1, 2, 1, 2], 'A'] = 5\ndf['A']\n0    0\n1    5\n2    5\n```\n\nHowever, as the example in the original post demonstrates, when you pass repeated indices to a mulitindex you don't get repeated rows or blocks of rows and you can't assign values in that way.\n"
