I was hoping to pose this as an intermediate step, seeing as we can\nsurely only support a subset of CSS, ideally corresponding to what is\ncurrently generated through Styler's declarative API. (There are many ways\nto specify border styles, colours, etc in CSS.) I am not sure of the time\nframe in which I can make a solid attempt at that. I see that providing a\ndefault converter has the advantage of not exposing the internal excel\nstyling language to users.\n\nYes, @jreback there seem to be problems with rendering.

    "body": "Thanks @jreback for the feedback on API.\r\n\r\n@chris-b1:\r\n\r\n> though I would probably make the handlers return a dict of style rather than mutating.\r\n\r\nI considered this. I mutate in order to take advantage of `setdefault`. This allows setting the `patternType` to `'solid'` only if it was not set to something else. On the other hand, this may be construed as `ExcelWriter` having a bug in that it doesn't default to `patternType='solid'`. I would rather not have to modify `ExcelWriter` every time something like this is needed, so mutating is best, IMO.\r\n\r\n> And to be clear, I personally would be fine initially supporting a tiny subset of CSS (even just font color and backround). Could take the dependency if needed, although I'm not sure how much it would really add in this case?\r\n\r\nI'm not yet certain about the need for a CSS parser, but as is the way of these things, you can implement something that works for the limited cases you've thought of, but then someone will break it, even just by specifying \"red\" or \"hsl(0, 100%, 50%)\" or \"rgb(255, 0, 0)\" or \"rgba(255, 0, 0, 100)\" instead of \"#ff0000\", let alone by inserting a comment or unexpected use of whitespace, etc.\r\n\r\n> I personally would be fine initially supporting a tiny subset of CSS (even just font color and backround)\r\n\r\nFont and background colour seem a good place to start, followed by borders. Ideally we'd support the bar charting provided by `Styler`, but will have to [wait on `openpyxl` for that](https://bitbucket.org/openpyxl/openpyxl/issues/771)."

    "body": "I've attempted to implement a few handlers. Tricky parsing cases include `font` which can be composed of identifiers, strings for font name (comma separated for a back-off strategy which won't be handled in Excel except to set font family) and numeric quantities (for size). Functions may also be present, at least in theory, and while we would ignore them, splitting on whitespace becomes insufficent. The many expressions of `font` would still need handling with `tinycss`, but at least it would identify the token types and handle string escaping.\r\n\r\nTricky not in terms of parsing but in terms of conversion are elements that require state to be stored that is not naturally represented in the Excel style dicts. One (not very useful) example is that `text-decoration-style` may indicate `single`, `double` etc, but it applies to `underline`, `overline` (not supported in Excel) or `line-through` (double not supported in openpyxl) depending on `text-decoration-line`. So we can provide limited support, or need to maintain state that is not part of the output."

    "body": "In terms of `to_excel`, my preferred design is to create `ExcelFormatter.write(writer_or_path)`. Since almost all of the `to_excel` parameters are for the `ExcelFormatter` constructor this reduces error in documentation and passing variables. It also mimics the `save` on `CSVFormatter` and the `to_*` called by DataFrame on `DataFrameFormatter`. Let me know if you strongly prefer a function in `pandas.io.excel` doing the `ExcelFormatter` construction.\r\n\r\nI note that `to_excel`'s `encoding` parameter goes nowhere. Should it be deprecated? In another PR (ideally by someone else!)?"
