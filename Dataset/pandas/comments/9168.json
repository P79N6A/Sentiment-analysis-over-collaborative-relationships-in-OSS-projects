In my case, I can't make assumptions about the timestamps (the timestamps may not even come at regular time intervals). They are timestamps arriving asynchronously at the `ms` scale, and they trigger specific events that we are trying to cross-reference with high precision.  Let me know if any of this is still unclear. Thanks.\n"
