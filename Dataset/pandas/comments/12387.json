    "body": "Thanks for the explanation.  I still have to ask why the different behavior for the two values of `orient`?  For `orient=index` passing scalars is fine.  For `orient=columns` suddenly scalars are forbidden.   I suspect you are so familiar with this code that that this behavior doesn't surprise you, but it certainly surprises me.  I would have a difficult time rationalizing this seemingly arbitrary distinction.\n\nBTW, perhaps it is time to revisit #4916 and deprecate `.from_dict` as its functionality is duplicated in the basic constructor?\n"
