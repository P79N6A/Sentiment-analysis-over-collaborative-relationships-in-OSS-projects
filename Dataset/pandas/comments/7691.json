    "body": "@jorisvandenbossche Thanks for looking at this PR. \n\n1) Overflow issue: I should be subtracting absolute values from the width/height instead of a percentage value. The row count at the bottom, for example, takes the same number of rows independent of the w/h. I fixed it for rows and it works when I resize the terminal on Ubuntu. For columns, there is indeed a problem. I have to investigate this further. \n\n2) Speed issue: I tested this with (100,100) frames and the speed is ok. This indeed gets very slow for very large dfs. The reason is that I generate the string for the whole frame. Then I know the size of the elements and can cut as many columns as needed to fit to the desired width. I went this route because it was fast to implement. \nAlternatively one could add columns left and right until the screen is filled. This way one only has to format columns that are ultimately printed. \n"
