    "body": "@simon-b Thanks for the catch!\r\n\r\nOnce this was correct, see eg the old docs of pandas 0.8 with this example: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.8.0/gotchas.html#reindex-versus-ix-gotchas, but apparently that behaviour was changed (the docs of 0.9.0 already show the current behaviour) but the docs never updated.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would expect `ix` to fallback to integer indexing in this case (certainly given the explanation in the docs on ix http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#different-choices-for-indexing, which is actually also wrong). But the complexity and unpredictability of `.ix` is one of the reasons we are going to deprecate it (see https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/14218). \r\nGiven that, we should probably just remove this whole section.\r\n"
