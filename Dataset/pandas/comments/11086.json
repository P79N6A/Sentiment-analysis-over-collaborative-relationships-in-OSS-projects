    "body": "so the case is an index that has `idx.freq is None` with another will NOT take the fast path, but then both compare equal. ok so far.\n\nThen an infererence happens [here](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/tseries/index.py#L899)\n\nI suppose if both have incoming `freq is None` then don't need to infer.\n\nNot sure what this would break though.\n\nwant to do a PR and see?\n"
