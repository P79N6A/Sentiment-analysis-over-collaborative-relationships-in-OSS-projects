Mainly because you have to test it (for categorical its trivial but for dt its not because you sometimes have to convert it which can take a small but non-zero amount of time). and I don't think it distracts that much anyhow (their are lots of methods).\n"

I am OK with these not being guaranteed by the API docs, but they do need to be public for ndarray compatibility.\n\nI have also made a bit of progress on N-dimensional categorical (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/8012) but don't let that stop you from merging this PR first.\n"

If their code\nwill silently do something bad (e.g. return the wrong results), then use\nFutureWarning.\n\nOf course pandas can use whatever rule it prefers, but that's one approach.\n\nOn Thu, Aug 14, 2014 at 2:16 PM, Joris Van den Bossche <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Don't we use FutureWarnings for deprecation?
