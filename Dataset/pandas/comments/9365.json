    "body": "I think a limited method might be in-scope for pandas (esp if we are using it for something else). How to prevent this from _growing_ into a full-fledged (which needs support) for arbitrary distance functions (e.g. would this be different from `scikit-learn` impl?). Should we in effect use their impl for arbitrary things (e.g. import at run-time like we do `scipy`?) and only have an impl that is needed internally instead?\n"

    "body": "I agree, we definitely don't want to reimplement KDTrees in pandas. We should use scipy or scikit-learn as run-time dependencies for this feature -- both of them have suitable KDTree implementations. The [scikit-learn version](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KDTree.html) is slightly more flexible, though, with support for more distance metrics. See [here](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/04/29/benchmarking-nearest-neighbor-searches-in-python/) and [here](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/4236#issuecomment-68635858) for more background.\n"
