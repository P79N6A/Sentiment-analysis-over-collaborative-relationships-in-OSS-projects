If you want to interact with some other data, it will need to be properly marshalled / wrapped to a pandas data type and object in `libpandas`. So comparison will happen after mapping NumPy dtypes to pandas types (which is already implicitly happening, but because of the fragmentation between NumPy and non-NumPy types it's a bit messy).\n\n> how 'separable' is this dtype meant to be? e.g. in theory this should be a separate library that say\n> numpy/python could actually build upon (or maybe just is just a working impl that someone else \n> can build on).\n\nAt least at the outset not very separable (making it so would be a lot of work with little benefit), but with some engineering effort the code could be made reusable. \n"
