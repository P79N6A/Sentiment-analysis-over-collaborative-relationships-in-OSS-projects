I've\nadded a name property in core.series.py as Stephan suggested. I've also\nadded a test for this in test_series.py. I couldn't find a good place\nfor it so I put it behind the test_constructor_map case.\n\nThe test suite produces some failures: in test_series, line 1999, e.g.,\nSeries.name is set to a list type. That's mean, so I've made it a\nstring. This does not break that test, it is about repr.\n\nStill there are 13 failures and one error out of 8027 tests. At least\none failure relates to Series.name. Unfortunately I am fairly unfamiliar\nwith nose and unittest. Before attempting to fix these failures I\nthought I'd show you what I've done so far. \n\n Please let me know your views on the test results and what it would\ntake to accept the PR.\n\nAs this is my very first PR for a serious project, I am somewhat baffled\nabout how much work it takes to put together good software :-O. \n\nAnyway, so far it has been fun to work on this and I've learnt quite a bit.\n\nThanks.\n\nLeo\n\nAm 05.01.2015 um 23:44 schrieb Joris Van den Bossche:\n\n> There was recently introduced a |pd.core.common.is_hashable()| in this\n> PR: #8929 https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/8929.
