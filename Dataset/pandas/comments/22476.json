Their `__eq__` returns a boolean\r\n2. They're hashable\r\n\r\nCategoricalDtype.categories fails on both those counts, so the default implementation would work for it, but that's fine. I think that's a less common case.\r\n\r\nThe downside is a tiny bit of duplication. We could do fancier things with metaclasses probably, but that seems like overkill."

In the same spirit, @jreback commented on my first attempt at sets (without using an extension array) in https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/21547#issuecomment-399400329:\r\n> EA is an extension array & a dtype, both of which are first class. That's how I'd like to see sets (and lists and dicts)\r\n\r\nEDIT: If need be, I guess the backend could use an array of `frozenset` or even `tuple`, but that wouldn't be my first choice, as it makes implementing the methods much more cumbersome."
