    "body": "> would rather we fix the inline warnings!\r\n\r\nI will _gladly_ make this PR.\r\n\r\nTotally happy to not-add complexity.  Really asking for my own edification (and hopefully understanding this will make me less likely to screw up future PRs).  Specific questions about two examples and then I'll drop this.\r\n\r\nSuper-simple example is `_libs.tslibs.timezones` which doesn't import any other cython, so adding `'include': []` to this entry (so it doesn't get set to the default `common_include`) doesn't break anything.  The question: does trimming down the `include_dirs` arg lead to any savings (presumably at compile-time)?\r\n\r\nFor the other direction let's look at `_libs.tslibs.frequencies`.  This module has cimport dependencies on `cython, numpy` and `util`.  `util` relies on `numpy_helper.h` and `headers/stdint.h`.  If we were so inclined, how would we specify _exactly_ the needed dependencies and not the kitchen sink?"
