We don't even have the required modules in the dependencies we use to build the docs:\r\n\r\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/r_interface.html\r\n\r\nAs the functionality being documented is not on pandas but on `rpy2`, and nobody complained about the page giving errors everywhere, what I'd do is simply remove the page from the docs. One of the reasons I think it's better to delete the page instead of fixing the problem, is that fixing the problem implies installing more than 50 additional dependencies (required by rpy2) in the builds and in our local development environments.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound reasonable?"

So in the dev build it is back to the above error: http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/r_interface.html), and @TomAugspurger has a working environment locally to built them correctly, but I suppose he never uploaded updated docs: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/22777#issuecomment-423156273\r\n\r\nSo I think it is *possible* to have correctly built docs online (the doc were also correct up to 0.23.3, only started failing from 0.23.4). \r\n\r\nThat said, I am certainly not against removing it from our doc build (whether it is removing completely, or just removing the fact that the examples are run during the doc build)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
