    "body": "Yes, the main part of this bug report was a user error, since I didn't\nreplace the df.\n\nThe matplotlib error was apparently because matplotlib doesn't like being\ngiven incompatible datasets (time and float) to be displayed on the same\naxis.  It worked if I used a secondary y axis, and I posted the code that\nworks in a follow-up comment to a separate bug report, and closed both of\nthese.\n\nI've been watching your presentations all week and trying out many\nexamples.   Thanks very much.\n\nOn Sun, November 25, 2012 17:47, Wes McKinney wrote:\nUser error or?\n\n---\n\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/2356#issuecomment-10700575\n"
