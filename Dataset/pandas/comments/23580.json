It doesn't generate the plot, so it isn't directly about visualization (like @jreback noted).\r\n\r\nI'm using it for preprocessing with a few more steps before a plot, usually. Sometimes it's just for processing.\r\n\r\n@jreback: I did play with pandas.cut a bit before submitting this PR. If I recall correctly, it required a few extra steps to get the output to the form I needed, while simply wrapping numpy.histogram didn't.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to open an issue later this week to discuss further and to give some examples.\r\n\r\nIf you would rather have it implemented using pandas.cut, I'm open to that, too."
