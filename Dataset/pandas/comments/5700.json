    "body": "Okay this one can sit until 0.14 has started and I can add a release notes entry. I got on a bit of DRYness run, so I ended up combining the `KdePlot` and `CDFPlot` into a `DistributionPlot` class.\n\nI've only used statsmodels for the actual fitting of the cdf. Scipy doesn't provide a cdf on their kde object, so we'd have to duplicate the code that @jseabold linked to above. May as well just use what they've done.\n\nAnd of course if this has fallen out of scope for pandas then close without merging!\n"
