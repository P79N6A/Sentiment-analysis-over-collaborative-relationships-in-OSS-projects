    "body": "I disagree with not raising for the default value is how it is typically done. I think it is rather the other way around (we normally put the deprecated kwarg to a default of None, to be able to distinguish the default and an actual user passed value). This is also how the `deprecate_kwarg` decorator works. \r\n\r\nIt might be that we just missed a few of those cases while reviewing in the PRs where you deprecated something, and so you have the impression that this is not the typical way deprecations are done (and likewise it is possible that I only reviewed mainly those PRs where we do it this way and thus I have the opposite impression)\r\n\r\nOf course this issue is only relevant for a certain part of the deprecations (eg it is not relevant for deprecating/renaming kwargs that have no default value, or for changing a default value, or for deprecating/renaming a full method/class). \r\nLet me go through the relevant ones for 0.21 release:\r\n\r\n- `read_excel` sheetname -> sheet_name kwarg rename, with a default of 0: this raises the warning when you pass `sheetname=0` (as it is how the `deprecate_kwarg` decorator works)\r\n- `take` method `convert` kwarg: not raising for `convert=True` (IMO this should be fixed)\r\n- `raise_on_errors` kwarg in `where` with default of True: raises for the default (if you look at the implementation, it actually does `if raise_on_error is not None: ... [raise warning]`)\r\n\r\nIt is true that it is making the signature less informative, but I think we need to have this warning, as it is the purpose of the warning that people can change their code *before* it breaks.
