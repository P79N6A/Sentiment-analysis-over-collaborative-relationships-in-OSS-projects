Also, if at all possible, could you\nstrip out the trailing whitespace in your tests? :)\n\n```\ngit remote add upstream https://www.github.com/pydata/pandas.git\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout upstream/master\ngit cherry-pick bc82745\ngit branch str_extract_backup str_extract\ngit checkout -b str_extract\ngit push origin --force\n```\n\nAlso, could you add at least one test case that creates something with\nunicode and make sure that works without issue?\n\nOther notes, you don't need to check for isinstance with DataFrame because\n`assert_frame_equal` will do that for you already.\n\nFinally, we'd discussed using named match groups and converting those into\nnamed columns. Did you incorporate that here? Can you add a test case for\nthat?\n\nAlso, need to test what happens if you make a match group optional. I.e.\nuseful to have is something like this\n`(?P<kind>[LE])?_?(?P<intensity>[0-9]+)`. I think this is totally trivial\nbased on how you've set it up, but just useful to have in there.\n\nOne thing that I was wondering with reading your changes: would it make\nmore sense to just create list of lists instead of Series? Seems like that\nwould have less overhead. Similarly, maybe have empty_row just start our\nwith nans?\n"
