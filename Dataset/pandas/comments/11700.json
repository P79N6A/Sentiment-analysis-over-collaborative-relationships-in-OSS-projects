Summarizing some elements here:\r\n\r\n**Barriers**: some missing features are needed before such a replacement is possible (see also some elements in https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/11610)\r\n\r\n* truncated display\r\n* writing to a file (#13379)\r\n\r\n**Advantages**:\r\n\r\n* would eliminate a lot of code that gives similar functionality (`HTMLFormatter`, possibly other formatters) -> converging to one formatting system\r\n\r\n**Disadvantages**:\r\n\r\n* formally adding jinja2 as a dependency.\r\n* performance?\r\n  * plain html rendering on dataframe of 10 columns /10,000 rows of floats: `df.style.render()`: 19.6 s vs `df.to_html()` 2.7 s\r\n  * for notebook reprs (which are typically truncated) this will probably not be a problem\r\n\r\ncc @TomAugspurger For basic html output / notebook repr, it would maybe be useful to have a base class that has a simpler template and does not support all the different customization methods? For example, I can imagine that leaving out all the ``id=..`` (which are not needed for basic display I think?) can improve perf / simplify things."

This wouldn't really be implementing `df.to_html` using `.style`.\r\nInstead we'd have a common Jinja2 template that would handle the logic of iterating over rows, inserting tags.\r\nThen `.to_html()` and `.style` would extend that base template. `.to_html` probably wouldn't change much from the base really.\r\n\r\nAlso, Jinja depends on MarkupSafe, so that becomes another dependency."
