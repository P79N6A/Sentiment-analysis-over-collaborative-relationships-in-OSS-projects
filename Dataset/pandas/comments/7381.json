    "body": "Looks like it's fixed, but still good to have the issue documented. Switching versions to address these things is a pain when you might not want to accept some other non-backwards-compatible changes. This was a problem that prevented me from adopting anything newer than 0.8 until 0.13. I assume many others (especially when developing in work production environments) use pandas with little ability to suddenly change version too. It would be neat to have a \"long-term stable\" version concept, much like Ubuntu releases, for Pandas... such that patches would be developed for some milestone older versions based on the fixes in newer versions.\n"

    "body": "Here it is #5361!\n\nI think the idea is to firm up the API (for a 1.0 release?), IMO there are too many bug fixes in each release for anyone to manage \"bug-fix\" commit patches into some kind of \"stable version\". (This management of bug-fixes into multiple releases is a **lot** of work for Ubuntu!)\n\nI recommend testing your code each new release (the rc and .0 release) as it comes out, and then ~~raising hell~~ posting here if something is no longer working... that way it can be addressed for the .1 release (and you'll have the option to upgrade production to that). The aim is that changes should depreciate (with a warning suggesting a replacement) rather than break completely... if that isn't happening file an issue!\n"
