When using pandas, I tend to use per-column bound `strptime` or `dateutil.parse` functions if I need to handle a mixture of date formats, but obviously that doesn't work in all instances.\n\nI'm hoping that resolving dateutil/dateutil#125 (plus dateutil/dateutil#214) will be of some help here. I've long felt that the \"black box\" nature of the parser is causing the growth of an unpleasantly complicated set of toggles to tell the parser how to handle various ambiguities, particularly because we only return \"here's the date I found\" rather than \"here's the date I found - it only had a year and a month, is that what you wanted?\"\n"
