    "body": "> But more in general, can you actually give a use case ? I mean a small example where you see the effect of the keyword?\r\nI haven't been able to make one, and it also seems you didn't have to change any test (the one test you changed, there the keyword has no effect at all). Just wondering, probably I am missing something, but if not I would rather deprecate completely without adding alternative.\r\n\r\nthis really doesn't change anything; just had to fix some actual calls that causes the deprecation warning. The point of this is make things consistent. In the future I actually do want to change the defaults I think (and make 'coerce') possible. This is just conforming things a bit."
