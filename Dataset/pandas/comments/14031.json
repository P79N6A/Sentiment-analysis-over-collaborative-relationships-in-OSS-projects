    "body": "@jreback as this repo squashes all commits, I think this is the only place where such a problem description makes sense? Or do you have a script which does not take the initial PR message into account?\n\nJust giving an example why I think such a description is nice (I just took the latest commit at the time of writing this; sorry @sinhrks that it's one of yours, a lot of others look the same):\n\n```\nTST: Fix test_coercion for period dtype\nxref #13941.\n\nAuthor: sinhrks <sinhrks@gmail.com>\n\nCloses #14025 from sinhrks/test_coercion_period and squashes the following commits:\n\nb873683 [sinhrks] TST: Fix test_coercion for period dtype\n```\n\nThis actually gives no idea what was wrong here and why the new behaviour is the right one. The original commit only has a message (\"TST: Fix test_coercion for period dtype\"), no description; the PR  #14025 has basically no explaination at all; the xrefed issue is actually another PR (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/13941) which also has also no clean description what the problem is and only mentioned that it is \"split from https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/13755\" which then mentions what has to be done to get that PR merged, but again has no mention what the actual problem is whch that PR tries to fix.\n\nI'm not sure how you know why all this changes are needed and what the context is, but for me as an outside contributor is not clear at all why changes are done, especially when looking at the changes half year or more later. During the Categorical fixes, I spent quite a lot of time trying to understand why changes were done (\"Is that behaviour really just by accident or is that by design\") and in most of the cases I found only such uninformative commit messages as above :-(\n\nIMO to make decisions/changes more comprehensible (and also to make it easier for newcomers to understand things) it would be nice if changes could be better documented in the actual commits.\n"
