    "body": "This is just refactoring the reading for now. We should be able to support writing to s3 buckets pretty easily now too. A few things\n- pandas accepts `s3://`, `s3n://`, and `s3a://` protocols, but s3fs only expects the regular s3://. I work around that [here](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/13137/files#diff-0d7b5a2c72b4dfc11d80afe159d45ff8R251). [This](https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/AmazonS3) was the best source I found on the differences, but I don't know if simply chaning the protocol will break anything. At the end of the day we're just pulling down bytes, which should presumably represent a CSV\n- API Changes: Before we raised OSError when the s3 file wasn't found, and reraised botos PermissionError when you didn't have permission to read the file. I think s3fs exposes both of these as IOErrors [here](https://github.com/dask/s3fs/blob/master/s3fs/core.py#L631). We might be able to work around this\n\ncc @jreback @martindurant\n"

It could be an issue with permissions, but I suspect it's going to continue to come up.\n\nE.g., I can do this\n\n```\nimport boto3\nsession = boto3.Session(profile_name='myprofile')\ns3 = session.client('s3')\nkey = s3.get_object(Bucket=BUCKET, Key=KEY)\n```\n\nbut not \n\n```\nimport s3fs\nfs = s3fs.S3FileSystem(profile_name='myprofile')\nf = fs.open('s3://' + BUCKET + '/' + KEY)\n```\n\nand I don't see a way to set the profile explicitly in S3File and it doesn't seem to matter if I set my `AWS_PROFILE` correctly, but I haven't gone deep here.\n\n[1] https://github.com/dask/s3fs/issues/38\n"

To be fair, it looks like the `S3File` objects avoid some of the problems that I've been running in to with permissions.\n\nThis is probably out of scope for this PR, but I've often wanted to be able to pass a boto(3) `Key` object to `read_csv` rather than having to check how pandas is doing the session creation. If `S3File` is sufficiently file-like I'd love to skip the discovery and make me an s3 client steps, so I don't have to remind myself.\n"
