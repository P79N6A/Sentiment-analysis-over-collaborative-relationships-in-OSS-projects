    "body": "Maybe I'm missing something, but I see no \"partial\" string slicing: I just see slicing with start/stop bounds not present in the index, not differently from what happens with\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nIn [11]: df.loc['academia':'dadaism']\r\nOut[11]: \r\n        col\r\nadam      0\r\nandrew    0\r\nben       0\r\nbrad      0\r\ncal       0\r\nchad      0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is something perfectly natural when you are dealing with datetimes or ints, a bit less with strings, as @gfyoung rightly suggests; still, I don't think there is anything it makes sense to forbid. The docs, by the way, never state that start and stop bounds must be present, except maybe (implicitly) when [they say](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html) that they are _included in the results_. So unless I'm missing something we should just change the sentence \"When slicing, the start bound is included, AND the stop bound is included\" with \"When slicing, the start bound, AND the stop bound are included, if present.\".\r\n\r\nAnalogously, few lines later, \"(note that contrary to usual python slices, both the start and the stop are included!)\" should become \"(note that contrary to usual python slices, both the start and the stop are included, if present!)\""

It describes a general behaviour which, as far as I can tell, is always honoured by pandas, regardess of the dtype of the index.

There is no such thing as \"partial string indexing\": everyone is free to see it from his/her preferred perspective, but in the ``pandas`` logics (and docs, when it will be documented) it is just \"indexing with labels which do not appear in the index\", regardless of the dtype.
