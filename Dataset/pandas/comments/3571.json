    "body": "I would like to be able to round trip, so that if I write a CSV file with multi-indexed columns and read that back in I get the same multi-indexed columns.  In addition it would be nice if the indices (if that’s the correct word) were written to different rows, so that when I read this into something like Excel it looks good.  What’s not clear to me is where to write the names of the index in the case where both your row and columns indices have names.  Currently the row index names are written to the 1st row, but that doesn’t leave space to write the last column index name.  I’m not sure what the answer is to that L.\n\nFrom: Phillip Cloud [mailto:notifications@github.com] \nSent: Friday, May 10, 2013 5:12 PM\nTo: pydata/pandas\nCc: Paul Blelloch\nSubject: Re: [pandas] Improve Reading and Writing of Multi-Index Columns (#3571)\n\nOne issue is that it's not clear when you're reading a csv file whether you just want tuples or u want a MultiIndex (which is why I linked to #3323 https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/3323 ).\n\n—\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/3571#issuecomment-17750660 .  https://github.com/notifications/beacon/IfmwiDcU97mlVHGwebrm7igu51JLaFYiIAhP9L6hD4-2TvbIrP8fFW1F3iKemvwI.gif\n"
