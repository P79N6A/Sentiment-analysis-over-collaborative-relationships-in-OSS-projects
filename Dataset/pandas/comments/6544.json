    "body": "@jreback this reminds me: I was looking at `BlockManager` implementation the other day and it seemed to me that it was too busy micromanaging type coercions & casts. I though that pandas could benefit by wrapping all the nasty `numpy` interaction details in a single module that would provide a `pdarray` subclass of `np.ndarray` with all the necessary casts and workarounds already applied (i.e. boxing/unboxing values, proper datetime parsing, type inference).  It could also provide basic building blocks for more advanced algorithms, e.g. pandas-dtype-aware concatenation. \n\nThis seems an obvious application of single responsibility principle, did anyone consider/start doing this before? Were there any pitfalls that prevented that?\n"

For a person outside of project's scope all that magic is impossible to follow, because they're distributed evenly all over the code base.\n\nThis would require proxying all objects and function imports that may relate to numpy via some `pdnumpy` package. This is quite a project, like you say, but it would demarcate an area inside `pandas` and within that area everything would behave exactly as expected. This would allow to abstract away those gory details and focus more on the actual value added by `pandas`.  Do you agree?\n"

    "body": "@immerrr makes sense. Though one could argue that these are these are actually conventions that pandas uses to deal with numpy. Not bugs per se, but more 'workarounds' to treat things in a nicer manner (e.g. taking views on datetime64[ns] and such). IMHO this would only be useful as a layer above numpy, but I am not sure of the utilitiy for non-pandas (my 2c).\n\nCentralizing this would be a very nice feature as they _are_ pretty scattered. I am all for elegant code, so I would be +1 on this. \n\nTheir was some code in `core/array.py` to proxy out `ndarray` in general (should prob be removed as its only used in a very way and doesn't really do anything, side -issue). The series not a sub of ndarray mostly 'fixed' the need for this (as pandas I don't think can really ever divorce from numpy).\n"
