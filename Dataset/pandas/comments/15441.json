We shouldn't be coupling together `squeeze` and `usecols` behavior.  The flags should be as independent of one another as possible.  While I understand the rationale, from a design standpoint, I would be against this."

    "body": "I agree with @gfyoung on the squeeze. I also understand this would be nice, but it is not that it makes new behaviour possible, it just for saving a few keystrokes (`squeeze=True`). In that light, I don't find adding more complexity to the `usecols` keyword worth this (and `squeeze=True` is also more explicit).\r\n\r\nRegarding accepting a scalar, I have less an opinion about that. Probably not much harm, but I also don't really see the need (the current docs are very clear: either array-like or callable, which is more clear than scalar, array-like or callable)"

Sure if if someone wants to do it, I think we would accept it."
