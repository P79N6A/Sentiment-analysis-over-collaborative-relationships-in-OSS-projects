    "body": "I don't mind that it is not possible (yet) but that read_csv changed the datatype even as I specified it and didn't say anything (throw exception or print warning). \n\npandas/src/pasrer.pyx has commented out [exception throwing in line 900](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/src/parser.pyx#L900), which seems to do what I expected...? \n\nWould it be posible to add a param to specify a strategy (drop row, throw exception, cast to float) what should happen with such cases? I tried to understand the code and it seems that it operates on columns, so dropping rows if an int is NA seems not an easy option :-(\n"
