One of my arguments for using `tm.assert_raises_regex` is that you can get a better idea of WHY code should fail beyond just the exception being raised.\r\n\r\nSo sure, I don't think all of them need to be converted, but I still do think `tm.assert_raises_regex` should be preferred by default.  How does that sound?"
