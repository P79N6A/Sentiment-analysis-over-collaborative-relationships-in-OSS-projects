The downside is i had to check dtypes for numpy.object and remove any \\n for my particular use case. i find the data i work with has some text fields with \\n in them, breaking the csv write. Maybe theres a better way to incorporate the removal of \\n in any strings found inside of dataframe.to_csv, then checking dtypes and  csv wouldnt be needed. \n"

    "body": "@y-p You can use the raw SQL in the new API\nI really don't think anything should be added to the legacy code - that's sort of the point of it being \"legacy\". We already have a slightly confused situation where we have \"legacy support\"  which takes care of SQLite/MySQL without the SQLAlchemy dependancy but which uses the new OOP architecture - this is different from \"sql_legacy.py\" which just has the old stuff in it.\n\nWhat would be better would be to enhance the new system with DB-specific code in special cases. For example we could detect when Postgres is being used and issue a COPY FROM statement instead of SELECT. SQLAlchemy would still be very useful in that it provides type information through table reflection so we can do appropriate type convertions.\n\nSo I would suggest stabilizing the new code first and then introducing performance optimizaitons later.\n"
