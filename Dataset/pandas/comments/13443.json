That is the logical use for this name, and that is what makes the 'other' levels a confusing name.\n\nBTW, I also think that the current repr is not the best one. As @shoyer put, the levels/labels are 'mostly internal', so then we shouldn't show them by default in repr? But will open a separate issue for that. **EDIT** -> https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/13480\n"

I know implementation wise (`codes`/`labels` and `categories`/`levels`) they are very similar, but for a lot of users, I don't think they see it that way. So calling it categories may be confusing as well. \n(although, since we are just arguing it is more internal-like, it maybe does not matter that much)\n"

    "body": "Hey @jorisvandenbossche, I'm thinking about the repr output and doc strings here. If it weren't for #22511, the repr output would change from  ``MultiIndex(..., labels=...)`` to ``MultiIndex(..., codes=...)``, while #22511 changes the repr in a different way. So these two issues are connected through the repr output, through test touching the repr output and examples of MultiIndex usage in the doc string in various locations...\r\n\r\nI had a working implementation of this a week ago (locally, was not pushed), so should be easy to update, but would prefer to get the repr issue settled before pushing.

    "body": "@topper-123 I think you could ignore the repr here (only change the internals and the method/attribute names, and leave the repr alone). Of course we need to change the repr eventually, but since you have the other PR, I would not worry about it here. \r\nSo I would recommend to already push your working implementation into a PR, so we can already start reviewing it (we can still later decide which PR to merge first)."
