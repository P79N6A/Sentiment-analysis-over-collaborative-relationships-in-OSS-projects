    "body": "Thanks for the pointer! I'm using the fact that FWF files are rectangular, so you can simply mmap or read the file into a known byte array in numpy. After that, optimization is simplified to conversion between numpy and pandas, with conversion to heterogeneous column types handled on the pandas side (there is no sensible way to convert types within a numpy recarray without copying the whole array).\r\n\r\nI don't think you'd be able to do much better writing a cython (or other bespoke) FWF reader than mapping the file to a numpy array of bytes, but I could be wrong. My approach is brittle to missing bytes, which I think `read_fwf` can handle better given it's line-oriented approach."
