    "body": "xref is #3539 \n\nyou _could_ do this in an index, as we can easily store meta data, but not currently for a column (that would require a meta dict in the BlockManager).\n\nNote have to be sure to invalidate these on any setting operations.\n\nNote that IIRC the index cython object DOES cache these things, e.g. `is_monotonic`, so not sure how much this would actually change it. (I am talking about if the index IS sorted, then you don't have to recompute it again). This issue is different though.\n"
