    "body": "I'm going to close this is as a duplicate of #15836  You are are right that the floats are being treated as ordinals - #15836 would have it raise an error unless a unit was specified as this behavior can be surprising.  So agree this should be fixed!\r\n\r\nThat said, as a general rule - you should expect different dtypes to do different things.  `'1995'` and `1995.0` are rarely interchangeable in pandas."
