I was thinking of a `to_datetime` parameter for setting the origin, as Stata formats aren't the only place that this occurs, and R has such a parameter (presumably for the same reason).\r\n\r\nI often see it when moving data around or pulling it from sources that have a Stata export option, and those often don't come with the date formatting intact. I tend to use those export options (often with Stata for co-author accessibility), assemble data in pandas (R in the past), and then export it in Stata format for sharing and analysis. "
