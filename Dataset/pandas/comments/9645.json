    "body": "@jorisvandenbossche : The reason it isn't in the C engine is because we rely on Python's `csv` library to do the sniffing for us.  This could easily be transferred to the C engine, but is that _too much_ coupling between the CParser and the PythonParser?  I am not sure.  On the one hand, the implementation would be faster in C, but the library's Python implementation is _very_ detailed in terms of its determination of sniffed delimiter.  Is it worth trying to replicate such an implementation in C?\n\ncc @jreback \n"
