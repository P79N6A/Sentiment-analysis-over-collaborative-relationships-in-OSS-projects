Furthermore people often want to simply assign an attribute e.g. `df.name = 'foo'` or whatever, so very tricky to figure out what is needed (e.g. is that an additional column?)\n\nIMHO the assignment should be completely banned and only allow read-only access, but I may be in a minority view.\n\ndupe of this issue: https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/6160\n"
