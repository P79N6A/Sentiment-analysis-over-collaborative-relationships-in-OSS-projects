The current doc [0] states \"Asymmetrical error bars are also supported, however raw error values must be provided in this case. For a M length Series, a Mx2 array should be provided indicating lower and upper (or left and right) errors.\" which is, as noted in #9536 not working. Still, after this commit the documented syntax is changed from 2xM to Mx2 as is the format matplotlib expects asymmetrical error bars. So probably it makes sense to document it as an API change.\nI did add some more documentation on the docstring and the undocumented feature of providing a single number to use for every error bar.\nI also did add a test.\n\n[0] http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html#visualization-errorbars\n[1] http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.errorbar\n"

I hope this is the right place?\n\nRegarding your [line comment](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/12046#discussion-diff-50161835R1472) \n\n> I would like to see a more general soln here, rather than specific ndim checking.\n\ni have no idea how to do that. The fix is for one specific case: Only one Series to plot, with error bars given as raw values in an array of shape 2xN. I don't know to come up for a more general solution for this special case. \nThe more general solution is available in the form of Mx2xN arrays which can be already used for plotting asymmetric error bars for M multiple values of dataframes. \nFor Series it is already possible to use this general solution by providing a 1x2xN shaped array for asymmetric error bars. \nBut i would argue this is counterintuitive as the [matplotlib api](http://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.errorbar) uses the 2xN format and i, as well as others #9536, http://stackoverflow.com/q/26793758/4262879 did expect that the pandas API would work the same. \n"
