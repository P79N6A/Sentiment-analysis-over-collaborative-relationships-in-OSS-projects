Those of us who answer a lot of questions on SO, for example, regularly have to use `sep=\"\\s\\s+\"` to parse text which people have dumped in a whitespace-separated format, and we have to hope they've put enough spaces between columns for that to work.  If they were using commas, or semicolons, or pipes, or something, this wouldn't be a problem.

They should both be supported. @dsm054 brings up some compelling advantages to non-whitespace delimiters.\r\n\r\nA bigger issue in my opinion is using the `.csv` extension indiscriminately (e.g. when referring to TSVs). See discussion at https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/14587. I agree with @stevekm that `to_table` should be a generic function where you should specify your delimiter, while `to_csv` or `to_tsv` should focus on those standards. Going about this in a backwards compatible would take some forethought. But at least pandas 2 should consider function names along the lines of [readr](http://readr.tidyverse.org/)."
