IMO this is not the good direction. For new code / refactors, I think we should stick to: only what is public can go in the top-level namespace. \r\n\r\nLet's take the example of `types`. We now have a private `pandas.types` and a public `pandas.api.types`, so the less nested location is private, which I don't find ideal. \r\nIf we use the approach of `pandas.api.types`, I think we should at least make the actual implementation in `pandas._types`, so you don't have the two publicly visible locations. \r\nThe other option is to make put now what is in `pandas.api.types`, in `pandas.types` (while the exact implementation and organization in the different submodules of `pandas.types` remains a private implementation detail).\r\n"

    "body": "Here's my rationale:\r\n\r\nWe have 3 stakeholders.\r\n\r\n- users: regular folks who do ``import pandas as pd``\r\n- library builders / advanced users: folks who need more 'library' code\r\n- implementation\r\n\r\n``implementation``: this may seem strange to mention, but *pandas* is a large library. We need the flexibility to move code around, expand modules, rename and generally get stuff done internally, with out having to constantly deprecate things. This would be extremely disruptive to the public (not to mention burdensome).\r\n\r\nFor example. ``pandas.types`` exists with several sub-modules that are logically defined, simply named and concise. There is not reason a for 'users' or 'library' writers to access this at all. It exists simply to organize the code. Sure they can reach in if they really want, but we want to discourage this. Making it ``pandas._types`` would surely do this, but that is an ugly name and since this is pure python code a bit misleading.\r\n\r\n'users': they are served by the top-level ``pd`` namespace, supplemented by ``pandas.errors``. Everything that one could need is here (or as a method).\r\n\r\n'library': these folks need code generally for instrospection that is just too cumbersome to be in a 'user' namespace. Things like ``is_integer_dtype`` is a canonicial way to introspect things in pandas. We *use* these internally and provide them as an external API to library writers.\r\n\r\nI recently added ``pandas.api.lib`` with ``infer_dtype``, which is a useful routine, again to external library writers. This is (or another sub-module of ``pandas.api``) can also be the home of a c-api / development api.\r\n\r\nSo, everything as public is just fine. If someone wants to reach in and use a routine from ``pandas.format.*`` or whatever they should have no expectations that this is stable across releases.\r\n\r\nFor simplicity from a user AND a library pov, its much better to have a single namespace ``pandas.api`` that say: hey they routines are what I should use, they are documented and won't change\r\n"

Certainly we should group more things into submodules: this makes it easier to find related functionality.\r\n\r\nOne choice that would make this super clear is move all internal stuff into a top level submodule called `internals`, e.g., `pandas.internals.core`, `pandas.internals.indexes`, etc. Then if you're importing from `pandas.internals.something`, you know it's an internal routine. Otherwise, as a user it's not obvious whether `pandas.something` exists to as a namespace to logically group together the `something` routines or if it's an internal implementation detail."

I don't think it is that problematic there is a bit ugliness there, and IMO worth the clarity (if we use the `pandas.api` approach). \r\nThe `internals` namespace is also a possiblity, but this is actually more or less what `core` is currently.
