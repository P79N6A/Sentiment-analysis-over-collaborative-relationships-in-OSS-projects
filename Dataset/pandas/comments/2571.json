    "body": "I'm putting in a hack for this now so for 'H' it'll keep it as DatetimeIndex and not perform the PeriodIndex conversion. DatetimeIndex has much more functionality not in the PeriodIndex so more and more restrictions are coming up in plotting in order to retain the tick labeling. Probably the answer is to redo the tick labelling so it doesn't rely on Periods at all.\n"
