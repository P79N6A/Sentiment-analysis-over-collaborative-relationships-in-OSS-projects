    "body": "For what it's worth, I was calculating percent differences in a class today and had a student use this function. They neglected to multiply by 100 because they didn't check the docs (and I was surprised myself at the behavior after reading them). I used it as a good teachable moment for why you should _always_ check the docs, but I don't think that's a particularly good reason for keeping it that way. I volunteer to make the change if you're open to it, but I have to agree with sunilshah here that the standard definition of percent change is out of 100."

    "body": "We just came across this too, when a student asked why the values weren't percents.  I can't say why people have not complained, but it's very confusing to see that the method is called `pct_change` and there is \"percentage change\" through the docstring, when in fact it is fractional change.   In particular you have:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPercentage change between the current and a prior element.\r\n\r\nComputes the percentage change from the immediately previous row by\r\ndefault. This is useful in comparing the percentage of change in a time\r\nseries of elements.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is just incorrect.   It should read:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFractional change between the current and a prior element.\r\n\r\n*Be careful* - despite the name of this method, it calculates fractional\r\nchange and not percentage change.\r\n\r\nComputes the fractional change from the immediately previous row by\r\ndefault. This is useful in comparing the fraction of change in a time\r\nseries of elements.\r\n\r\nIf you need the percentage change, multiply these values by 100.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the other instances of \"percent\" should be \"fraction\"."
