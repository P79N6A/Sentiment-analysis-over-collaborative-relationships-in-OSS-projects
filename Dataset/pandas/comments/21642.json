    "body": "@TomAugspurger Thanks for the response and info (I do admit that I was a bit lost as to who's doing what).\r\n\r\n> I don't think we're interested in messing with the CSS. That's best left to others (with the defaults set by the notebook). \r\n\r\nFor a casual user (including me for a long time), I believe it's a natural assumption that pandas is responsible for the rendering in IPython - even if that's an overly simplistic viewpoint. But as such, the first option a user will search for is adapting something _in pandas_. I can see why you don't want to mess with the defaults, but then I think there should be at least a `pd.set_option()` to switch off the whitespace-merging."
