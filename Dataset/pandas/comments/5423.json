The tests are like this:\n\n``` python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame([[7] *3, [8] *3, [9] *3])\ndf1.index.name = 'Foo'\n\ndf1.to_excel('merge30.xlsx', merge_cells=True)\n\nxf = pd.ExcelFile('merge30.xlsx')\ndf2 = xf.parse(xf.sheet_names[0], has_index_names=True)\n\ndf1 == df2\n\n>>> df1 == df2\n        0     1     2\nFoo\n0    True  True  True\n1    True  True  True\n2    True  True  True\n\n```\n\nSo that isn't round-tripping the MI, just the index names.\n"

    "body": "> Why do you need to use **getattribute** and **setattr** explicitly? Surprised to see that? \n\n``` python\n                           xcell = wks.cell(\"%s%s\" % (colletter, row))\n                           for field in style.__fields__:\n                               xcell.style.__setattr__(field, \\\n                                   style.__getattribute__(field))\n```\n\nYes, that is kind of janky. I copied that from the existing code above those lines. You would imagine that it should just be a function like:\n\n``` python\n    xcell.style = _convert_cell_style(cell.style)\n```\n\nI might look at refactoring the style/format handling as a separate PR in the 1.4 milestone and re-enable the commented out testcase for cell formats in test_`excel.py`. It probably isn't worth it for this PR though.\n"
