You want to return one group, but if there is nothing to group by, how can you have a group? Eg, how would you call this group? `None`? What would be the index of the resulting frame if you do eg `df.groupby(by=()).mean()`?\n"

    "body": "yeah, IIRC this is really to catch errors as there are multiple specifiers `by,axis,level`, so passing nothing is really a user error, where you want to fail fast.\n\nFurthermore @jorisvandenbossche point is that this would essentially give rise to a single NaN keyed group, which are currently excluded. I suppose if that were relaxed (a bit non-trivial actually, #443) then this might be realistic.\n"
