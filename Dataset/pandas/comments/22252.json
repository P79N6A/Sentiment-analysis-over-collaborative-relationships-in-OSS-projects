    "body": "~**Problem 2.**~ Thanks a lot for the link, very useful information (and not just regarding the mentioned problem). Actually, never noticed the problem before, until needed to write to a database recently and this changed the type of a column in the database after adding some missing values. So, this is not an issue anymore as this is by design. \r\n\r\n**Problem 1.** I am not sure I can do this now. If you assign it to me, I'll remember to look into it later. This is if you have no immediate plans to look into this yourself or assign someone else. \r\n"
