    "body": "this is just a passed thru argument (not in the doc-string). No checking is done on mode. Addtl args are passed thru to PyTables to support various forms of opening stores (e.g. in-memory).\n\nI suppose it could be checked, though this will be quite tricky. Stores are allowed to be opened in multiple processes in append/read-only mode. So I guess 'w' could be disallowed if mode is supplied. But passing tests will be a bit tricky.\n\na pull-request would be appreciated.\n"

However, this is the first time that I'm contributing to pandas, so I might need some guidance.\n\nAm I correct that the check for mode='w' should be added to the `read_hdf` function in pandas/io/pytables.py (line 268)? How this function ends up as an instance method of DataFrame is still a mystery to me.\n"
