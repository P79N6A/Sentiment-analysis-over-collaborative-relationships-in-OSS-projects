However, for use through this library, do you feel it would be better to authenticate in that manner and make it more suitable cross-platform?

The accepted form for this is an acknowledgment in the release notes\nby name or GH handle. We often do this unbidden when new contributors are involved to show \nour gratitude for their contribution to the project. \n\nSo, please remove the Authors line from the code and feel free to add a \"thanks to @sean-schaefer, Jacob Schaer\"\nnote to the appropriate item in RELEASE.rst file.\n"

    "body": "We could use <code>select count(*) from table</code> to get the total rows of the table being queried, but I'm not sure how helpful that would be for queries other than <code>select \\* from table</code>, and even in that case the results could be cached and return almost instantly. Querying all 4 million rows in a table may take 60 seconds, but if a limit was specified in the query it could only take a couple. \n\nIt's worth noting though that if your queries are this big, you run the risk of hitting one of the many other limitations within BigQuery: in particular, intermediate tables (required for groupings and joins) may not exceed 7MB; result sets may not exceed 128MB, and you may even get one of Google's lovely generic \"reply too large\" errors. For the datasets we've worked with, query time hasn't been a problem.\n"
