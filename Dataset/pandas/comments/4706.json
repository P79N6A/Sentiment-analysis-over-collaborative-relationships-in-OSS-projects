    "body": "To me, `imply_dst` is confusing as a term - it's not clear to me this would do, particularly because it looks like the equivalent `pytz` keyword accepts either `True` or `False`. I think you might mean that the dst is implied from the data, in which case `infer_dst` would make more sense as the keyword argument.\n\n It looks like pytz calls the marker for this [`is_dst`](http://pytz.sourceforge.net/#tzinfo-api):\n\n> The `is_dst` parameter is ignored for most timestamps. It is only used during DST transition ambiguous periods to resulve that ambiguity.\n\nIf you have some logic that somehow decides whether or not to infer dst (which I think is what you're doing), you could call it `infer_dst` and specify how you decide whether it should be `is_dst=True` or `is_dst=False`. It looks like you're inferring it based upon looking for ordering (i.e., occurring every hour or something) - if that's the case, it would be useful to add a minimal example to the docs that shows how pandas is or is not able to infer timezone. (i.e., something around here - http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/timeseries.html#time-zone-handling )\n\nIf `imply_dst` means that you do the equivalent of parsing every datetime as if you had passed `is_dst=True` to the pytz constructor, then it would make more sense to allow the value to be either `None`, `True` (or truthy) or `False` and then have it parse with the equivalent of `is_dst=False`, `is_dst=True` passed to the pytz constructor.  Probably would also make sense to change the name to `is_dst` and use something like the quoted doc above to explain it.\n"

    "body": "Hey @rockg + @jtratner\n\n@rockg nice start to this! I had a `.md` doc going that was attempting to explain how we should be able to infer from a time series for the same reason... just no time to implement! I looked through your source and tests and had just a few thoughts / questions.\n\n### the `tz_localize` error\n\nAttempts to localize time `DatetimeIndex` with `df.index.tz_localize(tz)` raise  both `NonExistentTimeError`, and `AmbiguousTimeError`, (both sub classes of `pytz.InvalidTimeError` base class) and arise for different reasons.\n- Your PR seems like it only addresses the `AmbiguousTimeError` encountered during DST Fall transition, is that correct? I also have use cases in parsing time series from a local tz when I hit an `NonExistentTimeError` for local timestamps formats that can be encountered during a DST Spring transition. For example:\n  \n  ``` python\n  import pytz\n  tz = pytz.timezone('US/Eastern')\n  tz.localize(pd.datetime(2012, 3, 11, 2, 00), is_dst=None)\n  ```\n  \n  raises  `NonExistentTimeError`. This is due to `pyzt`'s terse interpretation of the Olsen timezone database, which states, explicitly, that the DST transition occurs at `02:00:00`, (only allowing for timestamps advances like:  `01:59:59` to `03:00:00`). Thus, any formatting practice that instead performs an advance like `02:00:00` to `03:00:01`, fails. This might seem like a unique case, but trust me, in my line of work, this type of local timestamp formatting can be found everywhere. :(\n- Does the PR handle timestamp frequencies less than hourly? In this case, the repeated timestamp count would be equal to the number of sub-hourly frequency (I saw a control flow for number of repeated hours?).\n\nHope that all makes sense! Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for tackling this, it's going to be very useful!\n"

    "body": "You are correct that this only addresses the Ambiguous error that occurs in the fall transition.  I understand your example (it's second-ending time rather than second-beginning, e.g., the time from 1:59:59 or 2:00:00 can really be represented as either 1:59:59 or 2:00:00 as it is really representing the span between).  This is always a choice when determining how to represent times and it would be nice if pytz was more flexible.  I don't have any easy thoughts here besides changing your times to be second-beginning which I'm sure you thought of.\n\nFrequencies less than an hour are supported.  The code just looks for a negative diff in times (i.e., a time repeated in the hour) and assumes that these are for the non-dst hour.  If there is no such diff, then you still have ambiguous times.  I think this logic will work for the vast majority of the cases.  Can you point your reference to the number of repeated hours?\n"
