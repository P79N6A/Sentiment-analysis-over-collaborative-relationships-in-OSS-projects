I guess I could special case the two options, but that would be kind of convoluted right?  If I'm special casing for the 2 cases, I might as well keep the original two functions separate.\n"

    "body": "Hmmm... I'm struggling with this one.\n\nAttempt 2 to move this into `NDFrame` is no dice.  You said above I could use the non-info axes to reindex and \"For a frame this will yield (0), and a panel (1,2)\".  But actually, the axes I need to reindex is (1) for a DataFrame and (1,2) for a Panel...   \n\nNow that would not be hard to do by just doing a for loop and starting from 1 and incrementing up, but that seems like a convoluted way to tackle this. \n\nAny ideas?  Moving the functionality up to the base class might save some lines of code and is certainly clever, but keeping the reindexing in the derived classes wins in terms of simpleness.  Am I missing an advantage of moving to the base class?\n"
