Everything was setup to be sequential so after you checkout, then you either work on the docs or the code and then you commit.  So I think both the contributing to docs/code should be on same level as those two other things (and the rest of the workflow).\n\nMaybe what we should be doing here is to pull out the `Contributing to the Code Base` into a separate .rst file and then only convert that subfile into contributing.md.  I think that is really the relevant section for ensuring a pull request is following the project's guidelines.  I can play around with that.\n"
