    "body": "@gfyoung so my issue with this is the following.\n\nin the current code all handling of `errors=` for both Timedelta and Timestamp parsing (e.g. things like `array_to_datetime`) is almost exclusively handled in the cython path. \n\nThe main reason of course is that by-definition `errors='coerce'` needs this (as we are in a cython loop and need to continue while processing), while `errors='ignore'` is generally a try/except around this code (it still tries to process by now returns an `object` array).\n\nSo while your approach seems ok, it now changes the way a reader has to understand what is going on (in timedelta vs timestamp parsing). So I am open to changing things, just want to make them consistent. \n\nAlso I think its much easier to follow if its all in cython. No real reason to move it.\n"

For example, take a look at this line <a href=\"https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/tslib.pyx#L2622\">here</a>.  Why should `Timestamp` initialisation care about error handling?\n\nSecondly, there was no real error handling at the Cython level (this bug attests to that), and IMO that that shouldn't be black-boxed into Cython but rather exposed at the Python level like we do with `to_numeric` for clarity.  The Cython level should be for handling the actual conversion process (the meat of the function), while the Python level should be for how we handle the behaviour of the conversions.\n"

    "body": "@jreback : I'm not sure why it matters so much that the format be the same here.  What's the justification for keeping it?  Here is my justification for writing it the way I did.\n\nMy point is that the conversion process should be separated into two parts: 1) The actual conversion, and 2) How we handle errors.  The current implementation of `to_datetime` couples them all together, forcing us to make clumsy calls (i.e. <a href=\"https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/tslib.pyx#L2622\">here</a> as I mentioned above) where we have to specify error handling for no good reason at all.\n\nIn addition, the conversion process becomes littered with `try-except` blocks that arguably obfuscate what is happening at the Cython level.\n\nThe framework I have proposed here is exactly what happens in `to_numeric`, and it makes it nice and clear at the Python level what is happening when we do the conversion.  That same clarity is lacking in `to_datetime` and `to_timedelta`, so yes, my PR does change the way a reader has to understand what is going in `to_datetime` but IMO it is for the better.\n"

The main reason is that the Cython methods used in `to_datetime` are also exposed as Python methods (`cpdef`) unlike those in `to_timedelta`.  Thus, moving the error handling out of the Cython level would be an API change.\n"
