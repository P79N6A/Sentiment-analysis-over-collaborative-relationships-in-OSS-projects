    "body": "you are violating guarantees by reaching in an doing an assignment by using the internals. Almost all pandas operations return a copy as they are pure functions (exceptions are indexing assignment and _in-place_ operations).\n\nYou can pass `copy=False` when constructing a `DataFrame` with a 2-d numpy array to have no-copy semantics. This is also possible with a 1-d numpy array to a `Series`. Note that this is not a 100% guarantee on some dtypes, e.g. `object` and `datetimelikes`.\n\nAssigning to column of a frame always generates a copy. You can investigate `concat` with a `copy=False` flag if you want.\n"
