    "body": "Hi @y-p,\n\nThanks for pointing this out! I'd be glad to fix this. Just to be sure, is the concern with the signature mostly positional or keys (or both)? Being that the function now allows for multiple stock symbols, I thought it would be beneficial to have a name that reflected such, but perhaps this isn't good practice. \n\nThe function signature was previously:\n\n``` python\n get_data_yahoo(name=None, start=None, end=None, retry_count=3, pause=0)\n```\n\nThis PR contains changes as:\n\n``` python\nget_data_yahoo(symbols=None, start=None, end=None, adjust_price=False,\n                      ret_index=False, chunk=25, pause=0, **kwargs):\n```\n\nWould a change to the following be sufficient?\n\n``` python\nget_data_yahoo(name=None, start=None, end=None,  retry_count=3, pause=0, \n                       adjust_price=False, ret_index=False, chunk=25, pause=0, \n                       **kwargs):\n```\n\nWhen you can, let me know!\n\nThanks!\n"
