    "body": "Hey @abielr, \n\nI just came across this issue as I am also looking to expand functionality of the `PeriodIndex` to support multiples of DateOffsets, but it seems you've already tackled this in elegant way.\n\nBefore I totally dive in cloning your repo, I wanted to know the status of this project? Do you still use it with current pandas build `0.12`? Did this ever gain any traction with the pandas devs? It seems like a natural evolution of functionality in handling regularly-spaced time series information (especially handling those that happen to be multiples of date offsets). \n\nThank you. :)\n"
