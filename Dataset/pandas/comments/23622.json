    "body": "Got response, Azure is checking how many concurrent jobs they can give us, but they should be able to increase them. They asked me how many would we liked, those are my numbers:\r\n\r\nIf I'm not wrong we have 14 jobs in total (including travis...), and each takes around 30 minutes to complete. So, with 15 jobs (5 more than now) we would complete two builds per hour (assuming no other CI).\r\n\r\nYesterday we had 112 builds (this does not count the ones that should be auto-canceled when new commits are added to the same PR before the job is run). That's an average of 4.7 per hour.\r\n\r\nSo, as an approximate, I think with 30 jobs (4 builds per hour), with auto-cancel working, we'd do ok, even if we have everything in azure-pipelines.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has a different opinion, please let me know asap, so I can update Azure with it before they decide."
