Then we would:\r\n\r\n1) Make a note in `pd.Timedelta.resolution` that this is different from `datetime.timedelta`\r\n2) Create a separate property for `pd.Timedelta` to return `pd.Timedelta(nanoseconds=1)`\r\n\r\nIf we move forward with option 2 then yes it would be a breaking change. I would slightly prefer option 1 as well since it doesn't disrupt the current API."
