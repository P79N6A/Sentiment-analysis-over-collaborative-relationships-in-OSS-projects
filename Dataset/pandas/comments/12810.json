    "body": "@wesm in recent versions of numpy (like > 1.11), they are now wrapping all common functions that try to dispatch to 'duck-like' class that can handle (w/o directly using) `__array__`, so sub-classing (and duck-like behavior is preservered). not a bad thing actually. The problem is pandas has a different signature and this is not handled nicely (by numpy).\n\n```\nIn [1]: p = pd.SparseDataFrame([1, 2, 3])\n\nIn [2]: np.cumsum(p)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-2-74227eeed55a> in <module>()\n----> 1 np.cumsum(p)\n\n/Users/jreback/miniconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/fromnumeric.pyc in cumsum(a, axis, dtype, out)\n   2113     except AttributeError:\n   2114         return _wrapit(a, 'cumsum', axis, dtype, out)\n-> 2115     return cumsum(axis, dtype, out)\n   2116 \n   2117 \n\nTypeError: cumsum() takes at most 2 arguments (4 given)\n```\n- so we are forced to either accept some incompatibilities\n- outlaw this\n- ignore it\n- accomodate it by 'accepting' these arguments and ignoring them (while not showing them in the pandas signature). This is exacerbated a bit by numpy passing positional args, rather than kwargs.\n\nit IS unfortunate, and maybe numpy should just catch the `TypeError` around the `_wrap_it`.\n\nI think it is nicer to make it just work.\n"

So we should not be saying \"we are guaranteeing that pandas.Series and DataFrame are interchangeable with ndarray\".\n\nIn general, I don't think we should be encouraging more ndarray duck typing (for example, indexing will always behave a little differently because of indexes) -- we need to be able to control the behavior and semantics of pandas without being as dependent on NumPy as we have in the past.
