    "body": "> How do we see the 'legacy'?\n\nIn the long term, I'd like to keep full-fledged support for connections generated by `sqlite3`. For light applications, I still favor those over sqlalchemy for code portability (e.g., to collaborators who might not have sqlaclemy). Since all other flavors already require dependencies that are not built in to Python, I think it is reasonable to expect users to _also_ obtain sqlalchemy if they want the very best support. One man's opinion.\n\nSo, I'd like to build MultiIndex support for legacy connections.\n"
