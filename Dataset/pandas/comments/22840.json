If we were to include a tri argument, I would prefer a tri=None(default)/'upper'/'lower' instead of tri=True/False for just the lower triangular so users can have the option of the upper triangular.\r\n\r\n2. In your implementation, it appears fill value would be NaN as opposed to numpy (triu/trul) which the fill value is 0. I am not sure what the preferred fill value should be, but in general we try to stay consistent with numpy conventions."
