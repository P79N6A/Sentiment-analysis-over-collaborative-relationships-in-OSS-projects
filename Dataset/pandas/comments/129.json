I just started really using git a week ago, so I think I have your thoroughly beat on that front.\n\nHappy to do this however you see best in the future...I'll try to follow something like the scikit.learn guidelines (http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/dev/developers/index.html).  You might want to post something like that on the pandas docs eventually if more people start to meddle?\n"
