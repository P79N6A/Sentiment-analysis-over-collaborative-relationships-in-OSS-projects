    "body": "this is a duplicate/related #5216. their are several issues that address various aspects of this.\nIn any event, this is fixed in 0.13.\n\nthe proper method of setting is\n\n`df.loc[~df.all(1),'c'] = 2` which works fine in 0.12\n\ndoing `df['c'][`df.all(1)]` is a chained assignment and can work at times, but is dependent on whether you have a mixed dtype frame or not and what exactly you are updating hence lways better to use ''.loc''\n\nsee [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/indexing.html#indexing-view-versus-copy) for a more detailed discussion\n"
