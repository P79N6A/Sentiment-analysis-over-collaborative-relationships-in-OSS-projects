    "body": "Series was refactored in 0.13.1, see here: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/whatsnew.html#whatsnew-0130-refactoring\n\nThis is a 'numpy' issue, I think 1.9 (or 1.10) addresses it. The work-around is as you suggest (or to wrap the numpy array as a Series).\n\nsee same issue in #6168 and #5776 \n\nthanks for the report\n"
