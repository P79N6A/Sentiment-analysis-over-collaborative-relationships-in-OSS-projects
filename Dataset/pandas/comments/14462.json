    "body": "FYI: I started working on combining the Feather and pyarrow codebases which will also bring new Feather features (e.g. reading and writing to Python file objects).\r\n\r\nAnother aside: I'm also planning eventually to develop a native C++ JSON table parser using RapidJSON within the Arrow codebase. Schema inference is the most annoying part, but I would want this `arrow_json` component to pass the pandas JSON test suite. Eventually we can support schemas with unions (where some fields might contain multiple types). pandas 2.0 can acquire union types, too"
