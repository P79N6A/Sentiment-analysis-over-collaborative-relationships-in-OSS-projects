    "body": "This looks really nice!\n\nI'm going to piggy-back on this to bring up another Exception-related item (though it's about `Exception` rather than `AssertionError`) ... it's not great to raise `Exception` everywhere, because it makes it harder to check for exceptions, consider the following:\n\n``` python\ntry:\n    df2 = pandas.ga() # some web scrape or other\n    df.inde == df2.index\nexcept Exception:\n    #whelp, does this mean the scrape failed here?\n```\n\nWhereas, if we tried to default to more descriptive Exceptions where appropriate and/or used the `PandasError` in core, that would make it less ambiguous.  E.g., in `io/data`, I'd assert that nearly every use of `Exception` could either be a `PandasError` or something like:\n\n``` python\nclass DataError(IOError, PandasError): pass\n```\n\nThat way you could be more specific about what you want to catch (and eventually rewrite some of the test cases to cover this as well) + it's backwards-compatible, because checks for `Exception` will still pick this up.\n\nIs this worth pursuing? (I'm volunteering to do this.)\n"
