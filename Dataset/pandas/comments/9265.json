    "body": "you can directly implement `clip` I believe. I eg. you apply the clipper to the actual non-missing values, the return a new structure. This will be efficient. This is simply inheriting existing behavior (which is not correct).\n\nSo would love for:\n- implement this soln\n- mark methods which don't 'work' as `NotImplemented` (e.g. have tests for these systematically). If you'd like to attempt this, create another issue for this (and can put up a list)\n"
