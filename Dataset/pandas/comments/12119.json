    "body": "That proposal also copies an existing list, which would have some performance impact where `tuples` were already a list.\n\nYou could have a function that checks if something in an iterator (or isn't a `Sized`), and coerces it to a list if an iterator. \nYou could also try and delay checking the `len` until later, after the iterator would have been iterated, and see if users would get reasonable error messages where there is a break.\n"
