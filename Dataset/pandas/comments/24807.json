    "body": "There are certainly some updates that can be made in the doc, so sure feel free to submit a PR. At the very least the references to `.values` could be replaced with `.to_numpy()`\r\n\r\nWith that said I'm not sure the benchmark you've provided is all that relevant. Cython looping will definitely be much faster than iteration in Python. IIUC your benchmark is only on a very small DataFrame (1,000 records) so differences may not be as apparent there but certainly on larger datasets Cython performance will be much better"
