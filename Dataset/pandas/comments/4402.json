    "body": "you should do\n\n``` python\ns.plot(style='--', color='k')\n```\n\n`matplotlib` will just show you an empty plot with `plot(s, linestyle='k--')` and pandas will throw an error (more useful IMO)\n\nthere's no need to have `style` accept a string with a color name in it since as you show there's a `color` param to do that\n\nfor some reason MATLAB thought it was a good idea to couple line style and color :expressionless:\n\nthis should report a better error tho for sure\n"
