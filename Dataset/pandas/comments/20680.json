    "body": "this is to prevent user error. Starting with an empty frame rarely makes sense (and is non-performant to add rows like this). The issue is that if you are assigning to a row a non-labeled list-like (e.g. a list or np.array, not a Series), then it is ambiguous to what you are actually trying to do, meaning are you wanting to create *columns* or assign to a single new column. So this must be explicit by the user."
