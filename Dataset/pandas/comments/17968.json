    "body": "The idea, including the possibility of overriding (although this would require changing signatures), is intriguing.\r\n\r\nNotice however that the meaning of ``inplace=`` does not strictly map to memory usage, but rather to programming style. Take for instance ``reset_index()``: even with ``inplace=True`` it can copy _data_ in memory - but the _object_ will be the same.\r\n\r\nWhen available (that is, when it makes sense and it is not a nightmare to implement - see e.g. ``reindex()``), ``copy=`` corresponds more to what you have in mind."

    "body": "so ``inplace=`` doesn't actually do anything, except copy internally then perform the operation and replace the original object reference. There is NO performance gain / memory gain at all (except maybe in 1 instance). So this is a completely useless option anyhow, should deprecate this: see https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/16529\r\n\r\nso -1 on this idea."
