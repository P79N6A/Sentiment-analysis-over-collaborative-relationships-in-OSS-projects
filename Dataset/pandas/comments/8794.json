    "body": "Several things:\n- I don't like `normalize` as the name of this method because it collides conceptually with the pytz method of the same name.  The rails name for this is `midnight`; maybe that would be better?\n- Temporarily setting `tzinfo=None` in the middle of an operation that takes an aware `Timestamp` and returns an aware `Timestamp` makes me very uneasy.  I think we should make it so that aware `Timestamp`s behave in a way that makes this rarely necessary.\n- In this case, stripping the `tzinfo` results in `AmbiguousTimeError`s in jurisdictions where DST changes from 1:00 to 0:00.  (Try `pd.Timestamp('2013-11-03 00:00:00-0400', tz='America/Havana')`.)  However, this is one of the few cases where it makes sense to do it this way because we almost certainly want the _first_ occurrence of midnight in such a case.\n"

This method of stripping `tzinfo`, replacing, and relocalizing is also used in the `DateOffset` code as `relativedelta` uses `replace` as well.  Fixing `replace` would alleviate the need for this method, but I'm not sure how people feel about that.  Also, it's not immediately clear that something similar would not need to be done in that case.\n"

    "body": "I really, _really_ wanted to be able to just say, \"The `ambiguous` kwarg is reserved for converting naive time representations into aware time representations, and everywhere else things should Just Work.\"  But this isn't going to happen, because many of the operations that we want to do on local times _are_ ambiguous.  So `Timestamp.replace` should ask what to do in an ambiguous case.  `Timestamp.normalize` (looking at how many times `normalize` appears in the code, I think I have to give up on renaming it to `midnight`), however, should call (or be equivalent to calling) `Timestamp.replace(ambiguous=True)`, so that the first instance of midnight is chosen.\n\nGiven that some operations on aware time representations do have to ask how to resolve ambiguities, I'm inclined to split point 2:\n- The user should be able to ignore that ubiquitous piece of advice, \"store everything in UTC and convert from/to local time only for I/O\" and have everything still Just Work, as long as no operations that explicitly care about the local representation of the time are applied.\n- The _user_ should never have to convert between aware and naive time representations except at I/O boundaries.\n- Maybe the library should pass _all_ handling of ambiguity through a single bottleneck, probably in `tz_localize`?  This would mean that _every_ operation which needs to deal with ambiguity operates by converting to a naive time, operating, and then relocalizing.  \n\n@jorisvandenbossche Try your example with this:\n\n```\nt = pd.Timestamp('2013-11-03 06:00:00', tz='America/Havana')\n```\n"
