This is an interesting suggestion, but it would be a huge change admittedly, since we would have to propagate this across the entire codebase.\r\n\r\nFWIW, it seems like `numpy` accepts boolean and integer (though not just 0 and 1) inputs for its boolean flags, for better or worse.\r\n\r\n@jreback @jorisvandenbossche : Thoughts?"
