    "body": "Yeah, I figured that this was non-trivial. I suppose the easiest fix would be to just update the documentation so that it explicitly states that `.apply` must return a vector of the same length as the input. A slightly less trivial fix could be to apply `.apply` to the  first column and use the resulting size to initalize the new dataframe. But I'm not sure if this works with the underlying logic, nor am I certain how much overhead that might add to the function."
