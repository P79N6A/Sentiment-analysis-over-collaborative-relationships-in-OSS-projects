    "body": "@locojay, agreed that as much as possible should be recreated on read: names, labels, index structure.\n\nRather then relying on style information, I suggest using the following convention, which should\nallow automagically inferring what information is present in the file:\n\n```\nExample 1\n|   | x |   | x | x |\n|   | x |   | x | x |\n| x | x |   | x | x |\n|   |   |   |   |   |\n| x | x |   | x | x |\n| x | x |   | x | x |\n| x | x |   | x | x |\n\nExample 2\n|   |   |   | x | x |\n|   |   |   | x | x |\n| x | x |   | x | x |\n|   |   |   |   |   |\n| x | x |   | x | x |\n| x | x |   | x | x |\n| x | x |   | x | x |\n\nExample 3\n|   |   |   | x | x |\n|   |   |   |   |   |\n| x | x |   | x | x |\n| x | x |   | x | x |\n| x | x |   | x | x |\n\nExample 4\n| x |   | x | x |\n|   |   |   |   |\n| x |   | x | x |\n| x |   | x | x |\n| x |   | x | x |\n\nExample 7\n| x |   | x | x |\n| x |   | x | x |\n| x |   | x | x |\n\nExample 8\n| x | x |\n|   |   |\n| x | x |\n| x | x |\n| x | x |\n\nExample 9\n| x |   |   |   |\n|   |   |   |   |\n| x |   | x | x |\n| x |   | x | x |\n| x |   | x | x |\n\nExample 10\n| x |   | x | x |\n|   |   |   |   |\n|   |   | x | x |\n|   |   | x | x |\n|   |   | x | x |\n\nExample 11\n| x | x | x |\n| x | x | x |\n| x | x | x |\n\nexample 12\n| x | x |\n\nexample 13\n| x |\n| x |\n\nexample 14\n| x |\n| x |\n\n\n```\n\nIf this works, you (the parser) should be able to figure out the right thing to do in all cases, can you?\n9/10 are pretty ugly and maybe we should just drop the name in that case\n12/13/14 are ambiguous and so we need to decide on sane defaults.\n\nThis is pretty close to what you've already done, and also uses @changhiskhan 's idea of \nsniffing things out. Most of the work would be in the parser like you mentioned.\n\nonce the parse can handle all parts being present/missing, it's fine to add\nargs to control [row,col]-index on/off, names on off.\n\nShould integer (\"default\") indexes be dumped to the file? no? optional?\n\nI would like merged cells to be optional (default on is fine by me), in case \nthey expose some unforseen issues in people's excel workflows (exporting to csv, VBA, etc').\n\nThere's a lot of work in making this work consistently.... diminishing returns?\n"
