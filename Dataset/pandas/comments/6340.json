    "body": "I actually have no idea. We are now testing with 0.8.1 and 0.9. I quickly looked at their migration guide to 0.8.1 and didn't see anything obvious we would need.\n\nThey still support both series 0.8 and 0.9 (current releases are 0.8.6 and 0.9.4). And 0.8.1 was released April 27, 2013, so indeed rather recent. \n\n0.7.1 was released Jun 05 2011. So I would just try it and see if the tests pass?\n"
