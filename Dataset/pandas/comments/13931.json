So sure could be some more hints here (maybe even `dayfirst`, `yearfirst` would be enough), as we don't support passing `format` to `Timestamp`. \n\nThis all comes at a cost though. perf has to be monitored (e.g. to take the fast path when this kind of parsing is NOT needed). Further improved docs / examples are always welcome.\n\nPR to start us off?\n"
