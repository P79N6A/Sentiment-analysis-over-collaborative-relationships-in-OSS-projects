    "body": "@WillAyd \r\nIf I understand your proposal, I don't think it's easier for a couple of reasons. Firstly these docstrings inherited from the datetime library are not in the pandas library as a string, at least I can't grep them.\r\nMore importantly, editting them to adhere to GL01 and GL02 may seem trivial but editting them to adhere to the rest of the list of errors is not trivial and just strange. If we intend to eventually have the entire list of errors on `validate_docstrings.py` to be checked by the CI then it makes sense to be able to exempt inherited docstrings. For example, RT01 tests for a returns section in the docstring and then there are more tests about the returns section. (Introspection to check whether the docstring is inherited is another option that was considered but decided to be overkill).\r\nThis way presents its own problems, like having docstrings that are not very helpful and having to make sure not to add a docstring to the whitelist by mistake. Still, unless there is something I'm unaware of, it is a good way forward to get more docstring errors to be checked by CI.\r\n\r\n"
