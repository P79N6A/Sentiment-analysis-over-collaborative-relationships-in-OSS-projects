    "body": "As you mentioned in the linked comment, `_ndarray_values` is already overloaded; my point is that `_data` is equally overloaded.  Three options come to mind:\r\n\r\n1) Accept that we are not likely to find a good name for an attribute to set in `__init__` that works for all our EA subclasses.  Instead, try to use informative names on a case-by-case basis.  One upside to this is it avoids creating \"shadow interface\" where we get used to EA classes having certain behavior despite not actually requiring it.\r\n\r\n2) Standardize on a name like `_initvals` or `_attrvals` that conveys no information other than \"this is set in `__init__` and is a plain attribute-lookup\".  This has the advantage of being very clear.  (Also relevant: there has also been discussion elsewhere of wanting a name that guarantees fast/no-copy access.)\r\n\r\n3) This PR doesn't try to change the name set in `__init__`, so that part of the issue could be kicked down the road.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR _does_ do is replace usages of a highly-overloaded name with usages of an entirely-clear name.  If later we need to tinker with it in order to share code with other Datetimelike EAs, I'm fine with that."
