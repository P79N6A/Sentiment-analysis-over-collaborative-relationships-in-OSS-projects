    "body": "@pandas-dev/pandas-core \r\n\r\nas we briefly discussed before, we need to be pretty circumspect about merging even to master changes that are not backportable to 0.24.x, prob for a little while. Small changes ok, but sweeping reorgs just make backporting much more difficult (as may need to go thru potentially a lot of effort to backport). So am going to suggest that we hold off on 'bigger' things until 0.24.1 is out.\r\n\r\n- this means don't remove any PY2 removal stuff quite yet.\r\n- we may need to keep merging master on soon to be merged PRs, so the backlog may grow.\r\n- bug fixes, by all means, sometimes this may mean narrowing the scope of a bug fix though (meaning that if the 'right' way to do it involves a fairly big reorg).\r\n"

    "body": "I think one of the key points is still to decide on a policy for dealing with breaking changes, both for 0.25/1.0 and after.\r\n\r\nThere's still a bunch of inconsistencies that we'd be locking in for 1.0, and even more so if we'd be doing *actual* SemVer afterwards - changing a `None` to a `np.nan` somewhere would then already count as breaking).\r\n* groupby: #22545 (+ #20420, #22541, #22542, #22546, ...)\r\n* consistent IO-API: #15862, #21640, maybe #15841\r\n* boolean Series: #22724, #6528, #13806\r\n\r\nThis list is obviously not exhaustive. Pandas is certainly very mature by now, but IMO not consistent enough to do SemVer (otherwise every release would be major).\r\n\r\nMaybe numpy-style rolling deprecations (as we've been doing as well) would be less restrictive to actually fixing some of these issues (it's worth noting that on the numpy side, it will still take monumental determination and effort to actually fix some very longstanding issues for an [eventual 2.0](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/Backwards-incompatible-ideas-for-a-major-release))\r\n\r\nThere's much smaller fish I'd like to fry as well, but all of which are breaking in some way.\r\n* inferring types for `.str`-accessor; moving bytes to separate accessor; #23011 #23167+ several fixes that are blocked on that refactor\r\n* fixing `maybe_promote` and `maybe_upcast_putmask` #23823 #23833 to then fix `.update` etc. #23606\r\n* adding the long-open inverses to unique #4087, #22824, #21357, which needs that `Series.unique` stays a Series (which would also fit very well with the current drive from 0.24 that one needs `.to_numpy()` to get an ndarray)\r\n\r\nTL;DR: most bigger PRs are breaking from the point of SemVer. A policy of *zero* breaking changes until 1.0 will probably mean little development."
