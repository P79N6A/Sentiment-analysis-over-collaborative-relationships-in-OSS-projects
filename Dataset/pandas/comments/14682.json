    "body": "I've been trying to debug the above issue. \n\nTried adding the ambiguous keyword to the constructor of the Timestamps... but I wasn't sure how to set it (as `infer`) didn't seem to be a valid option.\n\nThe code raising the exception seems to have been modified with commit dcc68d7c5a06df85fe9fec568566bee1e9936b10 where the `_adjust_dates_anchored()` function at `pandas.tseries.resample` module first drops the tz information at the beginning of the function and then adds it back on the return statement.\n\nI've modified the code to not do that... but then I had to modify an assert at pandas.tseries.index.py that it is checking for equality of time zones... but it turns that Europe/Madrid on DST is considered different from Europe/Madrid not on DST.\n\nI'll try to create a pull request with my changes so that you can comment.\n"
