If you are trying to write multiple sheets to excel you should follow the instructions in the `to_excel` documentation:\r\n\r\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_excel.html#pandas-dataframe-to-excel\r\n\r\nClosing for now but if the above doesn't work and you can isolate to a minimal example feel free to reopen"
