    "body": "Also, as a general thought or question, my intention for doing the above was this (and perhaps you can suggest a better way of getting there): I have a dataset with two columns used for identification of results (say a \"place\" and a \"time\"), one column with booleans for success/failure, plus some more columns. I'm trying to extract data for all \"time\" and \"place\" combinations that have at least one recorded successful result. My steps so far look like this:\n\n```\ngroups = df[df['success'] == True].groupby(['time', 'place'])['success'].agg(len)\n```\n\nNow i would take the index from 'groups' and reindex the original data with it to get the result i want (this is where the above crash occurs, at least with the data in the example). But for that result, the last two steps (column selection and the '.add' call) are not necessary, i just want the index. Is the index already assembled after \".groupby()\", so that it could be used without running the aggregation first? Or is there any other process that is preferable for this task?\n"
