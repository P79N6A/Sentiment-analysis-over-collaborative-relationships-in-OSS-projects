    "body": "> I don't like the idea of disallowing on PI but not the others.\r\n\r\nI think this difference is acceptable, because `freq` also has a different notion for both: for PI the `freq` is required (you cannot have a PI without a `freq`), and the underlying int values are dependent on this freq. So changing the `freq` is either buggy because the values and the freq no longer match (current behaviour), or it converts the underlying int values to match the new `freq` (but this is what `asfreq` already does, and since this alters the data, I think should not be done by setting an attribute). \r\nOn the other hand, for DTI and TDI, the `freq` is not required, and setting it allows you to add one. But this only changes the `freq` to the `inferred_freq` and does not alter the data (as otherwise an error is raised)."

    "body": "> Is there a compelling use-case to actually set freq (whether inplace or return a new object) on a DTI/TDI?\r\n\r\nI made this PR after noticing a few SO questions that worked around the buggy setting behavior.  That doesn't necessarily there's actually a _valid_ use case for it, as there may be more direct workarounds for the issues people are having, but at the very least people are trying to use it.\r\n\r\nI think one of the issues is that people generally default to using `pd.to_datetime` for parsing, which as far as I can tell does not have the ability to set a frequency on creation, and so they then want to set a frequency after creation.  This might be more of an argument for a `freq` parameter in `pd.to_datetime` though.  There also isn't much documentation for the `freq='infer'` option of the DTI constructor, so I also see people wanting to set the inferred frequency after creation, without actually knowing what that frequency is (again, more of a documentation issue).\r\n\r\nI could also imagine a use case where one has messy data which needs to be cleaned first, prior to actually setting the `freq`.  So a workflow like parse -> clean -> set frequency.  Some cleaning operations may take care of the setting the `freq`, but there are cases where multiple frequencies are possible, so the correct one may not be set, or a custom frequency may be desired, or maybe no frequency is desired and a user wants to remove by setting `None`.\r\n\r\n\r\n>Whether .asfreq happens to do work on a PI, and doesn't on a TDI/DTI is not a compelling argument.\r\n\r\nTo add another data point, `Series.asfreq` and `DataFrame.asfreq` will also do work on an underlying DTI (doesn't appear to work for TDI).\r\n\r\nNot particularly invested in being for/against reusing the `asfreq` name though, as there are downsides to both without a clear winner in my mind (potential for confusion with reuse vs. API bloat for new method)."

    "body": "> On an immutable object this is True. We have 1 and only 1 attribute that we allow to be changed on an Index and that is the name. All others give you back a new object. Why break this paradigm?\r\n\r\nExactly because the `freq` does *not change* the index, so the index is still immutable, except for those informative attributes like `name` and `freq`. So that in sense, `freq` is very similar to `name` for a DTI/TDI.\r\n\r\n> To add another data point, Series.asfreq and DataFrame.asfreq will also do work on an underlying DTI (doesn't appear to work for TDI).\r\n\r\nFor me that is another reason not to use `asfreq`, as for Series this is indeed a basic form of resample. So the name `asfreq` is already too much overloaded, no need to add yet another meaning."
