    "body": "see the logic here: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/_libs/tslib.pyx#L400\r\n\r\nfor integers of ``unit='ns'`` we take a fast path essentially by astyping. However we don't special cases ints/floats of non-ns. We iterate over the list (in cython), but this is not necessary when its a uniform dtypes (this is necessary for strings and mixed dtypes).\r\n\r\nso this is conceptually very easy to fix, but would have to slightly re-factor ``cast_from_unit`` into 2 parts: 1) that returns m, p (the rouding and multiplers and 2) use those to replace the existing function.\r\n\r\nThe reason is you need part 1) to do the calculation.\r\n\r\nThis is all very straightforward, but care must be taken to make sure ``cast_from_unit`` is still performant."
