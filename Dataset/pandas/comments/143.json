    "body": "Oh I see. It works for me now. Thanks.\n\nThe default behavior may be somewhat misleading if the saved file is viewed as text or opened with excel, especially when there are many columns. I think that people consider csv file a table format, as such headers should be aligned with columns. Is it better to have the default output ',a,b' instead of 'a,b'?\n\nIn any case this is a minor point. It's perfectly fine the way it is. BTW great work on pandas -- it has become a indispensable tool for me.\n"
