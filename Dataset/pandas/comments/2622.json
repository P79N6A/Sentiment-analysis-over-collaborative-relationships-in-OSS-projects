Is the idea just to fold this project into pandas? If it's just to also return country-year panels, wouldn't this best be an issue for wbdata? It shouldn't be more than a few lines of code right?\n\nFYI, another project I'm aware of is [pyWDI](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/pyWDI), though I haven't done any comparison of API, functionality, etc.\n\nAny ideas?\n\ncc @vincentarelbundock @oliversherouse\n"
