    "body": "I'm closing this issue because the documentation doesn't strongly support using `conda` for Windows as I thought it might have, at least based on <a href=\"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/837db725b147104be4b0e5cbfd49868971ee4f78/doc/source/install.rst\">here</a>.  At the very least, I can say that `Cygwin` should work, `mingw-w64` is uncertain at the time of writing."
