I have to set `convert_categoricals=False` because there is a fundamental mismatch between pandas categoricals and Stata's value labels (pandas requires unique category names and Stata does not).\r\n\r\nI think that raising an `AttributeError` is inappropriate in this situation. It's being raised incidentally because `_read_value_labels` is not behaving in a way that `value_labels` is expecting, rather than to signal what is really going on (that the stata file being read doesn't have value labels because the format doesn't support it).\r\n\r\nIt's also inconsistent. Within `.read()` there's [an explicit check of the file format version to prevent this AttributeError](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/io/stata.py#L1593) but for whatever reason this check is not present in `value_labels()`"
