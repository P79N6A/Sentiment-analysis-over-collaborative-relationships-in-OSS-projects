It will be a lot easier to merge a fix for this with only one (hopefully) tokenizing function to work with.\n\nI also realized that an issue with my current fix is that we will be penalizing people if the fields in the skipped row are malformed (since we are parsing them as if they were rows to be included), which is not what we want IINM.  Thus, I might need to go back to the drawing board (even if the correctness > the performance as the PR currently stands) to see whether I can build in such safety mechanisms or go back to my other strategy of introducing some additional states for skipped rows.\n"
