When I made the necessary changes, I noticed that all of the tests still passed when they shouldn't have. I read the docs again to see if I missed anything, and asked on IRC, but we couldn't come up with a solution. Is there something I need to be doing with nosetests in order to run a similar test suite to the one on Travis?\n\nThanks,\nMandeep\n"
