Yea I understand it's hard to track all the getattrs/getitems unless you maintain some sort of a call/index stack but that's sure an overkill to just fire warnings.\n\nI think it was discussed in another issue, so that stuff like `df[df.a > 1]['a'].iloc[0] = 'b'` gives a warning (and it does), and stuff like `df.a.iloc[0] = 'b'` doesn't on purpose since it's \"safe\"?
