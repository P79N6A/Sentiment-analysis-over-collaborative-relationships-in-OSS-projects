    "body": "As noted in the commit message, this brings a measurable but only modest gain to the \"not slow\" test suite, 10-15% on my machine.  It also beefs up the test for assert_almost_equal(), which did unearth a couple of edge cases which I fixed.\n\nWhile the entire test suite doesn't improve that much, this does significantly speed up assert_almost_equal().  The main performance gain comes from replacing np.testing.assert_almost_equal(float_value1, float_value2, decimal=decimal) into the simplified very fast C cython function.  As noted in the commit message, a test like test_expressions.py which heavily uses this function runs over 3x faster with the cython version.\n\nThere are other ways to squeak out more performance (moving isnull(obj) into cython for example), but given that assert_almost_equal() isnt' that much of a bottleneck I err-ed on the side of maintaining readability instead of converting everything into cython. \n"

    "body": "I'm glad you're starting on this (and that you've fixed weird cases in assert_almost_equal) - I have a few points I'd like to consider for this:\n1. It's incredibly important to actually _print_ what's wrong (i.e., isnull should show repr of other, etc.) and with asserts, part after the comma isn't executed unless the assert fails so it's not a big deal.\n2. My preference is not to merge this until 0.13, but I'm okay either way.\n3. Is your check for `int` and friends sufficient? I thought some numpy types (like maybe smaller ints) were separate (i.e., np.integer_, np.floating, np.complexfloating) - test suite passes so I'm probably wrong.\n\nFinally, could we change all the uses of np's assert_equal in the test suite to use this instead?\n"

    "body": "1) Good point, I'll update all the messages\n\n2) My preference is to commit it as soon as possible, because a) I want to keep exploring speeding up the tests which I imagine is going to including cython-ing more common test functions and b) It is a pain to keep a rewrite like this in sync with the main branch since merging won't work.\n\n3) I actually started down this path a little bit (as you can see with the minor change I made), but then stopped because the less I change the easier it is to evaluate this change as a simple python --> cython change that isn't going to break anything.  The current code does need to be improved, it fails to cases like this:\n\n```\nassert_almost_equal(2.00000001, np.int32(2))  # fine\nassert_almost_equal(np.int32(2), 2.00000001)  # error\n```\n\nMy plan was to fix this in a separate change, but I can fix it here.  My main reason for keeping it simple was for the sake of the reviewer and my general development philosophy (described below).\n\n4) No problem updating all of `assert_equal`s, but I think that should be in a follow-up change.\n\nThis may come down to a development philosophy issue (where I am happy to align my style to the project), but my preferred way of development is making changes as small as possible, then getting them merged as quickly as possible and then continuing to iterate in that way to add complexity.  So for an example like this, instead of going from \"python function --> fixed and updated cython function\", I prefer \"python function --> cython function --> fixed and updated cython function\", with a commit and merge at each step of the way.  I find this is easier for other people's readability of the changes and makes it easier to locate where bugs were added (IE did I add the bug when going from python --> cython or did I add the bug trying to update the function?).\n\nHowever, the overhead of reviewing the changes falls with you guys, so in that way I am happy to develop in whatever way you prefer.\n"

I've been on the other side and it is a heck of a pain to maintain (though I've also been responsible for some huge PRs recently).\n\nThat said, we need to fix the type checks and effective failure messages before this can be merged.  How about you have one commit that moves to Cython, then add a second commit that fixes type checks and other elements like that (so we can see changes you've made on top of the Cython code)?\n\nAlso, there have been a number of bugs in the error messages in this module, mostly stemming from the fact that the argument names are `a` and `b` rather than `actual`, `expected`. After this PR, we should fix that.\n"

    "body": "Added release notes into first commit.\n\nAlso I spent a few hours playing with test performance yesterday and I didn't really find any other places where it seems you could get a huge performance gain just by refactoring stuff (other than this change).  I did find a couple areas where you could shave off a few percent in the test speed (mostly by making test cases smaller and other assorted minor performance tweaks), but I didn't see any other low hanging fruit.  It seems the tests take a while to run because there are a lot of them and because matplotlib is slow, neither of which is really solvable.\n"

    "body": "Works for me.  This change is pretty independent from that one, in that the two main things assert_almost_equal does are provide useful error messages about why 2 things are not equal and compare floats while allowing some small margin of difference.\n\nIf there is a function which is better at determining if two arrays are exactly equal quickly (like np.array_equal or array_equivalent), that is a useful optimization for this function, but it doesn't actually replace any of the functionality here.\n"
