    "body": "I'm not familiar with this part of the code base, but it looks like placing the index_label in the second row was intentional, probably to mimic the output in the terminal.\n\nThe problem here seems to be that if `df.index` has a name, there's no way to not have an index_label in the excel output (short of modifying `df.index` before writing).\n\nFrom the docstring:\n\n```\n        index_label : string or sequence, default None\n            Column label for index column(s) if desired. If None is given, and\n            `header` and `index` are True, then the index names are used. A\n            sequence should be given if the DataFrame uses MultiIndex.\n```\n\nCould we keep the current behavior of `index_label=None` defaulting to the index name when `header` and `index` are True, but look for `index_label=False`. if `index_label=False` then don't include and index label. Would treating `False` and `None` differently break too many rules?\n"

I understand what you have quoted from the docstring and it makes sense that it would write the label even if `index_label=None`.\n\nIf it is intentional that the index_label is written in the 2nd row, then I would consider that a regression. I would say that more important than mimicking the output in the terminal, is to keep consistency. Here are two reasons:\n1. As shown in the first message, it is not possible to read the file in the same manner as it was written;\n2. When reading a file for instance with `df = pd.DataFrame.from_csv(filepath)`, if the first cell, in the first row, has the value LABEL, then you will have `df.index.name` equal to LABEL.\n"

I am responsible for this change (not locojay). It was implemented as part of #5254 (ENH: Better handling of MultiIndex with Excel).\n2. This is the intended behaviour. It is meant to mimic the repl output. Whether that is right or wrong I can't say but it went through a lot of code reviewing at the time with screenshots so someone should have shouted before now. :-) \n3. You can get the previous (0.12) behaviour by setting the `merge_cells` option in `to_excel()`:\n   \n   ```\n   df.to_excel('test.xlsx', index_label='test', merge_cells=False)\n   ```\n4. The 0.13 output file can be re-read correctly using the `has_index_names` option:\n   \n   ```\n    >>> pd.read_excel('test.xlsx', 0, has_index_names=True)\n          a  b  c\n    test\n    0     1  2  3\n    1     4  5  6\n   ```\n"
