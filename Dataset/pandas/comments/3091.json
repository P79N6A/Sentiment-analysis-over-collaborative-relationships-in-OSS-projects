    "body": "Thanks for the quick replies!\nI looked at it. Indeed is should be a problem with my installation; at my home laptop, I wouldn't get the same problems, but had slightly different versions of the packages. It makes sense that I would at some point run into this kind of problem as I am not much of a expert and had to install many different packages for using GIS with Python x,y. And surely I have a ArcGIS Python 2.6 install somewhere, causing even other troubles. Reinstalling everything is not an option for now, I am sorry... and I promise I will learn more about how to set path and environment settings because it seems I could solve my problems there?\n\nJust for the record: my Pytables and GDAL were installed with the Python x,y distribution; not too sure whether on install of the whole system or as plugins later on. I use the latest pandas stable release, installed from their download site. I have a separate osgeo system installed using OSgeo4W (http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/). \n\nMy attempts to solve the issue with reinstalling the Python x,y GDAL and PyTables plugins were without success. The 3 lines of code provided at http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/issues/detail?id=346 (2nd post of jreback) also solved the issue and I consider using it to keep all running. \n\nimport os\nfrom distutils.sysconfig import get_python_lib\nos.environ['PATH']=get_python_lib()+';'+os.environ['PATH']\n\nHowever, I will try to look into mending my PATH settings a bit more properly (Google finds a lot of tutorial so I'll look at that). \n\nI am sorry to have bothered the pandas forum with my installation spaghetti. Thumbs up for helping me further nonetheless!\n"
