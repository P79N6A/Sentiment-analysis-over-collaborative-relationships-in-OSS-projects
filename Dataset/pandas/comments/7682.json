The order of precedence for authentication credentials is:\n\nCredentials passed into the Connection class constructor.\nCredentials specified by environment variables\nCredentials specified as named profiles in the shared credential file.\nCredentials specified by default in the shared credential file.\nCredentials specified as named profiles in the config file.\nCredentials specified by default in the config file.\n```\n\n[Source](http://boto.readthedocs.org/en/latest/boto_config_tut.html) \n\nAnyways, behavior could be that if a couple variable names are set (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY`) it would use those keys instead of the default environment variables. Thoughts? \n"
