    "body": "@timmie, thanks for the fast response!\n0.10 is going to be next release (fingers crossed we don't have to do a 0.92), which will probably be out maybe mid-late December?\n\ngenerally you can run the tests by doing something like `python pandas/tseries/tests/test_util.py` from the root pandas directory. And you can run the entire test suite using `test_fast.sh` (excludes plotting tests) or `test.sh`.\nYou need nosetests and coverage installed.\n\nWhen you run it in IPython your environment already has a bunch of stuff in it so that's probably why there's a discrepancy. The tests have to pass from clean slate.\n\nAfter you get the unit tests to pass, if you really want to make the code clean and nice, try to merge the methods in pivot and util. Your method should be called by the method in `util.pivot_annual` (i.e., I would add a check in the cascading ifs in util.pivot_annual to handle hourly frequency and call your function).\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions. As always, we're grateful for your contributions!\n"
