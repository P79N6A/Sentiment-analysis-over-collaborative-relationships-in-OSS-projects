    "body": "@mroeschke thinking further on this: there are 4 special cases to deal with when localizing  a range of tz-naive datetimes as in this TC, assuming there's just one DST transition in the range. \r\n\r\n1. STD>DST transition, non-tzlocal() case\r\n2. STD>DST transition, tzlocal() case\r\n3. DST>STD transition, non-tzlocal() case\r\n4. DST>STD transition, tzlocal() case\r\n\r\n1 and 2 may have non-existent times (valid as neither STD nor DST)\r\n3 and 4 may have ambiguous times (valid as both)\r\n\r\nFor example for Europe/London (GMT / BST) in 2014:\r\n- times from 01:00 to just before 02:00 on 30-mar don't exist in either time\r\n- times from 01:00 until 02:00 on 26-oct exist in both times\r\n\r\n`tz_localize()` seems to handle these 2 cases differently for `tzlocal()` and other timezones, even if they have the same DST transition points. For example on my system (with default values of the `tz_localize()` params `ambiguous` and `nonexistent`):\r\n\r\n1. raise `NonExistentTimeError`\r\n2. nonexistent times are moved back 1 hour and localized to STD time, producing duplicate times(!)\r\n3. raise `AmbiguousTimeError`\r\n4. ambiguous times are interpreted as DST, similar to `tz_localize(tz, ambiguous=False)`\r\n\r\nThe existing version of the testcase doesnt cover any of these special cases. Cases 1 and 2 because the combination of non-`tzlocal()` timezones in `tz_aware_fixture` and time intervals in the testcase dont include any DST transitions. Cases 3 and 4 because `tzlocal()` is UTC on travis.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to use the existing PR to extend `test_dti_tz_localize_roundtrip` to cover cases 1 and 3, but remove the `tzlocal()` case, and to submit a 2nd PR for the `tzlocal()` scenarios including cases 3 and 4  with a new testcase -- call it `test_dti_tz_localize_roundtrip_tzlocal`.\r\n\r\nThis 2nd PR would need some kind of mocking of `tzlocal()` as you suggested, in order to get adequate coverage and remove the dependence on the local tz. This could be tricky - i had a quick look at the `dateutil` code to see how they test `tzlocal()`, it looks like they havent mocked this either.\r\n\r\nif you're OK with this course of action, i'll have another go at it."

    "body": "Hmm so taking a step back, I think the main purpose of this test is to test this _basic_ behavior:\r\n\r\n1) Create a naive date range\r\n2) Attach a timezone to the date range\r\n3) Remove the time zone\r\n4) Assert the result is equal to the beginning\r\n\r\n```\r\nidx = date_range(...)\r\nlocalized = idx.tz_localize(tz)\r\nreset = localized.tz_localize(None)\r\ntm.assert_index_equal(reset, idx)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore when a DST transition exists, I would not expect this to roundtrip because attaching the timezone is problematic which you described (and is ok).\r\n\r\nSo while I appreciate the thought behind how to reorganize the test to catch these different cases, I suggest just simplifying this test all together by testing a date range where we're guaranteed not to have an ambiguous or nonexistent time (e.g. `date_range('2018-05-04 05:00:00', periods=3, freq='s')`, just guessing)."
