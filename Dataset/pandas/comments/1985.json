    "body": "Hello,\n\nI have the same issue. I created a PyTable using Pandas to store a Dataframe and a Panel. After closing the file, I reopen it using tables to store metadata in the file by creating a new node (named 'description') in the root. \n\nIf I want to read the pytable using HDFStore, I must specify the pandas object to retrieve (i.e., the name of the Dataframe or Panel that I stored) otherwise I get the following error:\n\nAttributeError: Attribute 'pandas_type' does not exist in node: '/description'\n\nI agree with enjoyaol. The HDF5 support is very nice with pandas, but we should be able to access more functionalities from PyTables. It would also be nice to add metadata to the pytables generated with Pandas, or directly to the Pandas Dataframes/Panels. For now I'm doing it manually, but it is not really an efficient way as we get an attribute error.\n\nRegards,\n\nGreg\n"
