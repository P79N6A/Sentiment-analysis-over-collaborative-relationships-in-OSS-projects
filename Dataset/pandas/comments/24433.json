Basically, if a parametrized test was defined directly on a fixture, I had to duplicate the parametrization in the subclass, which is no good.\r\n\r\nThat branch has started moving those parametrization to class attributes, e.g.\r\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/compare/master...TomAugspurger:astype-warning?expand=1#diff-9bd888be54b675f517a4ee682a58cbe9R88. If anyone has a cleaner alternative I'd be happy to hear it."
