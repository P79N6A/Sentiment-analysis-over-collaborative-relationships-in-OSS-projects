But it is extremely helpful to have in one overview what the rough ratio is between successful measurements with values and nans.\nIn my case, I have 3 different categories plus 'not categorized'. When displayed like so:\n\n```\n'a'   1000\n'b'   5000\n'c'   4000\n'nan' 100000\n```\n\nI immediately know that something went wrong, which I wouldn't suspect if I don't see the nans. When I have to do this without the nans, I first have to sum up all the real values and compare it to the length of series, it's always one more step to do. Sure, I can write my own wrapper, but I thought it's a useful feature to have it at least as an option to the value_counts call.\nWhat did you mean by `or for the mode`?\n"

I honestly cannot remember a case where I didn't want the missing values to be in the frequency counts.\n\nI've got to believe I'm nowhere near the only person who needs to see frequency counts for `nan` values.  I could see the lack of this feature slowing the adoption of pandas among SAS users.\n\nSAS does not report missing values in frequency reports by default, but I'm OK with always selecting that option when I run `PROC FREQ`. \n\nI do know how to add the missing counts to my `value_counts` output, but it's annoying to need to do it pretty much every time I use `value_counts`.  If I -- and probably others -- need to do this every time we use `value_counts` it seems like including `nan` counts in the results is a reasonable option to add to the method.\n"
