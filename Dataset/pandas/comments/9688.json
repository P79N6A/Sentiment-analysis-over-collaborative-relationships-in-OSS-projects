    "body": "That's been really fast!\n\nAfter a quick look at the code I was wondering if it also handels\n\"2014-S1\" for semesters. If \"T\" for trimersters is also in use, I don't\nknow. But semesters are. And pandas should parse them as well.\n\nSorry for not being able to read through the code more thoroughly. I\nhave been all too busy with my own pet project pandaSDMX wich will be\nreleased in a few days.\n\nThanks.\n\nLeo\n\nAm 26.03.2015 um 10:50 schrieb jreback:\n\n> Closed #9688 https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/9688 via #9701\n> https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/9701.\n> \n> â€”\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/9688#event-265653183.\n"
