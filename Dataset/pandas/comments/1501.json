It's going to cause some confusion for users, and I fear there will inevitably be PRs for pandas to enhance functionality for things like qqplot into areas we already cover. Ideally, I would think pandas would be used for visualization of data - not things that require estimation and inference - but, alas, it doesn't make sense to fight plots going into pandas and there's really not a clear cut line except that pandas can't have a reverse dependence on statsmodels.\n"
