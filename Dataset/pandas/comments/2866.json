    "body": "Since DataFrame is a 2-d structure, `data.ix[ : , 2 ]` is interpreting the `:` as the slice against the index and the `2` as an index against columns. Something like `data.ix['a', 2]` is a hack actually, technically the syntax is supposed to be 'data.ix[('a', 2)]' or 'data.ix[('a', 2), :]' but the code allows it similar to how 'arr.reshape(2,3,5)' should technically be 'arr.reshape((2,3,5))' according to the documented signature but works anyway.\n\n`data.ix[(:, 2), :]` isn't even valid Python syntax...`data.ix[(slice(None), 2), :]` is and technically could work but I guess it doesn't either. `data.set_index(data.index.droplevel(0)).ix[2,:]` works for now, though.\n"

    "body": "Just to be clear `df.ix[: , 2]` on a DataFrame works but it's treating the 2 as a column (which doesn't exist in this case), hence the error...`df.ix['a' , :]` is similar, it's not actually trying to slice the second level of the index with the `:`, it's slicing the columns, so calling `s.ix['a', :]` is not actually the equivalent operation.\n\nBasically from reading the code separate slicing by individual levels isn't really supported on MultiIndexes...I'm not really sure why `s.ix[ : , 2 ]` works but I guess it's a special case. So for the series you gave:\n\n``` python\nIn [377]: s.ix['a':'b', 1:2]\n(exception)\n\nIn [379]: s.ix['a':'b', 1]\n(exception)\n```\n\nI don't think it works because it would get too messy: it's conceptually easy in the case that all levels are sorted, unique, and have the same indices for each previous level index, but start relaxing those conditions and things get very complicated quickly.\n\nYou can slice like this, though:\n\n``` python\nIn [381]: s.ix[('a', 2):('b', 1)]\nOut[381]: \na  2    0.773469\n   3   -1.308689\nb  1   -1.431673\nDtype: float64\n```\n\n(although this is different semantics than what you want)\n"
