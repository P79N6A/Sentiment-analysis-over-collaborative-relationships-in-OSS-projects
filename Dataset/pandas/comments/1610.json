    "body": "Auto detection of the terminal width is a print option set by default. It can be disabled by setting max_columns to a non zero value. \n\n``` python\npandas.set_printoptions(max_columns=10)\n```\n\nIdea behind the auto detection is to determine if the full string representation of a series or dataframe fits in the terminal (either in width/height or both). If it does not fit a summary view will be displayed. Fit or not is independent if you run from interactive shell or not, so why ignore it?\n"

That should definitely not happen by default; when redirecting stdout to a file, the resulting contents of that file should not depend on current terminal dimensions. (That's true even for `ls` .)\n"
