There are a number of places where the internal arithmetic would have to change to handle the nano-second delta, some of which needs to be in the cython code.\nPlease take a look and let us know if it's something you'd have time to work on. A PR would be very welcome.\n"

Unfortunately getting a sub-second frequency string like freq='2800N' to work required some kind of rework of src/period.c which is still work in progress.\n\nYes, I would be glad to contribute to the project.\n\nRegards\nAndreas\n"
