    "body": "My first reaction was: and why not having the actual timedelta resolution? As we support this when doing `astype(\"m8[s])` starting from numerical data. \r\n\r\nBut, this is actually maybe a bug / also not consistent, as in theory we only support 'ns' resolution:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [4]: pd.Series([1,2,3]).astype('m8[s]')\r\nOut[4]: \r\n0   00:00:01\r\n1   00:00:02\r\n2   00:00:03\r\ndtype: timedelta64[s]    <---- kept the 's' resolution!\r\n```\r\n\r\nand for datetime it is interpreted correctly as well but then converted to ns:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [7]: pd.Series([1,2,3]).astype('M8[s]')\r\nOut[7]: \r\n0   1970-01-01 00:00:01\r\n1   1970-01-01 00:00:02\r\n2   1970-01-01 00:00:03\r\ndtype: datetime64[ns]    <---- it are seconds, but dtype resolution is 'ns'\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the actual issue, I have to think a bit further about it, but agree that the float result is very strange\r\n"
