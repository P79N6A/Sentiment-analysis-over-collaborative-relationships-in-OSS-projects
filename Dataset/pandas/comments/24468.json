But to be honest its actually a sensible default. Indexes are more and more important. If you are not using them you should.\r\n\r\nHowever, `.from_csv` has been deprecated in favor of `.read_csv`, which would only be the inverse of `.to_csv` if this default were changed.\r\n\r\nI can only interpret the other argument (similar to @chris-b1's reply) to be \"because legacy\". I personally consider this to be a poor argument in any case. Defaults have been changed before, is there a specific reason this one shouldn't?\r\n\r\n> Because it is schema-less, csv is never a particularly safe format for round-tripping, consider using something binary like parquet of HDF5 instead\r\n\r\nAgreed. However, while CSV may not be the best data format for round-tripping, in practice this is one of the most common use-cases. Many new users are confused as to why unnamed columns appear in their files seemingly at random. After years of using Pandas, I still regularly forget to set the right arguments to allow round-tripping. In my opinion, the inconsistency of the current defaults only adds unnecessary cognitive load.\r\n\r\nI think this is a good issue for v0.25."
