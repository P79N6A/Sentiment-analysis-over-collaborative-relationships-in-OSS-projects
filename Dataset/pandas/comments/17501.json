    "body": "@Giftlin : Thanks for submitting this!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I'm not sure if I agree with the decision to do this.  For starters, the current behavior is consistent with what you would see with Python's builtin `open` function, where directories are also not created if you try to create a non-existent file.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is consistent across our IO functions as alluded to by @programminggeek1-0 , meaning that this change *should* not occur on its own but rather in a series of PR's / commits to ensure that our IO interface is consistent.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, IMO, the responsibility of the file location rests on the user, and they should make sure that the file path they point to is reachable for `pandas`.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the future, for changes like this, it would be preferable that you open an issue first instead of a PR so that we can discuss this before changes are implemented."
