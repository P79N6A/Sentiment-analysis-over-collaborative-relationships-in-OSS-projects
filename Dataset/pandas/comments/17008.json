Sorting arraylike-elements within `Series` is an unusual use-case AFAIK, so I'm not sure whether we would find it worthwhile to implement such a vectorization ourselves **unless** we get more requests for such a feature OR we can identify a very strong (and more common) use-case for people.\r\n\r\n@jreback : your thoughts?"
