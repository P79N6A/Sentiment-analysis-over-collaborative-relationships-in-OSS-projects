    "body": "Yea I see where this is confusing but generally we don't support agg reducing to anything but a scalar, so I would think the first example returning something is pure coincidence and if anything the second example would be what we should be doing here.\r\n\r\nOthers may disagree though so let's see. FWIW apply is a more general function so you'd be safer to do something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf2.groupby(0)[1].apply(lambda x: list(x.mode()))\r\n```"

    "body": "As explained in the https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/19254 df2.groupby(0)[1].apply(lambda x: list(x.mode())) is really slow so it would be beneficial to add a separate groupby.mode() function implemented in the Cython. Such functionality is very often used for the categorical data so I am supprised that it still has not been implemented in Pandas.\r\n"
