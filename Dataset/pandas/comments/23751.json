    "body": "HI, @WillAyd, I just took another glimpse at the original issue and pandas doc for this, i guess what confused the people who raised the issue was the unclear doc, since `series.to_json` shares the doc with `df.to_json`, and following the doc, the output of `series.to_json` when `orient='records'` should be `[{column -> value}, â€¦ , {column -> value}]`, however the output of `series.to_json` is `[value, ..., value]`. And the same confusion could go to the `orient='index'`: `series.to_json(orient='index')`. For me the best approach to solve this issue would be separating doc strings for these instead of deprecating and rewriting existing functions. I would also suggest to close the issue code-wisely."
