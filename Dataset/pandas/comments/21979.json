    "body": "Not sure I entirely understand what you are looking for but you have quite a few options at your disposal. The best is probably to build a list of the values you want and construct the DataFrame from there at the very end instead of trying to insert values one by one\r\n\r\nThat said, this is more of a usage question so you'd be better off asking this on a Q&A site like StackOverflow. This issue tracker is used for bug reports and enhancement requests"
