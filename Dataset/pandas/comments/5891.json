    "body": "> I like to be able to tell Pandas to read the columns as strings. My current solution involves dropping down to xlrd to read the spreadsheet.\n\nHow exactly are you doing that?\n\nAs far as I can see from the `xlrd` code, when it reads a number from an xlsx file it immediately converts it to a `float` before returning the cell object to the user.\n\nSo unless I am missing something I don't see how Pandas can be made to read the columns as strings. It will always get a float from `xlrd` for an xls or xlsx file if Excel has stored them as numbers.\n\nThe CSV readers behave differently and can be type specified because they return all read data as strings regardless of whether it looks like a number of not.\n\nPerhaps @jreback  or @jtratner can suggest a different way to convert a column from `float64` to formatted strings.\n\nBut apart from a workaround I don't think this issue is fixable in the way that you would like.\n"

If all your numbers are ints, pandas will read them in as ints (recent change in 0.13) and you can just do `x.astype(str)` to get what you want, albeit not necessarily in a particularly fast way.  That said, if you're converting them to strings, they'll all be object dtype, so you're going to be using more memory and space.

Perhaps it would be possible to reformat the data prior to writing it to the CSV file. @jreback might have some suggestions there.\n"
