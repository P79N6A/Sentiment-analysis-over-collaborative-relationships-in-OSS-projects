    "body": "This is not a bug. If you want to use the cythonized groupby routines (e.g. sum), then these are summed as floats (because they can be converted). I suppose you _could_ check for an `object` dtyped 'float-like' (which is what `Decimal` is). but this seems to be code-cluttering to me.\n\nIf you would like to do a pull-request request to do something like this (and/or discuss) pls reopen/comment on this issue.\n"
