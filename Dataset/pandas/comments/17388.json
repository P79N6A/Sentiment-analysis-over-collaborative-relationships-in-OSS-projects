    "body": "> do not add moto to EVERY ci file, this completely defeats the purpose. only add where s3fs is atm. we specifically have certain types of tests marked as disabled. you need to handle moto NOT being installed (via a pytest.importorskip..). on windows only add on a single build, ok with adding the pip install but only add for the 3.6 build.\r\n\r\n@jreback what is the purpose I've defeated if I may ask? I suppose I can understand skipping some tests based on s3fs not being installed to test that pandas can handle import errors / can run without optional dependencies or something like that, but installing different _test_ dependencies per build is unnecessary and potentially dangerous. It also makes the build process needlessly complicated. I spent an extensive amount of time reading the build scripts and studying the failed build output to figure out which requirements files were being read in each build. I was finally frustrated enough that I just added it to every .pip file so at least all the environments would have that test-only dependency. Most of my time was spent waiting for the build since it took about 25 minutes or so to witness a failure.\r\n\r\nSkipping tests based on test-only dependencies can also be dangerous as you could implement a test that has a skip, and never realize the test would actually fail when it should have due to a bug the test would have otherwise found. 48 requirements files seems a bit excessive. Skipping based on test-only dependencies is a bad idea, IMHO."
