    "body": "@jreback, sorry for the delay, but I've added a second commit to this PR with:\n- added to release notes\n- `Series.quantile` on datetime[ns] series changed to return a `Timestamp` object (with an explicit test)\n- added a test for `Series.quantile` on timedelta64 series, which didn't require any\n  special handling, though the test is skipped at numpy 1.6.x, because\n  numpy.percentile throws the following exception with timedelta64 objects\n  pre-1.7:\n  \n  ```\n      TypeError: ufunc 'multiply' not supported for the input types, and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule 'safe'\n  ```\n- removed timedelta64 handling (introduced by #6558) in `Series.quantile`,\n  because `not np.isscalar` is always false and, in my testing,\n  numpy.percentile properly returns timedelta64 objects on numpy 1.7 & up.\n\nNo idea why np.percentile wasn't used originally, but will note that scipy.stats.scoreatpercentile existed first. Perhaps, when the scipy dependency was removed from pandas, the difference in rounding made copying scoreatpercentile the easiest way forward.  Will also note that scipy has deprecated scoreatpercentile in favor of np.percentile.\n"
