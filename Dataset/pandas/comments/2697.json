    "body": "Well the problem here is that if you have an integer above 2^53 and some other number in the column causes the entire column to be interpreted as float64, say, you are going to lose precision. The cutoff for reliable representation of integers in double-precision numbers is approx 2^53. I'm not sure if this can be fixed actually. Marking for \"someday\" or potentially close\n"

    "body": "Not quite.  The reason for the loss of precision in the first case is because `from_csv` defaults `parse_dates=True`, which causes those floats to be butchered by attempts to convert these values to dates during index creation.  You can see for yourself by passing in `parse_dates=True` to `read_csv`.\n\n``` python\n>>> from pandas import read_csv, DataFrame\n>>> from pandas.compat import StringIO\n>>> data = 'a\\n135217135789158401\\n1352171357E+5'\n>>> df = read_csv(StringIO(data), index_col=0, parse_dates=True)\n>>> print(df.index[0] == 135217135789158401)\nFalse\n>>> print(df.index[0] == 1352171357E+5)\nFalse\n```\n\nYou can see here that specifying `parse_dates=False` does the trick:\n\n``` python\n>>> df = DataFrame.from_csv(StringIO(data), parse_dates=False)\n>>> print(df.index[0] == 135217135789158401)\nTrue\n>>> print(df.index[0] == 1352171357E+5)\nTrue\n```\n\nAs for the second example, I can't reproduce that anymore:\n\n``` python\n>>> data = 'a\\n99999999999\\n123456789012345\\n1234E+0'\n>>> df = DataFrame.from_csv(StringIO(data), parse_dates=False)\n>>> print(df.index[0] == 99999999999)\nTrue\n>>> print(df.index[1] == 123456789012345)\nTrue\n>>> print(df.index[2] == 1234)\nTrue\n```\n\nThe `parse_dates` behaviour is not bugged but intended behaviour, as it is stated clearly in documentation <a href=\"https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/df2d9ab917a1ef4732cfb6c3317432f60c071074/pandas/io/parsers.py#L150\">here</a>.  While I do find it unusual that `parse_dates=False` by default, that too is laid out clearly in documentation <a href=\"https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/df2d9ab917a1ef4732cfb6c3317432f60c071074/pandas/core/frame.py#L1191\">here</a>.\n\nI think the \"enhancement\" here would be to just clarify documentation in `from_csv` to match that of `read_csv` so that no confusion is to be had.  @jreback what do you think?\n"
