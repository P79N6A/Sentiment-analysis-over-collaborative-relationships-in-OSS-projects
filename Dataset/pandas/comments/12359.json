But then I think `zlib` doesn't really return anything that's shared, even for small strings (I didn't manage to get any performance warnings with crafted cases).\n\nI'm only minimally familiar with the C-API.  Is it possible that, although the ref count is 2, the string is interned during the query (maybe by `getrefcount` itself) and never destroyed, so subsequent attempts to use that string give unexpected results?\n\nIn moving data around, this `n` vs `2n` memory issue is very common, but I think it is a legit concern, and in this case it does seem a bit wasteful.\n"

I have checked the source for zlib and blosc to confirm that in their current state they will not be interning the strings; however, the test cases are to guard against changes to the implementation of these libraries. I also have open PRs upstream to both CPython and blosc that will make these functions return mutable buffers. We will need to support this hack for some time (especially with zlib) but at least there will be a more supported code path. I have an idea for a function that will factor out this logic a bit and ensure that users cannot get a reference back to the invalid bytes object. Right now this object is still exposed as `df._data.blocks[n].values.base.base` which is not ideal but also pretty deeply hidden/\n"
