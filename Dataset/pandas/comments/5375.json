There was a similar situation with _define_paths, but in this case the duplicated code is shared by two classes, so it would have to sit \"far away\" in the module.

I'm really down in the weeds with unfamiliar parts of the code.\n\nIf we were wiling to _sort_ non-monotonic frames (and probably series too, for consistency) there would be an easy way out.
