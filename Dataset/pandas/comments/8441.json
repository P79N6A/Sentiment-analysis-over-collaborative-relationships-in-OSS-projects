    "body": "this works in master/0.15.0 (releasing soon). as the `Categorical` type has been refactorted and now fully supports `object` dtypes for levels that are not regular (normally not used except for string type data). \n\nThat said, I think this is a really bad idea. I can't imagine a use case which needs this, as opposed to simply having another level. Tuples are overloaded in many different ways already and this probably will break working with these.\n\nTheir is an implicit guarantee (not really doced anywhere though), that level elements should be scalars (e.g. strings,numbers,datetimes). \n\nCan you explain why you are using this?\n\nclosing in any event as not a bug\n"
