    "body": "I had a virtualenv with a pre 0.18 of pandas and a slightly older numpy... I'm playing with Blaze at the moment so I did a `pip install --upgrade blaze` which also upgraded pandas and recompiled numpy - all was successful but obviously not. \n\nThere's obviously something going iffy locally somewhere (I suspect some object file somewhere given that numpy works and most of pandas works) - sorry for the noise. I'll debug more thoroughly later. \n"
