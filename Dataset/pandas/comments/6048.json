I thought it might be caused by me RDPing\ninto the box and using the clipboard during tests (unlikely but possible), but now that I think of \nit it's clear the test is inherently racy. If you run multiple CI jobs on the same\nbox they will ocassionally step on each other's toes. The clipboard is a shared global resource.\n"
