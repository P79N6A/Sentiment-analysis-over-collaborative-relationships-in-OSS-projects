While you seemed to have preferred to just ignore it (that was the impression I got when I wrote the `_validate_kwargs` method in a previous PR), @shoyer is advocating throwing an `Exception` instead.\n\nWhile I don't know how `searchsorted` will work in the future, but FYI, the way it works when you call `np.searchsorted` is that it checks whether the array-like object being passed in has its own `searchsorted` method.  If it does, it calls that method using the signature `(val, side=`left`, sorter=None)`.  If it does not have such a method, the object is wrapped in a `numpy` array and that array's `searchsorted` method is called instead.\n"

    "body": "ok, so to lay out a policy here which is compat with several goals.\n- we don't really need or want the `sorter` argument, but `numpy` requires it (as a positional). So am forced to accept it and document it as an argument that we just pass thru. So `Series` is good now, @gfyoung let's keep the modification where you put it (IOW have `Categorical/Index`) support this so its all in 1 place. Remove the `*args, **kwargs` checking. You can put back minimal tests for passing this thru (numpy will do all error checking). Make a note in the doc-string that this is just a pass thru argument.\n\nThe reasoning here is that we have a positional argument that we are forced to accept for compat reasons. We cannot easily ignore this w/o jumping thru a bunch of hoops. We are forced to have this in the doc-string.\n- other PR (about `np.round`) and stat functions. We _need_ to accept `out`, but explicity don't do anything or want this argument. Here let's check if its `None` (its in `**kwargs` already), if not raise a `TypeError` (we do this already). Further goal is since we are accepting `**kwargs` need to make sure that we dont take addtl args that are not in the doc-string.\n\nThe reasoning here is we have a kwargs argument that we don't want (and don't want in the doc-string), and can safely make sure its `None`\n\nBottom line is that we don't want to have arbitrary / odd argument in the doc-strings (and signatures) just for compat, unless we have to jump thru hoops to get rid of them. Having arguments which don't do anything is just bad practice in general and makes things even more confusing. \n\nIn particular I am (I guess was) making a case that `sorter` is a really numpy specific arg that in pandas space is completely useless and misleading (we NEVER need this, we ALREADY have a concept of an index and values; numpy NEEDS this because it doesn't).\n\nI think it is worthwhile to hide completely numpy specific useless things from the user. We do this for many many other cases. So philosophically I don't see any reason to digress here. The reason I am yielding is that there _is_ a slight usecase to support `np.searchsorted(...)` and the fact that numpy passes these positionally BACK to use (with `_wrap_it`), is just plain confusing (and @gfyoung has already opened a report on this, but this can't affect our decision here because of back-compat with older numpies).\n\nWe have in the past few years been more and more hiding numpy from end-user for normal cases. I think this is just going to increase to where you won't be able to TELL if numpy is there or not, it just won't matter at all. Therefor anything that can reduce friction with the end-user and reduce confusion is a good thing, even at the expense of some work-arounds.\n"

    "body": "Alright, let me see if I understand this correctly:\n\nFor compatibility reasons, we are going to add `sorter` as a **keyword** argument for all relevant data structures (i.e. `Index`, `Category`, `DataFrame`, etc...).  However, for the majority of these data structures (excluding `Series`), this will serve as a **pass thru** argument that will be validated as per @shoyer.  For `Series`, I am personally in favor of deprecating `sorter` because it's going to be confusing for the user if we support it for one data structure but not for the others.\n\nIn this case, I'll remove the `*args` and `**kwargs` checking and move that into my `np.round` PR and remove its dependency on this one.  Also, @jreback , unfortunately, it will have to be an `*args` thing because `numpy` passes it in internally as a positional argument despite accepting as a keyword!\n"
