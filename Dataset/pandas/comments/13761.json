    "body": "@jorisvandenbossche I hadn't thought about the docstrings before, still learning I guess. It looks like the build failed under 2.7 for some reason as well. I tried with raw docstrings and the Sphinx still converted them. \n\nMy last attempt was to use the raw docstrings and enclose the special characters (\"/s+\", etc.) in double back ticks, which keeps Sphinx from interpreting them. This works for the docs, but then the docstrings show the back ticks (see attached images). I searched the codebase for other examples of special characters in both the docstrings and documentation but couldn't find any. Anyone have any other ideas?\n\nDocs: \n![screen shot 2016-07-24 at 11 34 25 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7305354/17085732/6d78e3fe-5194-11e6-8c87-50848608d39e.png)\n\nDocstring:\n![screen shot 2016-07-24 at 11 35 47 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7305354/17085733/6d978ab6-5194-11e6-92d2-cdfccc8371d1.png)\n"

I found the warning box on this page helpful in understanding what's going on with Sphinx. \n\nMy interpretation is that the raw string ensures that sphinx sees the backslash, but that sphinx also uses the backslash itself to escape characters it uses (eg `*` for bold), so in this way to show a backslash in sphinx, you still need two of them in the raw string (or four in the python string), or put it in a literal code block, like you proposed now.\n"
