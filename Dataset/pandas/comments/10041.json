    "body": "Because dateutil doesn't support nanosecond, it looks little difficult to cover all the cases to nanoseconds (see #7907).\n\nOne option is to prepare a nanosecond parser to support some popular date formats. For example, change (or prepare separate function like) `np_datetime_string.c` to allow formats with other separators or without separators (like suggested in #9714).\n\nA PR would be appreciated :)\n"
