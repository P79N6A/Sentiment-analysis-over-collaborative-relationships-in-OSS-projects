    "body": "numexpr rarely raises itself (mainly on a type issue, which we catch), or the catchall (which Exception), I think if some other kind of error, don't remember. We only bail on the catchall\n\notherwise it is computed as normal (which can itself raise an exception, but only a weird case I think)\n\nso its not tested per se that calling from a data frame works (and uses numexpr when it is installed). \n\nI suppose you could add some functions to `expressions` which would set/unset a module level flag for the last computation done (and maybe status info, would have to sort of 'record' which path actually is taken)\n\nthat way you could do something like this:\n\n```\nfrom pandas.core import expressions as e\ne.set_test_mode(T)\nresult = big_df + 1\ntest_result = e.get_test_results()\n```\n\nand `get_test_mode` can return (and invalid the module level data which `set_test_mode` sets)\n\nand `test_result` could be say:\n\n```\ntest_result = dict(computation = ...., result = ...., path = ....)\n```\n\nwhatever\n"

    "body": "Update on this: everything passes now and I added all the standard arithmetic operators to the test cases. This exposed a regression where `__mod__` was given a `str_rep` of `*` instead of `%`. Unfortunately, I kept getting floating point exceptions when I ran the tests for `__mod__` accelerated by `numexpr`, so I just removed `str_rep` so it will use numpy's `operator.mod` instead. (I think this was added on 5/14, so doesn't need to go in `RELEASE.rst`)\n\nAccelerating `//` caused an inconsistency too (though I don't think it was actually set up) where, when dividing by zero, numpy returns `0.0000` whereas `numexpr` evaluates to `inf`. Not sure which is correct, so it's also not included.\n\nIn summary, this pull request adds test cases for `expressions.py` for all major operators and tests `Series` (which isn't currently accelerated) and `Frame` with >10,000 cells. It also fixes `__truediv__` to actually do truedivision when evaluated under `numexpr` (previously was doing integer/floor division) and fixes `__mod__` by removing the incorrect str_rep being passed to `numexpr`.\n"
