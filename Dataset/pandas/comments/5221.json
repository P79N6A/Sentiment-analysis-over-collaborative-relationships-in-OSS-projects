The only problem that I see is that this potentially ties us to specific numpy and IPython versions.  When you're changing this, can you make sure that the builds pass (i.e., at least build even if they generate warnings/failures because of numpy compat) with numpy 1.6, numpy 1.7, the numpy 1.8rc and numpy master, plus IPython 1.0 and IPython master. (maybe IPython 0.9?).  We don't have to add them to Travis, but I want to make sure that we're not entering some new issue with doc building.\n"

Numpydoc is also splitted into its own repo, so you wouldn't depend on the numpy version.\n\nFor ipython it could indeed be more difficult with different version of ipython itself, because it is included in ipython core.\n\nAnd for clarity, at the moment I just posted it here as an idea to discuss :-) (I have at the moment unfortunately not really the bandwith to look at it)\n"

    "body": "To add some historical perspective. The separate numpydoc is a recent venture, and the numpydoc extension couldn't always be depended on to be available just because numpy was installed. Similarly ipython_directive in IPython was broken for a long time as it wasn't much used and didn't keep up with internal IPython refactorings. It was fixed (and somewhat maintained in statsmodels) outside of IPython for a while, but not so much anymore.\n\nLong story short, the status quo has changed, so I'm +1 on going back to using the 'official' extensions.\n"

I suppose IPython's version cannot handle this, and this was introduced in pandas here: https://github.com/pydata/pandas/commit/0bc7fec8f1547ac345c0148eba14e694fb923f2e. Although this is used only once in the pandas docs: in faq.rst L84, but it causes the rest of the docs to build incorrectly.\n- There is now also on 'Out' prompt, but it is al little bit off (not aligned with the 'In' prompt)\n"

As far as I understand, this parameter is used when the code is intended to raise an exception (you want to show this in the docs), so you don't want to show up during the doc builds (because warnings/exceptions that are raised during the execution of the code in the ipython directive are also sent to the stdout (at least in the pandas version of the directive)). So you know that all warnings/exceptions you see in the console while building the docs is something you have to deal with.\n"
