    "body": "Wes tweeted a while ago 'Oh pylint, how you save me on a daily basis'.\nI am a [flake8](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8) user myself, but installed pylint. For potential future pull requests, to check added pandas code. My guess is that pandas does not use default config file, if this is the case would it be possible to share it? Also, somehow pylint seems to be relaxed on pep8. flake8 flags several pep8 errors, while pylint out of the box does not.\n"
