    "body": "Hey @changhiskhan check out my above changes, I was able to get about 4-5x improvement by switching to the fast ndarray zipper I wrote yesterday and calling `argsort` on an array of tuples. here was my test dataset:\n\n```\n\nfrom pandas import DataFrame\nimport numpy as np\nimport random\n\nk = 5\nn = 1000\n\nA = np.arange(k).repeat(n)\nB = np.tile(np.arange(k), n)\nrandom.shuffle(A)\nrandom.shuffle(B)\nframe = DataFrame({'A' : A, 'B' : B,\n                   'C' : np.random.randn(k * n)})\n```\n\nI made a slightly more complicated test dataset-- I'd love to get a stable sort going but I think it's going to be quicksort until someone writes mergesort or another stable sort for dtype=object\n\nwent from 16.4 ms to 3.5 ms, not too bad-- bottleneck is sorting the tuples of course\n"
