    "body": "Hey there-- I just made a commit to my branch with some modifications to your changes. \n\nI tried to merge your branch but there were some gnarly conflicts so I just decided to do it by hand-- I named the \"auto_x\" parameter to \"use_index\", so it has a similar effect. In the future could you make sure to merge the upstream changes before making changes? =) That will help avoid merge conflicts on down the road.\n\nhttps://github.com/wesm/pandas/commit/2db763fed6445f6dee49e97193b017b75a15f1b6\n\nThanks for your help,\nWes\n"
