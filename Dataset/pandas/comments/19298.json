Would love to make this a reality...\r\n\r\nI took a first look at how this could work for `diff` for Series, and it seems pretty simple (will attach a possible solution in a pull request shortly).\r\n\r\nFor DataFrames...\r\n* when `axis=0` i think we can get away with the same hack (also in pull request)\r\n* when `axis=1`...maybe we just don't allow them to use multiple periods if `axis=1`?\r\n\r\n(for shift, could apply a similar if-else block for `pandas.core.generic.NDFrame.shift`)"
