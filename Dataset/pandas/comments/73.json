The same for\nSeries, maybe called columns like DataFrame. I was needing one when\ntrying to allow joining a Series to a DataFrame until I found insert,\nthough insert doesn't allow you to append. Of course, I could just do\ndf['new_col'] = some_series, but I like the alignment index checking\nin join and friends.\n\"\n"
