    "body": "> can you comment on your objection?\r\n\r\nWell, that comes back to my initial objections to the `api` namespace :-) (so I should have pressed that more earlier ..) \r\nI am in favour of removing things of the top-level namespace (functions / sub-namespaces) that people shouldn't use (as we are doing), but in favour of adding things users *may* use.\r\n\r\nIn this specific case, what I also would do is creating an actual module (let it be `pandas.api.exceptions` or `pandas.exceptions`, that's even a bit different discussion) with the code in there, and let our other modules (in the io code, indexing code, etc) import the exceptions from there (instead the other way around as it is now). That gathers all our custom exceptions in one place (but on the other hand moves them away from where they are used, so that's not necessarily a net win), but also gives a consistent api to users. If they encounter such an exception, it is of the same type (I mean with same class path name) as the one they can use to catch it. And you minimize the chance to 'misuse' a private import.\r\n\r\nAnd to be clear, big +1 to make those exceptions more officially public!"

This leads to anyone just reaching in an using any old module (remember ``pandas.core.common``)? and then ties up the implementation by requiring almost internal deprecations when things are moved. The implementation should remain private.\r\n\r\nIts clear that *functions* and *classes* from ``pandas.*`` namespace are publicly accessible (we of course have been trying to reduce the vast number here).\r\n\r\nFurther a fair number of things have moved implementation wise to ``_libs``, implicitly private. But why should ``pandas.tools.merge`` or ``pandas.core.reshape`` be public at all? Its is a PITA to make these all explicitly private (leading _), so that was never done. \r\n\r\nI think a single-one place for API accessibility (and to be honest, we are talking about library *builders* here (on top-of-pandas)., is a really nice idea).\r\n\r\nyou have ``pandas.*`` and ``pandas.api.*``. Now you want instead to have ``pandas.exceptions`` as well. Where does this stop? we might as well go back to the original, which is very confusing, mixing *some* public and some *private* (maybe non-documented) apis.\r\n\r\nThe burden should NOT be in the current implementors in pandas. The *possible* API surface is so huge that it HAS to be limited. By default making a very simple. Hey this and this are public namespaces is MUCH simpler, that having a collection of specific namespaces that ARE public and some that are NOT (like ``pandas.exceptions`` and ``pandas.types`` are ok, but ``pandas.tools`` are NOT).\r\n\r\nThe point and the purpose of the ``pandas.api`` is to provide a flexible method of namespacing the public api.\r\n\r\n For example, how to expose ``pandas._libs/lib.infer_dtype`` (formerly ``pandas.lib.infer_dtype``), which is a useful function for libraries building upon pandas. This clearly belongs on ``pandas.api.lib.infer_dtype``. \r\n\r\nFurther I think it would be nice to have ``pandas.api.warnings`` AND ``pandas.api.exceptions`` (of course we would likely import all of these into ``pandas.api`` namespace anyhow, but the point is that is provides *organization* and a single place to look for things.\r\n\r\nI imagine that the ``pandas.api`` surface will continue to grow as a public vehicle, while the implementation is simply kept private and can be easily change / improved w/o impacting the user API at all.\r\n\r\nSure one can make an *exception* and put the exceptions in ``pandas.exceptions``, but as I have reasoned above, will just lead to *more* confusion.\r\n"

    "body": "@jreback I hear you about `DatetimeTZDtype`, but it turns out that doing zero-copy construction of a DataFrame containing Datetime+TZ data is extremely difficult (I managed to do it, but it was a chore), and uses non-public APIs. I accept that we've made our bed and now have to sleep in it, so at least from 0.20 forward it would be good to not move code or break the \"private\" API for getting access to DatetimeTZDtype and DatetimeTZBlock "
