Will that be a problem?\r\n\r\nFor comprehensive testing, what do you have in mind? I see a `pandas/tests/io/data` directory containing fixtures for (among others) stata. I'm happy to generate a file similar to the attached earlier with a larger set of fields.\r\n\r\nFundamentally I know of two types of Stata date/time fields - those with day precision (val += 1 adds a single day) and with microsecond precision.\r\n\r\nEverything beyond that I understand only to be formatting options similar to `strftime`.\r\n\r\nAlso there's the wrinkle of `%tC` accounting for leap seconds and `%tc` ignoring leap seconds, but pandas already handles this"
