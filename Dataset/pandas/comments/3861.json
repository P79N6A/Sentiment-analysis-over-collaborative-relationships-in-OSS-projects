    "body": "Fully agreed. But the setuptools spec says that when a dependency is needed both in runtime and in \"setup\" time, it needs to be added to both `setup_requires` and `install_requires`.\n\nThis causes buildout to assemble `setup_requires` packages first, and correctly makes them available to dependent packages during the setup phase. IMHO this is the desired behaviour for dependency resolution.\n\nMy point about the other libraries was that ideally, they should declare the same directive for all their setup-time dependencies as well :-)\n"
