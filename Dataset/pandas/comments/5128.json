Pyexcelerate isn't really stable enough or doesn't have enough formatting support for proper integration with Pandas.\n\nThat is also why the PR has stagnated for several months. I was waiting for the Pyexcelerate feature set to catch up.\n\nAll in all, it probably isn't worth adding at this stage.  \n"
