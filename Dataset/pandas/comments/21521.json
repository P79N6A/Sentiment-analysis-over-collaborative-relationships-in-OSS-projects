However, that was the API as of pandas 0.22.0, so any change to it should really be made gradually, with a `DeprecationWarning`, etc.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the regression also affects cases where the meaning is unambiguous:\r\n```python\r\n>>> pd.DataFrame([[1,np.nan,np.nan,np.nan]]).T.groupby(np.array([1,1,2,2])).ffill()\r\n   NaN    0\r\n0    1  1.0\r\n1    1  1.0\r\n2    2  NaN\r\n3    2  NaN\r\n>>> pd.DataFrame([[1,np.nan,np.nan,np.nan]]).T.groupby(pd.Series([1,1,2,2])).ffill()\r\n   NaN    0\r\n0    1  1.0\r\n1    1  1.0\r\n2    2  NaN\r\n3    2  NaN\r\n```"

Looking at it the problem is going to stem from the below:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/f1ffc5fae06a7294dc831887b0d76177aec9b708/pandas/core/groupby/groupby.py#L4839\r\n\r\nSome kind of differentiation there between labels and arbitrary values could help determine whether or not the grouping should be included in the output or not.
