    "body": "This is as expected.\n\nPandas is quite restrictive when astyping `datetime64` and `timedelta64` types. These are kept internally as `datetime64[ns]` and `timedelta64[ns]` so pretty much only object dtype is allowed (timedeltat64 can be cast slightly different; its in the docs: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/timeseries.html#time-deltas-conversions)\n\nThe int64 you are getting back in essentially (for datetime64) is the nanoseconds since 1970, and is used for all sorts of things internally (numpy has the same reference).\n\nWhat are you doing that you actually need to astype these? (their is a limited set of operations where you would actually want to astype).\n\nAlll that said; this could be doc'd better. Care to do a PR?\n"
