    "body": "I never liked the term \"adjustment\" -- which predates me.\n\nSuppose you had a series with an infinite history: `x[t]`, `x[t-1]`, `x[t-2]`, etc.\nThen, assuming convergence, you could define:\n\n```\n(1) y[t] = (x[t] + (1-a)*x[t-1] + (1-a)^2*x[t-2] + ...) / (1 + (1-a) + (1-a)^2 + ...)\n         = (x[t] + (1-a)*x[t-1] + (1-a)^2*x[t-2] + ...) * a\n```\n\n(since the denominator is equal to `1 / (1 - (1-a)) = 1/a`).\n\nNow it's pretty easy to see that the `y[t]` satisfy:\n\n```\n(2) y[t] = a*x[t] + (1-a)*y[t-1].\n```\n\nSo far so good. Now in reality of course we do not have series with infinite histories. So how do we define the exponentially weighted averages for finite series? There are (at least) two plausible definitions:\n\nThe first option, which in Pandas is specified using `adjust=True`, is to follow `(1)` above and define:\n\n```\n(1) y[t] = (x[t] + (1-a)*x[t-1] + (1-a)^2*x[t-2] + ... + (1-a)^n*x[t-n]) /\n           (1 + (1-a) + (1-a)^2 + ... + (1-a)^n).\n```\n\nThe second option, which in Pandas is specified using `adjust=False`, is to follow `(2)` above and define:\n\n```\n(2) (i)  y[0] = x[0]; and\n    (ii) y[t] = a*x[t] + (1-a)*y[t-1] for t>0.\n```\n\nThese two methods will in general produce different results (though the difference will decrease the farther out one goes). Personally I find `(1)` more intuitive -- and this is the default in Pandas.\n\nOther than the unfortunate choice of the parameter name `adjust`, I think the docs are now reasonably clear about the two options. But by all means feel free to submit a PR adding clarifications...\n\nI am not familiar with \"adaptive-repose single exponential smoothing\", but suspect that that is something different.\n"

    "body": "I'd go even further and say that the unadjusted formula is not only less intuitive, but incorrect for finite series. In order to use it you have to assume that \"weight\" series is already infinite-ish and the first element is not an ordinary value, but rather a prior knowledge of the whole infinite-ish series. Intuitively this gives the first value much more weight and that corresponds to the maths.\n\nThis is a valid scenario, for example, when you're calculating ewma for some time series data period-by-period and you are rolling over to the next period. This is when you'd prepend the weighted last element to the next period series changing it from\n\n```\nt[period+1, 0]: v0\nt[period+1, 1]: v1\n...\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nt[period, N-1]: ewma(t[i, N-1])\nt[period+1, 0]: v0\nt[period+1, 1]: v1\n```\n\nand use the \"unadjusted\" formula.\n\nMaybe the kwarg could be renamed to \"assume_infinite_history\" or something alike. Or, going more radical, maybe we could use replace it with `prior` kwarg that, if not None, chooses the unadjusted formula with specified value as prior knowledge.\n"
