    "body": "Currently this will only work naively, that is the Intervals that are returned are strings\ne.g. `(7.5, 10]`. In 0.16 their is work being done on a Interval/IntervalIndex which will allow this to actually be sorted in a certain order. see #8707 \n\nas always pull-requests are welcome to work on these issues. (though reporting them makes good tests cases too!)\n"
