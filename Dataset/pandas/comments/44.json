I think you want:\n\n```\nfrom pandas.core.datetools import normalize_date\ndaily_ts = ts.groupby(normalize_date).aggregate(np.nansum)\n\n# alternately\ndaily_ts = ts.groupby(normalize_date).aggregate(Series.sum)\n```\n\nI actually plan to make this work (right now it does, but not with NaNs...making a note to make the change to the code soon):\n\n```\ndaily_ts = ts.groupby(normalize_date).sum()\n```\n\nFor converting to calendar day frequency, ts.asfreq(datetools.day) will do\n\nHope this helps\n"
