One of them is a _list of ints representing years_. An array of ints are interpreted as ordinals, but a list is coerced to years within the `Period` constructor.\n\nHere's an example: https://github.com/SixtyCapital/pandas/blob/master/pandas/tseries/tests/test_period.py#L2216\n\nWhat do you think about not allowing that?\n"

My fear is that there's a lot of pandas that relies on assertion above, and that going down this road would makePeriodIndexneed _more_ special casing throughout the library. And I would love to see less, both forPeriodIndex` and everything else!\n\nYou mean that people are actually constructing this like `PeriodIndex(idx.values)`? and expecting it to work? in external code, really? \n\nIf you can fix up the internal consistency, does anything actually break? (e.g. create `PeriodIndex.from_ordinals` then move all internal code to use that). \n"

    "body": "@jorisvandenbossche Good call. There is one significant slow down, by about 30x: [`time_from_pydatetime`](https://github.com/SixtyCapital/pandas/blob/period-float/asv_bench/benchmarks/period.py#L15), which cooerces python datetimes to Periods.\r\n\r\nI've tried to debug this, but am struggling a bit and could do with some help (and general guidance on how to approach these problems). So far:\r\n- The `Period` constructor is being called by each object within `period.extract_ordinals`, and that's what's taking all the time\r\n- The `Period` constructor then calls [`get_period_ordinal`](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/src/period_helper.c#L1151), which somewhere calls into `to_offset`:\r\n```python\r\n 0.183 __new__  pandas/tseries/period.py:183\r\n├─ 0.168 wrapper  pandas/util/decorators.py:65\r\n│  └─ 0.150 to_offset  pandas/tseries/frequencies.py:453\r\n│     ├─ 0.089 get_stride_from_decimal  pandas/tseries/frequencies.py:186\r\n│     │  └─ 0.086 isclose  numpy/core/numeric.py:2375\r\n│     │     ├─ 0.032 within_tol  numpy/core/numeric.py:2434\r\n│     │     └─ 0.021 all  numpy/core/fromnumeric.py:1987\r\n│     │        ├─ 0.013 _all  numpy/core/_methods.py:40\r\n│     │        └─ 0.003 asanyarray  numpy/core/numeric.py:484\r\n│     ├─ 0.019 get_offset  pandas/tseries/frequencies.py:605\r\n│     │  └─ 0.014 copy  pandas/tseries/offsets.py:306\r\n│     │     └─ 0.013 __init__  pandas/tseries/offsets.py:192\r\n│     ├─ 0.014 __mul__  pandas/tseries/offsets.py:412\r\n│     │  └─ 0.006 __init__  pandas/tseries/offsets.py:192\r\n│     │     └─ 0.004 _determine_offset  pandas/tseries/offsets.py:198\r\n│     │        └─ 0.003 <genexpr>  pandas/tseries/offsets.py:203\r\n│     └─ 0.008 split  re.py:195\r\n└─ 0.014 get_freq_code  pandas/tseries/frequencies.py:300\r\n   └─ 0.003 _period_str_to_code  pandas/tseries/frequencies.py:732\r\n```\r\n\r\nApart from exactly how the code traces through:\r\n- I'm not sure how _these changes_ should make an impact on this code path \r\n- Does this matter? Coercing from python datetime isn't a common use case\r\n\r\n\r\nCC @sinhrks "
