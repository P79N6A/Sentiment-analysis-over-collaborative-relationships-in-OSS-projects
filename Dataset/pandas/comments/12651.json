    "body": "@jreback I looked into this but am confused as to how to implement the cross-linking in the docstrings. The expanding function for dataframes and series don't have a doc page for .sum, .product, etc. As I understand it this is just chaining the .expanding method with the .sum method, so there shouldn't be a separate doc page right?\n\nAs an alternative we could just cross-link .expanding to all of the .cum\\* and vice-versa. But I'm not sure if that's what you were going for. \n"
