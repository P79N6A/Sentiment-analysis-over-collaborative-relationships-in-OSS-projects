    "body": "I haven't looked into `MultiIndex` but in my mind it makes more sense to model it after a Int/string index or normal numpy backed ones, as `Categorical` is in my mind a `np.array` and so should simple get all the methods to make it work as a \"backend\" of an Index. The only difference to a string is that i can be differently sorted (`\"one\" < \"two\" < \"three\"`) and that the categorical should be accessible like in `Series.cat`.\n\nSo this might be as easy as coping the Index type for string, make that accept only a `Categorical`as input, make sure that the `Index` constructor maps to that and then see what breaks with a `AttributeError`.\n"

Should the new index always be a `CategoricalIndex`? Even if some values do not have matching categories in the original categorical? For CategoricalIndex and IntervalIndex, I think we'll need to define a special rule that using `.loc` with values not found in the index is not possible.\n"
