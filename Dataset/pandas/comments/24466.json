    "body": "The reason why \"snap_backward\" behavior was not included was because I didn't think shifting back to `'[time]:59:59.999999999'` would be entirely useful. If it would be, it could be added along with `shift` (\"snap_forward\")\r\n\r\n 'shift_backward' / 'shift_forward' behavior could be added as well. `nonexistent` could take a timedelta-like object and the nonexistent times could be shifted by that difference instead."
