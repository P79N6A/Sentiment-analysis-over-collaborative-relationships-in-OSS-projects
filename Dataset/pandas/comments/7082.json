I don't know if we can lay down some suggestions/code for dealing with that data.  For example, an IS_DST field along with a MySQL DATETIME field.  It's unfortunate that the capability of MySQL is so limiting in this respect.\n"

    "body": "No, not yet tested NaT/None conversions (and there are certainly things not working with that, see #2754). \n@rockg Indeed we should see what we do with timezones, but here, even just a simple datetime isn't even working with mysql (but not due to mysql, but pymysql I think). For timezones, I think we should first ensure it works (does not error, maybe by storing it as utc), and then later maybe see to add options to store it in some other way. If you have concrete ideas of proposals for that, certainly let that know. Although I think eg storing it as a seperate column is up to the user to do this themselves.\n"
