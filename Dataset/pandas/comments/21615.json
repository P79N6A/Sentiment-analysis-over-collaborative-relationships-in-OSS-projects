    "body": "> it looks like the con argument of pandas.to_sql must be sqlalchemy.engine.Engine or sqlite3.Connection,\r\n\r\nThat is correct, as the documentation states.\r\n\r\n>  why doesn't it support pymysql.connection as pd.read_sql do?\r\n\r\nThis is because `slqalchemy` provides us all the handling of database flavor specificities, on which we rely to make `to_sql` work for all database flavors that `sqlalchemy` supports. \r\nFor reading queries (not tables), however, there is almost nothing database specific (the only thing the connection needs to support is a `execute` and `fetchall`), so the sqlite based version also works for other flavors."
