Namely, for `.union`, if the names are the same, or only one is specified, but the other is not, then take the name, but if the names are different, set the name to `None`.

    "body": "Following up on my question to @jreback above about the behaviors, I think the behavior of `.union` and `.intersection` with respect to names needs to be the _same_, using the pattern for intersection.  Namely, if the names are the same, use that name, otherwise return `None`.  The reason is that a chained union operation can then give odd results if the order of the union changes.  For example, let's say you have 3 indexes as follows:\r\n```\r\ni1 = pd.Index([1,2], name='i1')\r\ni2 = pd.Index([3,4], name='i2')\r\ni3 = pd.Index([5,6], name='i3')\r\n```\r\nAnd then you compute `i1.union(i2.union(i3))`, under the \"intersection\" behavior, the resulting name of this index is `None`.  But if we use the \"union\" behavior, then the name of the result is `\"i1\"`.  However, changing the order of the union, as in `(i1.union(i2)).union(i3)`, using the \"union\" behavior, the resulting name would be `\"i3\"`. \r\n\r\nIn fact, pandas 0.22.0 has a bug in the following case (which only occurs when one of the indexes in the union operation is empty, or if taking the union or intersection of 2 indexes that are the same, but have different names):\r\n```\r\nj1 = pd.Index([1,2], name='j1')\r\nj2 = pd.Index([], name='j2')\r\nj3 = pd.Index([], name='j3')\r\n```\r\nIn this case, `j1.union(j2).union(j3)` returns `Int64Index([1, 2], dtype='int64', name='j3')`, while just changing the order to `j3.union(j1).union(j2)` returns `Int64Index([1, 2], dtype='int64', name='j2')`. \r\n\r\nI hope to have straightened this out when I get things right in the pull request #19849.\r\n\r\n"
