These methods should be documented for somebody who requires more control over the index objects. The disclaimer at the beginning of the index section alludes to the fact that many of the index operations should be done at the dataframe and series level and I would really prefer to keep it that way. It will save people a lot of time looking for documentation rather than going to the source code. To make it more concrete we could put an asterix by the private methods. Please keep this around. \n"

    "body": "Just for clarification, I found the lack of DatetimeIndex documentation frustrating and that's why I put it in.  Personally, I find that DatetimeIndex is used by itself much more than Index as Index has standard replacements such as range, xrange but DatetimeIndex does not and that's why functions like date_range and the DatetimeIndex class are so important.  And since DatetimeIndex subclasses Index it made sense to separate those parts of the API.  Having the class specific documentation that @jorisvandenbossche points to is great.  I still think some of the methods that are removed should remain (all the DatetimeIndex stuff, Index->Selecting section, tolist, order, argsort).\n"
