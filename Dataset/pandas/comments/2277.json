So I guess it is a choice not to convert a Series object to a DataFrame object.\n\nBut why does a DataFrame object get converted to a Series object when I just select 1 column? For example if `df` is a DataFrame object, then `df[\"A\"]` would give a Series object, right? This made me think that reset_index would convert a Series object to a DataFrame object.\n"
