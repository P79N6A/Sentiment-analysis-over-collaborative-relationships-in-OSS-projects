    "body": "I agree that the `left_index=True, right_index=True` is rather verbose, and some improvement of the API is welcome here. Thanks for initiating this!\n\nBut I also agree this (using `on=pd.Index`) is bit hacky, or at least, not really consistent with how such things are done in the rest of pandas.\n\nSo maybe it is also worth looking at what could be alternatives, before deciding on the API?\n- a new keyword, e.g. `on_index=True`\n- promote `df1.join(df2)`, which joins on the index by default\n- add a `pd.join(df1, df2)` that does the same as `DataFrame.join` (similar to pd.merge vs DataFrame.merge). So a `pd.merge` alternative that has different defaults\n- ...\n\nOther ideas?\n"
