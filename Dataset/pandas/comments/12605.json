    "body": "can you add some tests for this (e.g. the example from the issue). \nThe 2.7_LOCALE build (the 2nd one down on the travis builds), does NOT have numexpr installed (its the only one). So if you mark this tests as slow it will get run there (and should pass with the python parser) and on the other builds (don't mark as slow) with the numexpr engine.\n\nSo the tests should assert the state of `_NUMEXPR_INSTALLED` (IOW whichever you are actually testsing), then run the query. I don't think there is an easy way to figure out which engine is actually used (we may have to do some gymnastics here to assert that)\n"
