    "body": "@toddrme2178 I looked at it again and the compiler's right (obviously!) in the case where it _doesn't_ raise an error, you still get to the end of the function. I changed the function to return the same import array retval right afterwards, so that the function signature is always correct.  Certainly a little bit clunky - I think functions are supposed to return different things if they can raise exceptions in Python 2 and Python 3?\n\nAnyways, I have a PR up, please take a look.\n"
