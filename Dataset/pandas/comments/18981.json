    "body": "@teeger : Thanks for the issue!  Unfortunately, your issue is hard to reproduce because we can't just access the SQL server that you included in code.  Secondly, the fact that there is no error message means that the code probably didn't break AFAICT, but rather that there is something fishy with your database.\r\n\r\nI would have a look there to see if there's anything problematic.  At this point, I think `pandas` is in the clear unless further information is provided to show otherwise."
