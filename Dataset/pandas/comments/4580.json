    "body": "@mindw If you feel like renaming the test that's fine, as long as it passes. Also, your code is not Python 3 compatible without running `2to3` (we don't run that). To make it Python 3 compatible, you'll have to add the `url*` import stuff (handling `ImportError` and so forth for the different Python versions) to `pandas/compat/__init__.py`. This will be annoying for you since there was a lot of mixing of the contents of the `url*` libraries from Python 2 to Python 3, see [here](http://pythonhosted.org/six/#module-six.moves). One option is to just add what you need so that you don't have million `try..except ImportError` clauses everywhere. That's essentially what we do now: cherry pick from the [`six`](http://pythonhosted.org/six/) package.\n\nThose Travis errors are spurious errors unrelated to your code.\n"

    "body": "On your six comment:\n\nThere were a number of items that we needed to tweak from six. For example, `iteritems` and `items` return totally different things, so the `compat.iteritems` needed to try calling `iteritems` first and, if that's not available, call `items`. (Additionally, the way that six does it means that it produces an intermediary list in Python 2), similar rationale for `itervalues` and `iterkeys`. Plus, we added functions that produced lists instead of iterators (`lrange`, `lmap`, `lfilter`), because some pandas/numpy functions are sensitive to getting iterators instead of lists and needed to account for that.  Finally, we needed to add moves for `long` and `int` and I preferred to flatten the namespace (i.e., `StringIO` is under `six`, whereas `cStringIO` is under `six.moves`) and have everything imported from the same place. Plus, it's a net positive to have fewer dependencies.\n\nThat said, as noted in the release notes, and the LICENSE directory (and I think in `compat/__init__.py` too), we did move over quite a bit of the concepts or code from the six module, which is why there is a SIX license included with pandas.\n\nI really like the six module and I think the author used a very elegant model for turning a single file package into a module with multiple (and dynamic) namespaces, but I like the explicitness and clarity of having those imports localized into a single location within pandas.\n\nI didn't even realize that the url imports weren't a part of `six` - at the time I had looked them up myself and added some of them to `io/common.py`.\n"
