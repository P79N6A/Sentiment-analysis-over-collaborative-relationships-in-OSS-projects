    "body": "an alternative is to deprecate `ix` and `xs` (documentation-wise ) and declare `loc`,`.iloc`\nto be the \"it\" from now on. That's how I think of them ever since 0.11.\nWe have to support `ix` and `xs`  for legacy code, but we're not required to advocate them \nto new users. Doing that will only make a difference to the underlying issue if we can keep `loc` and `iloc`\nsane going forward, though.  https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/6249\n\nI'm going to coin the term \"convenience creep\" here, for future use. \nHell, for past use:  #5655 , #5874, #5954.\n"
