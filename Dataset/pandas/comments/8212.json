It is evident from our test suites (pandas/io/tests/test_excel.py, function 'test_reader_special_dtypes') that this is actually already implemented!\n\nThe way it works is via the 'converters' keyword argument to pandas.read_excel. This is passed down all the way to the parser:\n\nread_excel --> ExcelFile._parse_excel --> TextParser --> TextFileReader._clean_options/_make_engine\n\nSo we just need to document this. If that's ok with you folks, I'll just make a minimal commit containing another parameter in the docstring(s) and make a pull request.\nOr do you guys prefer to use 'dtypes' as a kwarg instead of 'converters'? numpy.loadtxt and numpy.genfromtxt support 'dtype' and 'converters', but not 'dtypes', so I'd be for keeping 'converters'.\n"

    "body": "Actually, I tested `converters` a bit more and it has issues with missing values. For instance, if you write `converters={'mycol': int}` and a cell is empty, the parser defaults to empty string so when it tries to call `int(mycell)` it raises\n\n``` python\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: ''\n```\n\nThis happens in `_convert_to_ndarrays` in pandas.io.parsers.py, while calling pandas.lib.map_infer. This is in my opinion a plain bug. The parser should _first_ check for missing values, and _then_ convert only cells that do not contain missing values, but now it's the opposite: it first tries to convert everything to int, fails with an exception, and never gets to see that there was nothing to convert!\n\nSo my suggestion: I close this bug by reversing the order of the operations:\n\ncheck for missing <--> convert dtype\n\nand then I add a docstring to read_excel for `converters`. The `dtypes` change can come in a second step.\n"
