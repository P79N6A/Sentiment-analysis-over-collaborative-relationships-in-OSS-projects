I did read it over multiple times, but managed to miss that.  \n\nI am coming at things from a 'translate this sql into pandas commands' sort of place, and trying to figure out what some of the \"rules\" are.  Maybe a recipe book would be good here?  \n\nI realized that indexing is at the heart of what pandas does (and you seem to one of the few people who grok why R-style data.frames actually matter -- looking at you scipy!).  There is a lot there in the docs, and I will think if there is some way of better explaining it (as an outsider!).  \n"

    "body": "Cool. Yeah the indexing is really a critical component in a lot of applications-- but sometimes you just want a SQL-table-like object.\n\nLike as the result of a groupby, suppose you wanted to iterate through subgroups and do something intelligent with the results or each subgroup-- the MultiIndex allows you to select out subgroups in O(1) basically. You also have all that indexing information if you wanted to reshape the groupby result into a \"pivot-table-like\" DataFrame for display on a webpage or in the console or whatever. Lots of cool things you can do-- and quite a few things that are pretty difficult (or very slow) to do in R.\n\nI will say that documentation is pretty much the bane of my existence, which is funny because I'm writing a book on Python for Data Analysis (largely using pandas). There I really need to invest some energy in explaining this stuff well and education about best practices. Any help that I can get from folks like you (\"outsiders\") on the online sphinx documentation would be a huge help\n"
