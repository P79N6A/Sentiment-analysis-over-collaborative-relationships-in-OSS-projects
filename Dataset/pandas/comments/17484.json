I created a new set of DataFrame helpers to support this change and I refactored the existing groupby column/index logic (#14432) to use these as well. I haven't revisited my ``sort_values`` updates in #17361 yet, but I should be able to rely on these same helpers there too. \r\n\r\nDoes this general approach look reasonable @jreback, @jorisvandenbossche, @gfyoung, and @TomAugspurger?

    "body": "Thanks for looking things over @jorisvandenbossche. I'll address the specific comments in an update soon but wanted to follow up on a few of your general points.\r\n\r\n1) Yes, I agree that it makes sense for ambiguous index/column combinations to eventually fail in the same way that duplicate columns now fail.  Let me know if there's any language in the `FutureWarning` or in my comments in the code that you'd like me to change to make this future intention clearer.\r\n\r\n2) I'm planning to use the `axis=1` case for a couple of these new methods in my next update to #17361 (The `sort_values` analog of this PR) since `sort_values` supports that `axis` parameter.  My hope was that these methods would make it easier to add mixed column/index support to other operations in the future, though `sort_values` is the only remaining operation on my personal wishlist at the moment.\r\n\r\n3) I restricted index level references to strings at the moment partially because I wasn't clear on how to check for the full set of valid label/level reference types.  I'm happy to open this up if there's a clear way to check this.\r\n\r\n4) I'll need to think some more about `join`. Does anyone else have thoughts on this?\r\n\r\n"
