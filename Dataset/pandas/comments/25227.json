As Alpine+Python3.6 was the initial origin for tackling the `pyproject.toml` again, I made this change.\r\n\r\nThis might ensure it works on alpine+python3.6, but then can give errors on other platforms in case you would eg do `pip install pandas numpy=1.12 --no-binary :all:` (or without the no-binary on platforms that don't have wheels, but where numpy 1.12 works).\r\n\r\nI am not sure what the best way to go is here (although I am inclined to keep it at the lowest we support (1.12), so it works when numpy 1.12 works on the specific platform). \r\nBut, it is a problem that many other packages also will encounter when adding (back) pyproject.toml file, like scipy, scikit-learn, ... So it might be interesting to know what they would do / to be consistent (as often those packages will be installed together)\r\n\r\ncc @rgommers (since you were involved in the pyproject.toml file in scipy)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "> Yes, this is the only correct way to do it, you have to build against the lowest supported numpy version for each Python version.\r\n\r\nYes, that's what we are doing (and did before as well before we removed the pyproject.toml again .. just like scipy did as well :)). \r\nBut the question was more specifically about the situation for alpine linux, where apparently, numpy 1.12 doesn't work for python 3.6. So pinning to numpy 1.12, will mean that people on alpine (where typically no wheels are available so this pyproject.toml is of relevance) will still need to do a `--no-build-isolation` or `--no-use-pep517` to be able to install pandas. \r\nBut I suppose there is not really a way around that?"
