We don't have an implementation yet for left-edged windows.  If you would like to add that, you're more than welcome!\r\n\r\n* The \"following 7 days\" is essentially asking for left-edged windows, so my previous point applies.\r\n\r\n* You can change inclusion by passing in the `closed ` parameter.\r\n\r\n* Regarding `df1`, yikes!  Yeah, something looks buggy there IINM.  Have a look around and see if there's anything funny in our code that jumps out."

    "body": "I have a simmilar problem, but with sets:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\npd.Series(data=[{1},{2},{3},{4}], index=[1,2,3,4]).rolling(2).apply(list)\r\n\r\n# yields:\r\n# 1    {1}\r\n# 2    {2}\r\n# 3    {3}\r\n# 4    {4}\r\n# dtype: object\r\n\r\n# yet I should be something like:\r\n# 1    None\r\n# 2    [{1},{2}]\r\n# 3    [{2},{3}]\r\n# 4    [{3},{4}]\r\n# dtype: object\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n@jreback if `rolling` over _non first class elements_ is not supported `pandas` should either throw warning of fail with an error. IMO returning an unexpected invalid result is not correct behaviour. I spend a lot of time trying to find out what am I doing wrong that the rolling functions does not return what I expect Do you agree?"

For instance, you could want a window that was from 3 to the left to 5 to the right, or from 5 to the right to 10 to the right. It's about 1 month from official release."
