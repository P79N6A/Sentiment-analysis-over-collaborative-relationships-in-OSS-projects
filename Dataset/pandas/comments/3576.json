    "body": "@sanguineturtle `DataFrame` does not have a `name` attribute by default. As you probably know, though, Python objects have a `__dict__` attribute which is the instance's namespace and that allows one to assign arbitrary attributes at runtime to an instance (or a class). The reason `name` is getting dropped from this particular `DataFrame` instance is just that, you've assigned an attribute to an instance of a class and thus when `reorder_levels` creates a new instance that new instance correspondingly has a new namespace. You can assign a class variable if you want. So, this is not really an issue so much as a feature (or bug if you're feeling pessimistic) of the Python object model/runtime.\n"

    "body": "I see. Agreed - this is more along the lines of a feature request. The reason I like to have the DataFrame name attribute propagate is that I am using pandas to track 'labelled' matrices. I have a function that takes a DataFrame converts it to a matrix for computation and the returns it as a DataFrame. Therefore, when I do relevant data manipulations (such as reorder_levels()), it would be helpful for the name label to persist as a label of the overall matrix data. (i.e. country-product level export data). \n\nThe main benefit is that the matrix data can then be sorted and matched with other relevant data sources along their relevant axis (axis=0 and axis=1). Is there a Features Register?\n"
