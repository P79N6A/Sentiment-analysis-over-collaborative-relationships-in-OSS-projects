And when it comes to debugging code, a simple `print` can sometimes be just what you need, since it doesn't require you to set up a logging system to do a quick bit of debugging.\r\n\r\n> This does look useful, but the thing is i think you would need some sort of option to turn this on / off.\r\n> \r\n> maybe better to just implement this as a context manager around a block of code\r\n\r\nI do see the value in being able to turn it on or off, but writing it as a context manager requires reformatting of the code, rather than just adding a single line, so I personally prefer the simpler approach of commenting out the `tee`-line.\r\nOn the other hand, integrating with logging seems like a great idea, though I think that the option to use `print` should still exist, and be _easy_ and _fast_ to chose.\r\n\r\nI suspect that Pandas is used for a lot of exploratory data analysis, and for that usecase I think flexibility and ease-of-debugging trumps performance and scalability.\r\nThere is also the possibility that the (dafault) behaviour is set using `pd.set_option`, which already controls some printing and layout options, but if a `tee`-like function should also be able to interface with the logging-module, that might change the behaviour of Pandas too drastically... what do you think?\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso for the sake of discussion, do you agree that the pipelines could use some better debugging tools?\r\nIt is not like you can't debug them, but it could be easier, and that might discourage users from adapting pipelines.\r\n\r\nAnd just a new thought, could pandas have a `breakpoint()`-like function for making introspection easier with Python 3.7.2+ on a debugger (see [PEP573](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0553/))?\r\nSomething simple like\r\n```python\r\ndef pandas_breakpoint(df):\r\n    breakpoint()\r\n    return df\r\n```\r\nThat would make it easier to step thorough parts of a pipeline, without dealing with the guts of Pandas."
