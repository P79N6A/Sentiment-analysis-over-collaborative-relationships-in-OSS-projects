    "body": "this is a correct warning (though the message in this case is a bit inapplicable).\n\nYou are in fact setting a copy.\n\nYou prob don't care; it is mainly to address situations like:\n\n`df['foo'][0] = 123...` which sets the copy (and thus is not visible to the user)\n\nThis operation, make the `df` now point to a copy of the original\n\n```\ndf = df [df['column2']!=8]\n```\n\nIf you don't care about the 'original' frame, then its ok\n\nIf you are expecting that the \n\n```\ndf['column1'] = df['columns'] + 'c'\n```\n\nwould actually set the original frame (they are both called 'df' here which is confusing)\nthen you would be suprised.\n\nYou can completly turn off this warning by setting `pd.set_option('chained_assignement',None)`\n(this warning is mainly for new users to avoid setting the copy)\n\nor you could do:\n\n`df.is_copy = False` (after the indexing operation)\n\nNote that when you have the _same_ index as the original frame, this DOES NOT create a copy, so no warning is generated, it is only because of the indexing which ultimately calls `take` which causes a copy.\n\nCopies don't normally matter except when you are then trying to set them in a chained manner.\n"
