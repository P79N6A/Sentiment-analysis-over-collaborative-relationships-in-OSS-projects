    "body": "@jreback The use case I have in mind is either (1) distributing third-party software or (2) setting a \"check\" to stop myself from making queries that are too large. \n\nIn the first case, I make want to set the `max_size` parameter in the source code, at least say 2 GB. If that's too difficult to measure (and I think it might be), let's try by rows. `max_size` could be set to 10**9 rows default, larger or smaller by user-set parameter. \n\nIn case (2), it's the same logic. I may not know a priori how large my query will be on a 200 TB HDF5 file, but I don't want it to cause my python script to freeze/overload my RAM. So, I set `max_size` equal to 10**6 rows. This stops me from making a query that's too large. In this case, I can query by chunks, etc. \n"
