    "body": "I have most of a Cython implementation of a centered interval-tree together (based off the description on Wikipedia). I'm pretty pleased with the initial performance numbers vs banyan:\n\n```\nx = np.random.rand(1e5)\ny = x + 1e-4 * np.random.rand(1e5)\ntree = IntervalTree(x, y, leaf_size=100)\n\n%timeit tree = IntervalTree(x, y, leaf_size=100)\n%timeit tree.query(0.5)\n# 10 loops, best of 3: 41.9 ms per loop\n# 10000 loops, best of 3: 47.2 µs per loop\n\nimport banyan\n\nintervals = [((xi, yi), n) for n, (xi, yi) in enumerate(zip(x, y))]\nd = banyan.FrozenSortedDict(intervals, updator=banyan.OverlappingIntervalsUpdator)\n\n%timeit d = banyan.FrozenSortedDict(intervals, updator=banyan.OverlappingIntervalsUpdator)\n%timeit d.overlap_point(0.5)\n# 1 loops, best of 3: 301 ms per loop\n# 100 loops, best of 3: 15.3 ms per loop\n```\n\nYes, queries are 300x faster.\n\nI'll have more details + code (maybe a blog post?) up soon. The downside vs the augmented tree approach in banyan is that the centered interval tree only works for numeric values, not strings.\n\nAlthough I would like to use this for IntervalIndex (#7640), I would rather not bury this in pandas -- I think it makes to release it in an external project, which pandas can depend on, either explicitly or bundled via a git submodule.\n\n@jreback How we feel about adding external deps to pandas? My general feeling is that this would be a net plus for the community, but it does make packaging harder. This less of an issue with tools like conda and pip, though.\n"

    "body": "There are costs and benefits to either approach, both in development and in maintenance.  \n\nWhile I often speak out for the theoretical benefits of separable software packages I wouldn't, in general, impose recommendations to any project one way or the other.  \n\nThe practice of many dependencies can be annoying during development.  Hopefully improved package managers and build systems reduce these costs in the future.\n"
