I can say from experience that rolling a Windows VM for CI purposes from scratch with All The Things is not a small task and unfortunately Microsoft doesn't make it easy on us.\n\nI can offer financial support for this work (i.e. I will pay someone for their time--Bitcoin, USD, whatever you want -- to set something sustainable up for the pandas--and hopefully beyond--dev community). Gods know that pandas has been good to me and even if the money comes out of my own pocket it's a fair trade. \n\nI also have all of the windows software through Microsoft's B!zSpark program and can give ISOs and license keys to the people who need them.\n"
