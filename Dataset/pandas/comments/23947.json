But I've run up against a problem when I tried to fix that, since the `assert values.type == pa.bool_()` constrains the values in it to be `boolean`. Thus, adding in an `na_value` violates this. So, what is the expected behavior here? Should I modify the `_from_sequence` implementation inside `ArrowBoolArray` to treat `NaN`s differently?"
