It seems the Chapter 6 \"Pandas Tutorial\" has been removed from the text but not from the index... so all the page and index links after this are mismatching. What is worse, the pdf search is also showing this problem with wrong sectioning names. I would really appreciate if you could solve this issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the PDF in http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/pandas.pdf is still the 0.11.0 release, as @oscarvarto pointed out.\n\nI hope this helps. \n\nMany thanks!\n"
