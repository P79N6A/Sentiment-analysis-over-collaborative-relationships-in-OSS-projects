    "body": "Hello!  Thank you for all of your sincere help and my apologies for the delay - I have been ridiculously swamped these past two weeks.\n\n@TomAugspurger - yes, so the categorical columns I was referring to in the example dataset I uploaded were the first two - the so-called \"ccle_primary_site\" and \"ccle_primary_hist\" columns (ccle stands for cancer cell line encyclopedia and hist stands for histology).  The resistance column was just meant to color-code the two datasets from each other.\n\nWith regards to your example dataset, I think we're on the same page: your 'v' column used for coloring was just uniformly distributed over a [0,1] range instead of a bimodal distribution like the one I provided.\n\nThe type of categorical visualization I envision is similar to the far-left column of the \"progressive rendering\" on this [d3 page](https://syntagmatic.github.io/parallel-coordinates/) - it'd just be nice to be able to intermix categorical and numerical data across all columns.  As far as ordering goes, perhaps a default alphabetical order might be forgiving to stupid users like myself?\n\nMy final, extra icing-on-the-top request was to somehow reflect frequencies in our parallel coordinates plot.  With numerical data, this isn't so much an issue because such data tends to be different enough that clusters are visually identifiable but with clear-cut categories, such natural \"peak broadening\" goes away (for example - there isn't any great way to discern prevalence within categories).  Hence, I proposed artificially inflating categorical line widths based on frequencies - basically a mutant between a [\"parallel sets\"](https://eagereyes.org/parallel-sets) plot and parallel coordinates.  That being said, it might just be a horrible idea. :P\n\nAlso, I'm a bit of a Github newb - would I first need to code a parallel coordinates replacement for a pull request?  Thanks again for all of your help.\n"

I was thinking of simply using a mock object for the axes objects and verifying their attributes were being accessed.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Some context, I ended up with a new method called parallel_sets() which converts all of its inputs to a string, as if expecting categorical data always, via a string_to_integer dictionary, and plots those integers."

    "body": "Some thoughts on this issue:\r\n\r\n1. Why does `parallel_sets` need to be separate function from `parallel_coordinates`? It seems like this is what you would always want when categorical values are given as a column. `parallel_coordinates` needs to support different axes/tick-labels for this, but this is functionality that would be a major improvement for the original visualization.\r\n2. Why is `class_column` a required argument for `parallel_coordinates`? That seems very strange -- there's no inherent reason why parallel coordinates plots need to be colored.\r\n3. The static graphs produced by matplotlib pale in comparison to the JavaScript visualizations with dynamic brushing. So I'm not opposed to fixing up this functionality, but really matplotlib is not the best tool here."

From what I can read about Parallel Coordinates, it assumes each sample is a point in some n-d space and not necessarily from a category and in my PR it made sense to have two different functions. But support for different axes/tick-labels might be a better idea/simpler.\r\n2. The class_column is used given the general use-case for parallel_coordinates is visualization of multivariate data.\r\n3. Indeed, do you think it makes sense to fold in a js library (say Bokeh) as part of the standard visualization?"
