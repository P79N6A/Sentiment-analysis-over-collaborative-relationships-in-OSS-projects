    "body": "The expected use of this is that there is only one set of rules per holiday class.  Namely there is a one-to-one mapping between holiday calendars and rules.  Ideally, if you change the rules you would create a new class.  However, this isn't exactly obvious from how things work and I don't see the harm in making the cache on the instance rather than the class (see #6719) for some design discussion.\n"

    "body": "That seems like a strange design to me - if the rules are a class level attribute then there is no instance   level data stored on the class and all the methods could be classmethods and the user would never have to actually instantiate the subclass to use it.\n\nIt also seems contrary to [`AbstractHolidayCalendar.__init__`](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/a72d95163b4d268012709255d7a52bbe5c1a7eb6/pandas/tseries/holiday.py#L281) which specifically allows overriding the rules at an instance-level.\n"
