    "body": "@danielballan the two are not quite equivalent, since the read_table function selects from a table reflected from the database it can do much better type conversion than read_sql('select \\* from table'). We can't easily get the expected types from an sql statement without basically guessing from the returned values. Pandas does a good job of figuring it out, but Because read_table is limited to querying existing tables with known column types we can ensure the dataframe columns match the sql ones. Dive into `_harmonize_tables` to understand the difference.\n\nI also kept read_table separate because it's much easier to extend without cramming potentially mutually exclusive optional arguments. You'll see I already added a columns option so you can do e.g.\nread_table('people', engine, columns=['firstname','age'])\nYou get the columns specified with correct type convertion. And theres lots of room to add to this in the future e.g you make joins possible, all fully db agnostic.\n\nMerging with read_sql would result in a horrible mess of optional arguments that are valid or not depending on whether you give a sql statement or a table name, on top of the legacy support stuff already there. Thats just ugly design. Its much better to have two functions each with a clear and well defined scope than to ill advisedly cram all your functionality into one monster function. Its easier to read, understand, document, test, and debug - sql.read_sql reads an sql statement, sql.read_table reads a table from an sql database. They represent different levels of abstraction.\n\nIf read_table must be made top level (tho imho there's not much advantage to this) then it could be named read_sql_table instead.\n"
