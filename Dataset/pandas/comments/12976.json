    "body": "So this is a bit of an API design issue actually. The cython implementation of `Timestamp` is a sub-class of `datetime.datetime` (though this itself is a bit tricky). `NaT` is not technically a sub-class of `Timestamp`, but of the 'base' class here (`datetime.datetime`).\n\nHowever, a lot has changed since the beginning, and now we use `NaT` for `Timedelta` as well as `Period` missing value repr. Further `np.nan` is the `float` missing value, but also sub in for `strings`, `boolean`.\n\nSo we could take several paths here:\n\n1) missing values are base-classed on their own and don't have a specific dtype \n2) the missing value base class diverges to `datetimelike` (e.g. like `NaT`) and `non-datetimelike` (e.g. `np.nan`), kind of like now.\n3) We have base classes like above AND have specific dtypes for missing values. E.g. you would effectively have a `NaT` for `M8[ns]` and for `m8[ns]`.\n\nIn 1) and 2) you could make the objects respond to isinstance checks (e.g. `NaT` could be both a sub-class of `Timestamp` AND `Timedelta`).\n\nSo I am not sure that 3) really gains you a lot except more complexity, though you _do_ get the ability to then construct things that don't default e.g. `Series([pd.NaT_m8])` then would be dtypes `m8[ns]` rather than `M8[ns]`.\n\n1) is rather clean, with the inference based on the dtype of the container object; we can't really support this ATM, until: #11970 where all of this is abstracted away.\n\n2) _may_ be possible with some meta-class hackery / reorg at least for `datetimelikes`. again prob can't really change `np.nan` much.\n\nthoughts @wesm @sinhrks @jorisvandenbossche \n"
