    "body": "Hi @hmgaudecker \r\n\r\nI can replicate this, but the problem doesn't seem to be in the json-module. The following small program coredumps for me:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ns = pd.Series(['Wie häufig kommt Beraten / Informieren bei Ihrer Arbeit vor?'], dtype='object')\r\ns.astype('float64')\r\n```\r\nSmall variations make it stop crashing. I believe something is writing to a stray pointer, perhaps inside of numpy. Likely somehow related to the ä-character, but I can't quite pinpoint how.\r\n"

Either by writing outside an area of memory they have  allocated or by e.g. freeing some memory that is still is being used. The bug is in C or Cython-code but not in the json-module.\r\n\r\nMy example code is just supposed to throw an exception, not dump core."
