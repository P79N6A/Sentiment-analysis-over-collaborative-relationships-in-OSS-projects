I believe I tested y-p's update correctly, I did so by forking y-p's pandas repo and then physically overwriting the appropriate files with his commits, but it has not solved my problem. I can link my IPython notebook if it helps. Please let me know I did not test out the fix correctly.   Thanks for looking into the issue for me!\n"
