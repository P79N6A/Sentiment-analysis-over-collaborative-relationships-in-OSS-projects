    "body": "Yes ... the `replace` API is quite crowded. It's extremely flexible, but that flexibility seems to cause confusion among users (me too) and it's (sometimes) a PITA to debug (though debugging could be made easier by an internal refactor with no API changes).\n\n@jreback maybe we should refactor this API a bit. I think `replace` tries to do too much. I think it might actually explode very soon. Maybe something like \n- `replace`: scalar replacement\n- `replace_list`: replaces anything where `to_replace` or `value` is a list\n- `replace_mapping`: likewise for `dict`s/`Series`\n- `replace_regex`: replaces only regexes, alternatively allow a `regex` argument in the others, similar to how it works now.\n\nWhile this does add more names to the namespace, it's less of a strain on the working memory since you can look at some code with this API and say \"oh, this is replacement using a [dict, list, etc]\" rather than tracing all the way back up the stack to discover that the types weren't what you thought.\n"
