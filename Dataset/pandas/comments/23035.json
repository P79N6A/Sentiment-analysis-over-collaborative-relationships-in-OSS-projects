    "body": "@vograno looks like the same memory leak issue I reported in https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/23047? You posted this issue one day before mine, but I didn't see it until now!\r\n\r\n> In the program we use a bool vector to subset a dataset. If the dataset index is MultiIndex we observe a memory leak (as reported by the print statement). If the index is a regular mono-index no such leak is observed.\r\n\r\nThis is consistent with our `tracemalloc` analysis that pinpointed the memory allocation to the following [lines](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v0.23.4/pandas/core/indexes/multi.py#L2681-L2691) in the `MultiIndex.equals` function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# pandas/core/indexes/multi.py:2683\r\nslabels = slabels[slabels != -1]\r\n# pandas/core/indexes/multi.py:2688\r\nolabels = olabels[olabels != -1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that we reported the issue a day apart, I wonder if this issue is a regression and has not always been in Pandas? Tagging @gfyoung...\r\n\r\n@vograno any workarounds you've found would also be appreciated!"

Old comment below for posterity.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nLooks to me like the leak was introduced in Pandas 0.23.4. When I run @vograno's example code above (for 20 iterations) in pandas 0.23.3 + python 3.6.6, I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\n204, 48, 144, -108, 108, -108, 108, -108, 108, -108, 107, -107, 107, -107, 107, -107, 107, -107, 107, -107, -107\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach line here shows the difference in memory allocation in MB from the previous iteration. In other words, allocation stabilizes after a few iterations. However, with pandas 0.23.4 + python 3.6.6, I get the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n336, 239, 336, 192, 192, 192, 191, 192, 192, 192, 191, 191, 192, 192, 191, 191, 192, 192, 192, 191, \r\n```\r\n\r\n@jorisvandenbossche I see you contributed the last two changes to `pandas/core/indexes/multi.py` ([history](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/commits/v0.23.4/pandas/core/indexes/multi.py)). However, these commits seem to have been part of Pandas since 0.23.2, so possibly the change was elsewhere. Any help appreciated.\r\n\r\n## Update\r\n\r\nThere were [very few changes](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/compare/v0.23.3...v0.23.4) in v0.23.4, none of which stick out to me as related to this bug. Odd."

I was hoping the leak would subside in numpy [1.15.2](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/04c76c58d6fcbb2031cc3392fcf88c8dce5f33c9/doc/release/1.15.2-notes.rst), which did fix a memory leak issue: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11951... although seemingly a different one than what's causing the pandas MultiIndex subset leak."

    "body": "In https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12122#issuecomment-430293579, @charris commented that this leak could be https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12037 titled \"Memory leak when slicing derived classes from Numpy\", which was fixed in https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/12127 and will be in the numpy 0.15.3 release.\r\n\r\nSeems like this could be the issue here as we've traced the issue to slicing multiindexes. If we do confirm this to be the issue, would we want to implement a RuntimeWarning in Pandas if the affected numpy version is in use and a MultiIndex is in use?"
