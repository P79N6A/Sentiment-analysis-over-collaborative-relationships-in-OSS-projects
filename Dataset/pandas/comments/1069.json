    "body": "I think part of the issue is that `DataFrame` borrows some of its semantics from `list`, and some from `numpy`.\n\n`bool(dataframe)` returns `True` when it is non-empty, like `list`. But `dataframe_a == dataframe_b` returns a new `DataFrame` of boolean values, whereas `list` would return a scalar bool. The usual test for this returned data frame, if we were using numpy, would be to call any() on it or all() to observe if some or all of the values are true. But `DataFrame` does not provide this functionality.\n"
