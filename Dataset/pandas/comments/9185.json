I would be ok with that route, thought IIRC that was MORE confusing.\n\nI normally don't like breaking from standard implementations. But the timedelta in the standard library is bad and np.timedelta64 is almost worse. I think `pd.Timedelta` improves greatly on both. If it was possible to use a meta-class to NOT sublcass I think it would be done a long time ago. But alas its not.\n"

    "body": "> The 'bug' you mentioned is really that the implementers of those libraries are using an implementation detail IMHO.\n\nI don't think that is strictly true. XlsxWriter accepts python `datetime` objects and converts them to Excel dates. To do this it uses `datetime.timedelta` objects. It doesn't rely on an \"implementation detail\". It follows the `datetime` API and documentation. xlwt does something similar.\n\nThe issue in #9139, from my point of view, is that `pandas.Timestamp` identifies as a `datetime` object (via `isinstance()`) but has different behaviour for `timedelta`.\n\nI'm not going to argue either way on that. I just wanted to clarify this in relation to XlsxWriter.\n"

    "body": "I have to say that I rather agree with @jmcnamara and @shoyer.\n\nBy implementing `pandas.Timedelta` as a `datetime.timedelta` subclass (and so by causing eg  `isinstance` checks for `datetime.timedelta` to work with `pandas.Timedelta`), we implicitly say that it is compatible with `datetime.timedelta`. \nAnd `datetime.timedelta` has a well defined API, which we are breaking in the subclass.\n\nIn my opinion, we should:\n- or not claim it to be a subclass (at least ensure that `isinstance` checks don't work), only that it is another type but has a 'similar' interface (with some clearly noted differences, as this is now also noted in the docs)\n- or ensure it has full compatibility with its parent class\n\nFor that last one, @jreback it is true that is was discussed when this new feature was implemented. But it is always possible we later think that there was a possibly better option. And there were some options discussed as a way around this, and I think there is no blame in changing thought about that. \nFor example, there is the `components` attribute:\n\n```\nIn [3]: td = pd.Timedelta('1 days 2 hours 4 seconds')\n\nIn [4]: td\nOut[4]: Timedelta('1 days 02:00:04')\n\nIn [5]: td.seconds\nOut[5]: 4L\n\nIn [6]: td.to_pytimedelta().seconds\nOut[6]: 7204\n\nIn [10]: td.components.seconds \nOut[10]: 4L\n```\n\nSo one option would be to only include the 'extra' attributes in the components attribute, and keep the only the days/seconds/microseconds on the Timedelta itself and have these compatible with datetime.timedelta.\n"
