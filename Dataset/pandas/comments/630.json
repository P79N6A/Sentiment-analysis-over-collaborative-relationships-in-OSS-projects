    "body": "@timmie, I recently began integrating sk.ts interval computations into the datetime64 branch (see Interval object, which is essentially a prototype reimplementation of DateObject). It remains an open question how exactly Interval & (likely future) Intervalindex will interact with datetime64-based Timestamp & DatetimeIndex. One question I keep coming back to: are intervals and timestamps semantically different enough that it's better not to conflate the two (ie, automatically mix within computations - ie, just have the appropriate helper conversion routines available)\n"
