    "body": "I did some digging  and found that the bug is not related to the non unique multi-index, it rather happens with all dataframes with an equal amount of rows as levels of multi-index (and the grouper not specified as level).\r\nDigging into the code i found that for special cases in groupby.py in line 2640 the keys for the grouping are casted to a tuplesafe array (not really sure what that is) and put into a list as the sole element. Because of that the keys are not enumerated and in_axis is set to false in line 2695 (which should be true i guess).\r\n\r\nRemoving the outer list in line 2640 fixes the here raised problem but i don't know if it is there for a good reason.\r\n\r\nHope that helps."
