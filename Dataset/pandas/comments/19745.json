    "body": "I've been meaning to give this a second go for a while, but haven't had time. Clearly, I'm not as experienced as others in this thread regarding the pandas codebase, but maybe someone will find some of my thoughts interesting anyway:\r\n\r\n- If the keywords `path` and `path_or_buf` are going to be aligned, perhaps they should both be changed to `filepath_or_buffer` in order to also align with the `read_csv` method.\r\n- I feel like the cleanest solution would be to\r\n  1) Move the `DataFrame` method to `NDFrame` as-is. This would be backwards compatible, so you do not need any deprecation warnings (or, if `path_or_buf` is changed to `filepath_or_buffer`, the current keyword deprecation decorator could be applied to the new method on `NDFrame`).\r\n  2) Add general purpose decorator(s) to enable deprecation of the order of positional arguments and default value of a keyword argument. The deprecation warning for ordering would trigger if you are using \"enough\" positional arguments for the reordering to have any effect, and the default value warning would trigger if you are not explicitly assigning a value to the affected keyword argument. The decorators might prove useful in other situations.\r\n  3) Implement required changes on `Series` in order to align with the `NDFrame` method, using the new deprecation decorators.\r\n  4) Once the deprecation period is over (so that warnings are no longer displayed, but the `Series` method is fully aligned with the `NDFrame` method), move the `Series` method to `NDFrame`, which would be an internal change that users would not need to know about.\r\n- Alternatively, I feel the quickest solution would be moving everything to `NDFrame` in a single breaking change with a nice whatsnew message and get it over with. However, saving stuff to csv seems like a pretty core functionality — keeping in mind that quite a few users of pandas probably never read the whatsnew or even keep track of which version of pandas they are using, I feel like some kind of deprecation warning is in order.\r\n\r\nIf a decision is made as to how to proceed, I would be happy to lend a hand. Unfortunately, I do not currently have time to go through all the steps for a \"clean\" solution on my own.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Reading through my \"clean\" solution, I have to admit it does not look too clean. Here is an alternative: Move everything to `NDFrame`, but for a limited time, use the `path` and `path_or_buf` keywords to trigger deprecation warnings. Basically, to align with `read_csv` those arguments should be changed to `filepath_or_buffer`, so any user who is supplying `path`, `path_or_buf` or relying on the position of that argument would be suspected of relying on the old method signatures. This way, there will be false positives, but I think that is better than having code break silently."

    "body": "Agreed and added. This solution is not friendly towards users that want to pass positional arguments (other than `path_or_buf`).\r\n\r\nOne possibility would be to combine the decorator approach with the approach of #21896. That way, one could have both the intact signature and a solution which works for users that like to use positional arguments."
