    "body": "If you do `df2.plot(secondary_y='date')` it should work. The issue is that the other columns are non-date so the xlim are automatically set so the minimum is less than 1, which confuses the datetime tick formatter.\n\nI'm just curious, what's the purpose of plotting the date column in your use case?\n"

For example, if I tried to combine the last three lines, it created separate plots, which was a surprise.  I'll go ahead and close this bug.\n\ndf2.ix['2011':,'date'].plot(style='k')\ndf2.ix['2011':,'AA'].plot(secondary_y=True, style='g')\ndf2.ix['2011':,'GE'].plot(secondary_y=True, style='r')\ndf2.ix['2011':,'AAPL'].plot(secondary_y=True, style='b')\n"
