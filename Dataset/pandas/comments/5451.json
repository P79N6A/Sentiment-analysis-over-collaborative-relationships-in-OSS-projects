If you think of DataFrame like a dict, with a dict you can pass (key, value) pairs to update to add an iterable to the dictionary. Seems like if you passed new columns to update, it should add them to the DataFrame (because they are all nan) and existing columns would have the existing NA-filling behavior.\n"
