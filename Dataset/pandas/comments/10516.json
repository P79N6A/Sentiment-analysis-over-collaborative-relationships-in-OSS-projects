The big advantage would be that this would leave all of the existing classes parsed the same; adding something new should be straightforward and minimal changes.\n"

    "body": "I still don't get it.  StataReader is either used as an iterator, or the user calls the read or data methods to obtain some or all of the data as a DataFrame.  StataReader also has some additional methods and attributes like variable_labels whose implementation depends on the file version.  If there were subclasses for different dta versions it seems to me that we would need to monkey patch the subclass methods into the base class (since the caller will obtain an instance of the base class not the correct subclass that matches the data file format).  Also complicating matters is the fact that we have to read partway through the file before we know what the version is.  \n"

We currently byteswap it in this case (inheriting from our dta117 code) but I'm not sure that this is correct.\n\nI don't think Stata runs on any big endian platforms, so the only tests that matter here are \n1.
