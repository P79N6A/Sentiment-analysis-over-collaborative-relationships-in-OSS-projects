Just instead of dispatching to the consolidated numpy array ops, it would be dispatching to the consolidated EA ops.\r\n\r\nThere are a bunch of differences between pandas and numpy arith/comparison ops, most of which are handled in `core.ops`.  In the status quo we still don't have full internal-consistency for how these operations behave.  I think the best way to achieve internal consistency is to have One True Implementation for each of these ops.  This can either be on the Series (option 1 above) or in EA (option 2).  The former is definitely easier to implement short-term, but I think less elegant long-term.\r\n"
