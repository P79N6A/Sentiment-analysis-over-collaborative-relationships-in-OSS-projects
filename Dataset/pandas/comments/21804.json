    "body": "@jdoepfert Thanks for the groundwork on initial PR\r\n@gorbondiga just saw your comment. I was working on this for last 2 days and have fixed it - sorry for not commenting here earlier. If you haven't already started working on it, please let me know whether its OK for me to submit PR? In case I don't hear back by Friday, then I'll submit a PR assuming its fine for me to do so.\r\n@jreback all tests do pass, though `pandas/tests/io/test_clipboard.py` module fails as part of suite - however passes when ran individually (seems unrelated to this bug fix). Have also ran the asvs for algorithms and results are as follows:\r\n```\r\n       before           after         ratio\r\n     [5380fcd4]       [bf0543f1]\r\n+     1.80±0.01ms      2.26±0.02ms     1.25  algorithms.Hashing.time_series_int\r\n-     2.21±0.02ms      1.81±0.01ms     0.82  algorithms.Hashing.time_series_dates\r\n-        2.21±0ms      1.80±0.02ms     0.81  algorithms.Hashing.time_series_float\r\n-        15.9±3ms      11.8±0.09ms     0.74  algorithms.Factorize.time_factorize_float(False)\r\n\r\nSOME BENCHMARKS HAVE CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY.\r\n```"
