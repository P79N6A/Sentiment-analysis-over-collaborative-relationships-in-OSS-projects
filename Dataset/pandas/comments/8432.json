In the new version, there are `iloc` and `loc` for fast indexing, but `loc` is even slower in this case. \n\nMy use case is not so special I think: I have a large df with a time index and I get the `Series` when I look at a specific time period. I have to look at many of the values in the `Series`. To speed things up I now convert the Series to a dict and then do the indexing. Of course the conversion is costly as well. \n"

Not all applications allow vectorization however. \n\nOf course pandas cannot be the best tool for every application but I thought this could be a case where some potential performance is left on the table, i.e. the speed can be improved without sacrificing usability or speed in other areas. \n\nObviously indexing in pandas has been worked on a lot and you know the code. Anyway, thanks for the discussion. \n"
