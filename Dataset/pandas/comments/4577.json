Also, if that's the code fragment where the segfault occurs then it probably isn't statsmodels, but who knows without a run of `gdb`. Also, can you run `ci/print_versions.py` (from the top-level `pandas` directory). It will give us an idea of your system as well as all the versions of libraries related to `pandas` that you have installed. Thanks!\n"
