    "body": "Sure, it's definitely more difficult to debug without the data. I'll keep trying to winnow it down, but at some point, it seems should it should be feasible for someone familiar with the codebase to diagnose the issue given the symptoms.\r\n\r\nMore details:  `engine=python` does not have the problem, while `engine=c` does. Some behavior:\r\n```\r\n>>>  pd.read_csv('test23.csv', skiprows=0, engine='python').dtypes[1]\r\ndtype('uint64')\r\n>>>  pd.read_csv('test23.csv', skiprows=0, engine='c').dtypes[1]\r\ndtype('float64')\r\n>>>  pd.read_csv('test23.csv', skiprows=1, engine='c').dtypes[1]\r\ndtype('uint64')\r\n```\r\nThis seems to implicate the first row. But if I go and delete a *random* row from the middle of the file, then the bad behavior goes away. Similarly, if I delete the last row (which happens to be the only row that has a value that is greater than 2**63), then the problem goes away too (expectedly, the inferred dtype is int64 instead of uint64).\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is nothing special about the first row from what I can see.  It is similar to the second row in that the number is smaller than `2**53` and clearly an integer (no decimal digits, as with the entire file). The last row is the only row in the file that is greater than `2**63`, which forces uint64.  Of course, if you go out and construct such a file with these characteristics, you probably won't see the issue."
