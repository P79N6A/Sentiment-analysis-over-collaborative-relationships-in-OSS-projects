    "body": "Examples (more context in my [SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39321914/unpredictable-pandas-slice-assignment-behavior-with-no-settingwithcopywarning)):\n\n```\nimport pandas as pd\ndata = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': ['a', 'b', 'c']})\nnew_data = data[['a', 'b']]\ndata = data['a']\nnew_data.loc[0, 'a'] = 100 # no warning, doesn't propagate to data\nassert data[0] == 1\n\ndata = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': ['a', 'b', 'c']})\nnew_data = data['a']\ndata = data['a']\nnew_data.loc[0] = 100 # no warning, propagates to data\nassert data[0] == 100\n\ndata = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': ['a', 'b', 'c']})\ndata = data.groupby('a')\nnew_data = data.filter(lambda g: len(g)==1)\nnew_data.loc[0, 'a'] = 100 # no warning, does not propagate to data\nassert data.filter(lambda g: True).loc[0, 'a'] == 1\n\n```\n\nEdit to my original post: I think it would also be useful to have a method, say `unlink()`, that explicitly breaks the link between a DataFrame slice and its parent DataFrame. It's not the same as `copy()` because `copy()` always copies, while `unlink()` would be a no-op if the slice happens to already lose its link to the parent (e.g., due to the dtypes combination, in-memory arrangement, etc., or because it or or `copy()` was already called earlier).\n"

You may find some of the components useful if you decide to try and get something in before 2.0. \n"
