The reason I was investigating this is because this warning is still getting thrown out when using the ThreadPoolExecutor to do this calculation (concurrent.futures), as:\n\n```\n/projects/anaconda3/lib/python3.5/site-packages/pandas/core/ops.py:716: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in less\n  result = getattr(x, name)(y)\n```\n\nI do believe the numbers are coming out as expected (I haven't checked meticulously), but did not want to suppress this warning without at least checking where it's coming from.\n"
