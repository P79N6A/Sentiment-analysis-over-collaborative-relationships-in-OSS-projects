If I repeat the same conda procedure but change it to 0.14, the behavior changes.\n\nPrior to 0.14, I had never needed to separately install xlrd for any version. Even when managing my own environments and not using conda. \n\nIs there a way to verify whether I am just crazy? Was xlrd not included with pandas in previous versions? This behavior is certainly new for me in this version.\n"
