    "body": "Thanks for the quick reply. I was hoping for a solution that uses my current environment but that is okay. I made an environment with pandas 0.12 and I was able to load the pickled DataFrame with `cPickle.load`. Note: using `pd.read_pickle` did not work to load the pickled file for my case when using pandas 0.12. I guess the easiest thing to do to use the data in the newer versions of pandas is to save the DataFrame in a format that can be read by the newer version such as a json. Thanks a lot for the help, I should be good now."

    "body": "@pfigliozzi yeah, as I said, since pickles are opaque it is a bit hard to figure out what is wrong if the current tools don't work (that is in general why they are also not a good solution for long term storage). Yep, export as csv usually works (though it lacks the dtype info and is not 100% round-tripable), but pretty good, esp since you are reading in to a newer version of pandas."
