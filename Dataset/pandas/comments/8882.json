    "body": "Indeed, it mostly just takes a little bit of testing work. Glad to see this being done!\n\nFor what it's worth, I looked into releasing the GIL a little bit in the hashtable/index API as part of my IntervalIndex work (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/8707). The main stumbling block I encountered was `pandas.hashtable.Int64Vector` (and the other `Vector` objects). Hopefully someone more clever than me could figure out how to release the GIL on the `append` method by moving the `resize` call to use the C API: https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/0aceb38ac1a4659ae298d726bc447b97943163dc/pandas/hashtable.pyx#L68\n"
