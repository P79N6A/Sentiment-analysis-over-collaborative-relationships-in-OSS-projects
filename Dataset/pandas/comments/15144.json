    "body": "So this is in fact a point of discussion for the API (and not a bug <em>per se</em>):\r\n\r\nWhen should `na_values` be applied?\r\n\r\nCurrently, as evidenced by the code (and personal testing) they are applied after the converters are applied.  This is why there are no `NaN` values because post-conversion, there are no more `NaN` values technically.\r\n\r\nI don't see the harm in choosing one or the other, but we just need agreement and consistency (we have the latter currently).  Regardless of how this issue goes, documentation updates will be needed to explain when `na_values` are applied and to give an example in `io.rst`"
