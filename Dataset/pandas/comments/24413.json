    "body": "Sounds good.  Worth noting that this is would be identical to the signature for [`numpy.repeat`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.repeat.html), which makes sense to match.  Was a little confused as to why we were using `*args` and `**kwargs`, but went with it since it was the existing convention.  Can get to this in the next couple days."
