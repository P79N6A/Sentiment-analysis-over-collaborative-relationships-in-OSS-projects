    "body": "a bug caused by the indexer overflowing the smaller dtypes. fixed in #9077. This only had one test.\n\nThat said, the `drop_duplicates/duplicated` methods exist on Index objects (also as of 0.15.0.)\nAnother way to do this is `idx.duplicated().any()` which in this case is faster, though it depends on the length of the index versus the level depth. \n"
