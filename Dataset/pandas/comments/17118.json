Using the \"#\" is ambiguous.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the reason why I use \"gh-\" is because it receives special parsing from GitHub so that you can navigate to the actual issue / PR *directly*, which doesn't happen with \"GH.\"  The special parsing also happens when you use \"#\".\r\n\r\nI thus find \"gh-\" to be the best of both worlds in terms of clarity and special parsing ðŸ˜„ "
