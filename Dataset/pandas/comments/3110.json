Merging this opens the door to\nall sorts of issues which we can't fully anticipate and which we'll have to implement\nworkarounds for (if found) since we won't be able to remove it once it's in. and those\nworkaround might become ugly. it's similar to the metadata discussion that happend a couple \nof months ago.\n\nIn that sense, the global aliases are actually a cleaner concept, because they really \nare just aliases, not a piece of data tied to a particular object which might mutate\nin the future.\n"
