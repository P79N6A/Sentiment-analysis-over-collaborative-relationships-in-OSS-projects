    "body": "I think we should also consider in looking into `asv` (airspeed velocity), if it would be possible to replace our current vbench suite to that (issue for that is: #8361).\n\nAirspeed velocity is actively developed and maintained, other projects like scipy did also start using it, and it has some nice extra features (eg memory benchmarking, interactive web frontend). So maybe it is more worth the effort looking into that, than trying to improve vbench.\n\nApparently @qwhelan did already some work on this: https://github.com/spacetelescope/asv/issues/194 \n@qwhelan, maybe you can share some thoughts about this?\n"

It was a few simple changes on the vbench side and definitely the harder part is going to be getting the benchmarks compatible.  However, this would probably need to be done anyways for `asv` so I figured it was worth proceeding with vbench.  The suite can be run in Python3 now with my vbench changes (note that I didn't do a full test of plotting, but nothing there seemed to stand out as an issue).  \n"
