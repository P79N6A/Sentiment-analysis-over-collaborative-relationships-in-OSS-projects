    "body": "I also think this should be possible, but indeed computing time may be the most important problem. Do you know how long it takes for you to run the full benchmark? \r\n\r\nI don't think creating a separate repo for this is needed. I thought the main reason for dask to have it as a separate repo was to also include distributed benchmarks (so benchmarks not related to a single package), https://github.com/dask/dask/pull/1738. The advantage of easily including benchmarks with PRs is something we want to keep IMO. They also have a PR for making a cron job: https://github.com/dask/dask-benchmarks/pull/8\r\n\r\nIf we would have an external machine to run perf tests, https://github.com/anderspitman/autobencher could also be interesting (used by scikit-bio)."

    "body": "Re: continuous benchmarking\r\n\r\nIn my experience, you get good enough benchmark stability already from the cheapest dedicated server (~ 100€/year) --- one caveat however is in that these can have crappy CPUs, which behave differently from more high-end models vs some performance benchmarks (e.g. memory bandwidth issues). It's also fairly straightforward to set up a cron job to run (eg. inside a VM / other sandboxing) on your own desktop machine. The results can be easily hosted on github etc., so the machine does not need to be publicly visible.\r\n\r\nThe stability is in practice also less important for the continuous benchmarking over time, and more important for `asv continuous`. The reason is that CPU performance stepping and system loads contributes low-frequency noise (variation on long time scales). This averages towards zero for continuous benchmarking, where benchmark runs are separated by a long time interval --- in contrast, the rapid measurement in `asv continuous` takes samples over a short time interval, and cannot average over the slow noise.\r\n\r\nI don't know a good solution for benchmarking PRs, however. The benchmark suites often take too long to run for Travis, and the results are too unreliable."
