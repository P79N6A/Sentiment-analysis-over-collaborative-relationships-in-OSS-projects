I tried to rename the CSV with the error by adding or removing `_` or `-` in the filenames and re-upload the CSV file. Sometimes it just works that way. I don't know if the mimetype causes the issue."

The SO post is also not particularly useful for us to diagnose any issue.  I am inclined to close this if that's okay."
