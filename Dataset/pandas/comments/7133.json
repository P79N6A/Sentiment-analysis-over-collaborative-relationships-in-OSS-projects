This leaves the decision on whether to optimize up to the std and _count_sqrt methods (which have different rules).\n2. I have also implemented a general test in test_groupby that tests _cython_agg_general for all optimized operations and compares them to an expected result.  It just uses a simple numeric test dataframe, it doesn't test non-numeric data or data with nan values, but to make sure basic operations are working it should be sufficient.\n"

    "body": "I have implemented all the requested changes:\n\n`nanvar` and `nansem` now both use a common private function to get the element count.  I have also implemented unit tests for all the `nan*` functions in `nanops`, including `nanvar` and `nansem`, in a new `test_nanops.py` unit test file.\n\nI have removed `count_sqrt`.  `grouper.sem` is now implemented using `grouper.std` and `grouper.count` directly.  Also, as suggested, I removed `std` from `cython_agg` and implemented `grouper.std` as `sqrt(grouper.var)`.  This also allowed a little simplification of `cython_agg`.  It is private API so I don't know if the change needs to be documented.\n\nI have also updated the docs to refer to 0.14.1 rather than 0.14.0.\n\nAll unit tests are passing now.\n\nThe new unittests not related to `sem` are in their own commits (f5bbd07 and 5771791).  Since they are just additional unittests and don't change any behavior, they could be cherry-picked for 0.14.0.  The `grouper.std` changes are also in their own commit (1b7e239), but that change is probably too invasive for 0.14.0.\n"

    "body": "@toddrjen this PR is doing way too much. you need to break this down into much simpler parts. remove all things associated with object dtype conversions, and Panel and higher dim implementations. They can be done separately and on top of each other. You are introducing way too much logic in nanops that is ONLY for ndarray/scalar types. checking for `apply` is simply nonsense here. This makes it impossible to follow. and their is no separation between functions at all. This is making bugs in the future MUCH MORE LIKELY.\n\nSo in order to accept this you need to split it into parts:\n- 1) sem implm\n- 2) changes for any `inf` handing object dtypes\n- 3) changes for ndim > 2 handing. Need justification for why you are doing this.\n\npls create separate issues for 2 and 3.\n"
