    "body": "How about writing docstrings for internal routines?\r\n\r\nIn my admittedly brief experience, it is hard to know which chunk of code you should be using for whatever particular task. In part this is because `pandas` is such a sprawling library and it takes experience to know where things are, but also in part because IMO there's little internal documentation on the architecture.\r\n\r\nThe `Block` classes are one such thing for me, for example, I'm still not totally sure what they're there for.\r\n\r\nNow I realize that you have to be careful with this because methods change and \"no docstring is better than a wrong docstring\", but I still feel like a little bit more direction would be helpful. ðŸ˜… "
