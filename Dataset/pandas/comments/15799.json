    "body": "Yep, I'm in agreement with @jreback here.  Especially since we can accept callables for both inputs you can emulate `skipcols` and `userows` as follows:\r\n~~~python\r\nskipcols = [...]\r\nuserows = [...]\r\nread_csv(..., usecols=lambda x: x not in skipcols,\r\n              skiprows=lambda x: x not in userows])\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nI think this should resolve your concern about \"clunkiness\" as you put it, so if there are no other concerns, I think this is safe to close."
