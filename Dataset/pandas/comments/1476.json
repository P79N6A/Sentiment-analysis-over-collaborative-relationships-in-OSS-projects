    "body": "Actually this isn't done. What I meant here was, for example, make the next day's open immediately after today' close.\n\nWe could:\n1. Use positional integer index values instead of the period ordinals on the x-axis and then map to the dates in the Index. Though I haven't thought about how to cleanly map x-axis values outside of the Index.\n2. Create custom \"business hours\" frequencies, but there will be too many individualized open/close times.\n3. General parameterized Periods - really hairy\n4. Use Intervals (define 9:00am-4:30pm intervals) - just add an \"is_regular\" to IntervalIndex if all the Intervals are of the same length so can regularize and optimize computations. \n\n@dalejung, you also emailed the mailing list regarding this issue. I'm sorry I didn't get back to you on it. Would you like to continue to discussion here?\n"

    "body": "@changhiskhan I totally didn't see this issue. \n\nI don't see how to do this well without the int index. I think that index needs to be stored somewhere. I do it explicitly in a figure object, but that's probably not necessary. Attaching an index with the proper DateLocator and DateFormatter to a matplotlib object would work. All those objects need to stay around as long as the mpl figure sticks around since the user can resize/zoom. \n\nI also did a quick test with https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/1579 and the int-index does superb for plotting performance. \n"
