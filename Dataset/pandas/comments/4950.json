    "body": "I agree with you. I provided these implementations under the *_pairwise names to fit in with the current API as described on the [Computational Tools](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/computation.html) page.\n\nWhile the behaviour of `rolling_cov` and `rolling_corr` for the `Series/Series` and `DataFrame/Series` seems perfectly fine, the `DataFrame/DataFrame` behaviour doesn't make much sense to me. I can't think of any scenarios where I would want to match on column names and then describe the result as a `rolling_cov` rather than a `rolling_var`. For me a _covariance_ is calculation between two different Series so the name matching doesn't make much sense. The tabular layout of the *_pairwise functions makes it clear which two inputs were used to calculate the covariance or correlation.\n\nHowever I clearly don't know where people are using this so I rather provided these pairwise implementations under different function names in line with the current `rollin_corr_pairwise` API and let you core devs decide how to integrate it into the API.\n"

    "body": "Ok, I've been thinking more about this and think that rather than taking guidance from my own biased preferences, a better approach is to try and minimise cognitive impedance in the API along the lines of the \"Don't make me think\" principle.\n\nNow `DataFrame` already has `cov` and `corr` methods which compute [pairwise covariances](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/computation.html#covariance) and [correlations](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/computation.html#correlation) respectively. Presumably the _raison d'etre_ of the `rolling_*` and `expanding_*` functions is a convenience to the user (to avoid having to loop over the index manually) as well as to take advantage of any performance improvements that might exist in an on-line algorithm over the naive loop implementation. As such it would seem that the `rolling_cov` and `rolling_corr` functions should preserve the API and behaviour of `cov` and `corr` respectively while adding an additional dimension to the result introduced by the _rolling_ operation. Therefore `{rolling|expanding}_cov` and `{rolling|expanding}_corr` should produce `Panels` so that the invariant `expanding_cov(df, ...).ix[-1] == df.cov()` is maintained.\n\nTo deal with the case where the non-pairwise version is desired, I just learned that for `DataFrame` there exists a `corrwith` [method](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/computation.html#correlation) which covers this case. Therefore how about renaming the existing `rolling_corr` function to `rolling_corrwith` and introducing `covwith` as well as `{rolling_|expanding_|ewm}covwith`. Then the `*_pairwise` methods I provided could just become the standard API without the `_pairwise` suffix.\n"

    "body": "@snth It could be hard sell to change the existing functions in the way you describe (since they'd produce different behavior with current defaults). if you couldn't change the existing API (i.e., `pd.rolling_corr(...)` with the current defaults needs to return the same thing as it did in previous versions), are there still ways that you think are simple to make these changes?\n\nIt looks like there already is a `rolling_corr_pairwise` function in the pandas namespace.\n\nThat said, why couldn't we change the signature such that if you only passed one object, it computes the rolling pairwise correlation and otherwise computes the correlation between the two objects.  Shouldn't be that hard to implement. The only quirk would be that you'd have to either change the signature to: `def rolling_corr(arg1, arg2=None, window=None, ...)`. And then if arg2 is None, do the pairwise correlation. It would mean that you'd always have to use keyword arguments for rolling pairwise functions, but I don't think that's such a big deal.\n"

However, there the `center` keyword argument is not sensible (although it is in the function signature, it is also not in the docstring).

In particular if there are missing values in the data then a different number of datapoints will be used in the calculation of different entries of the covariance matrices and these covariance matrices are [not guaranteed to be positive semi-definite](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Estimation_of_covariance_matrices&section=1#Estimation_in_a_general_context).\n\nI just want to point that out as often the availability of something is taken as an implicit guarantee that it is correct, especially by novice users who are not trained in the field. In this case the user is responsible for ensuring that the results are suitable for his or her use-case.\n"
