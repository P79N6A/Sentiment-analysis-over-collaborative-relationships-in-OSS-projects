    "body": "Imho seing this from a perspective of someone who is working with timeseries 24/7, this change of behavior *should be* unintentional.\r\nHaving synchronized axis is covered by `sharex=True`, while the behavior of the `0.23.4` \"un\"shared x-axis currently requires much larger effort to reproduce. Automatically sharing the x-axis of subplots (even though they are not shared in the meaning of setting new limits etc.) is imho not a desired output when working with data.\r\nThus I'd strongly prefer the behavior of version `0.23.4` ."
