    "body": "I believe the `K > 1` would get used sometime, from what I remember some of the aggregations are done by-block, which means a 2d array of multiple columns could get passed down.\r\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/2fdf1e256e5e0b7f1fe909629e2f0b7893c8c7c3/pandas/core/groupby.py#L3736\r\n\r\nIt's probably a micro-micro optimization, but having it split like this may generate slightly better code for `K=1` case.  But welcome you to benchmark and if it doesn't matter, clean it up."
