I would say this raising is more important than adding the Series/DataFrame facade. If we don't have a facade, things will fail loudly, which is unfortunate, but if we have a broken facade, things will fail silently!\n"

The point of breaking compat is to change future behavior. breaking changes always have short term pain, but shying away from actual long time needed inconsistencies is MUCH MUCH worse.\n\nTo answer this: of course we have to keep a right balance between avoiding breaking changes and improving pandas. But that is not always very clear what the right balance is, and I could also imagine other parts of pandas that could use some breaking changes, but that we are reluctant about to do because of its impact (not to mention the indexing api ... :-)) \nAnd most API changes we do are not breaking changes (but deprecations), and are most of the time more corner cases (but OK, I work with time series and use resample a lot, so maybe I am a bit biased)\n\nBut, as you now updated to include a deprecation warning or fail with an informative error, it sounds already a lot better to me! (at least there will be no silent failure, that's probably the most important)\n\nMaybe I will ping the mailing list about this, as it is a rather large change?\n"

(I know it is like this for series, but this is new API)\n- repr of the DatetimeIndexResampler: same comment as for the Rolling objects, and I think you changed it there? So would make it consistent.\n- DatetimeIndexResampler has no docstring\n- `transform` does not work with resample (you get a `AbstractMethodError`)\n- More complex aggregations:\n  - Doing `r[['A', 'B']].agg({'result1' : np.sum,'result2' : np.mean})` gives a blank AssertionError, which is not very helpful\n  - Doing `r.agg({'A' : ['sum','std'], 'B' : ['mean','std'] })` works as expected, but `r[['A', 'B']].agg({'A' : ['sum','std'], 'B' : ['mean','std'] })` gives _Exception: Must produce aggregated value_ ?\n- `apply` also gives _Exception: Must produce aggregated value_ if you pass it a function that does not return a aggregated value. For groupby this works, would be nice to have this consistent.\n"

    "body": "I experimented a bit with the branch, some smaller comments:\n- the repr: can we follow here PEP8 as well? :-) (I mean spaces after the comma's, I think this would make it a bit more readable, maybe also quotes around the strings)\n- `upsample` has been removed? (but is still in the documentation) Or is this now `asfreq`?\n- `apply` gives `Exception: Must produce aggregated value` (for a series) if you pass it a function that does not return a aggregated value. For groupby this works, would be nice to have this consistent. \n  When applying it on a resampled dataframe, you get the cryptic `ValueError: cannot copy sequence with size 3 to array axis with dimension 180` message. Typical example is just a `.apply(lambda x: x)`\n\nFurther, there is still a lot of documentation missing. Some examples:\n- `Resampler.fillna` has no explanation\n- `DatetimeIndexResampler` has no docstring yet\n- `apply`, `agg`, `aggregate` have no docstring, `transform` a very brief\n\nIn theory it would be best if this were addressed in this PR, but given the PEP8 changes waiting on this PR, it's OK for me to leave this for a follow-up PR\n"
