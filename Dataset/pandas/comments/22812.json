    "body": "Just about the name:\r\n\r\nOne disadvantage of this name: not being native speaking, and not coming from a database background, I would not even have the slightest idea what even the word itself would mean, let alone what it would do. \r\n\r\nI know it is a term used in SQL (and which is a big plus for using such a name), and in the meantime I know it from there, but IMO it is a rather newcomer unfriendly name. In that sense, I find 'combine' or 'update' more natural terminology.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThen about the functionality: I think a `coalesce` method would need to be rather like a `combine_first` than as a `update`, in terms of default `overwrite` behaviour (which might not be what you want?), since the SQL coalesce is about the first non-missing value.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n(sidenote in general: sorry for the slow progress at the moment in those discussions, it seems there are currently not many other core devs that have time to participate, and such discussions take time / need input of other people. That can certainly be annoying, but is part of the open source process ..)"

    "body": "@jorisvandenbossche \r\n\r\nThanks for the response! I understand that dev time is a very limited resource... ;-)\r\n\r\nI don't feel strongly about the name. I'd be fine with having it under `update` (which some people strongly oppose to being not inplace; hence this issue), and I'd be fine with having it as `coalesce` (which has the SQL background; though you're right that the default for `overwrite` should then be False).\r\n\r\nI'd also be fine with naming it something shorter (and less specific than `update/coalesce/combine_first`), like `fuse`, which - in terms of language difficulty - should be IMO on par with `melt/pivot/merge`, and would avoid clashing with people's pre-conceived notions about what capabilities the name implies (inplace/overwrite/join-style etc.). It's also nice and short to type.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dictionary.com/browse/fuse:\r\n[...]\r\n**verb (used with object), fused, fus·ing**.\r\n2. to combine or blend by melting together; melt.\r\n3. to unite or blend into a whole, as if by melting together:\r\n> The author skillfully fuses these ~~fragments~~ DataFrames into a cohesive whole.\r\n\r\n**verb (used without object), fused, fus·ing**.\r\n[...]\r\n5. to become united or blended:\r\n> The two ~~groups~~ DataFrames fused to create one strong union.\r\n\r\nIn any case, my main point is about having the desired capabilities, not about a specific name."

    "body": "@wesm \r\nThanks for taking the time to answer.\r\n\r\nThe pre-existing name is a strong argument for sure. While I care much more about the functionality than what name it resides under, I also see the appeal of not having the baggage of preconceptions that come with the name (e.g. `coalesce` does not have a notion of a join/overwrite in SQL land, or `update` being inplace, etc.)\r\n\r\nThis could look as follows in a putative docstring:\r\n```python\r\n    def fuse(self, other, join='left', overwrite=True, filter_func=None,\r\n             errors='ignore'):\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        Unite two DataFrames into one, filling non-NA values where possible.\r\n\r\n        This method always aligns on index and columns. The parameters easily\r\n        allow switching between different usage patterns, which sometimes have\r\n        dedicated methods in other languages (or previous versions of pandas):\r\n\r\n        * `update` (e.g. for python-dict):\r\n            same result as `df.fuse(other)`, but `fuse` is not inplace.\r\n        * `coalesce` (SQL):\r\n            equivalent (entry-by-entry) to `df.fuse(other, overwrite=False)`.\r\n        * `combine_first` (pandas before version 1.0):\r\n            `df.combine_first(other)` is equivalent to\r\n            `df.fuse(other, join='outer', overwrite=False) or\r\n            `other.fuse(df, join='outer')`.\r\n\r\n        Two additional keywords allow further tuning of the behavior, e.g. to\r\n        raise if non-NA values coincide.\r\n\r\n        Parameters\r\n        ----------\r\n        other : DataFrame, or object coercible into a DataFrame\r\n            [rest is the same as for df.update (but with more joins)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat being said, I'd be just as happy with `coalesce`.\r\n"
