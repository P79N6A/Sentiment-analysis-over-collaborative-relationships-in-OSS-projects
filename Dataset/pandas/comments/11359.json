    "body": "The strict ordering of fields is by design (also in 0.16.2). From the [docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html#io-bigquery-writer):\n\n```\nThe dataframe must match the destination table in column order, structure, and data types.\n```\n\n> because apparently GBQ is not consistent in the order of fields in the schema (or my application screws the order of fields up\n\nCan you confirm whether it is your application that is changing the order of fields? If we can understand how the ordering of fields is changing, we may be better off fixing that problem instead.\n\nMy personal preference would be to fail if the column order of the DataFrame being inserted is different. It is trivial to alter the column order of a DataFrame prior to inserting. \n\nCertainly, the proposed changed would be more flexible, but I think that the user should be aware of the column order, in case the BigQuery table schema has actually changed.\n"

    "body": "Thanks for your answer. Wasn't reading the docs closely enough apparently. It's very likely that it is my application as I am transforming raw JSON from the Twitter API to a dataframe and the order there is arbitrary. I can try to verify that though. But order of columns seemed (before formatting anything for readable output) pretty unnecessary to me and only costing additional programming time as well as introducing more possibilities for errors to sneak in.\n\nOn the other hand, but now we are talking about particular project requirements and personal preferences, this use case it not that unlikely. And I don't know how the order of fields in BigQuery would matter for most applications of BigQuery in the end, as you query for fields by name anyway. For my project it's just another step processing the data (which will come in large volume) before inserting, and I need to minimise those. Have to admit that ordering is trivial, indeed. So yes, that's a design decision. I would plead for a less strict option (maybe with an optional argument in to_gbq?) though.\n"
