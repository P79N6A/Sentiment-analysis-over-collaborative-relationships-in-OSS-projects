    "body": "> I think categorical actually means something, you DO want to propogate it. (or at least we do in some situations).\n\nI'm firmly in that camp: if I have categoricals and some of them are not used, I want counts for that category show up as \"0\". So from my perspective https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/12298 works as intended and I would reject this premise (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/12298#issuecomment-183136443) and the row should not be dropped:\n\n> if we accept the premise that we don't want to always represent categorical results (IOW we treat them like regular results), then a filtered row should be dropped.\n\nThe only exception I can think of is if there is any way to distinguish between a empty categorical because of the filter and simply a not used category in the original data. But I don't think this is possible.\n"
