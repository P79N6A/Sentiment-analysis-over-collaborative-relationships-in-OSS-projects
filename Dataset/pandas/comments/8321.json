    "body": "I know the [numpy docs](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.classes.html) _say_ that these methods are for ndarray subclasses, but my experience writing a handful of ndarray-like objects (non-subclasses) is that numpy checks for these attributes (duck typing) instead of checking for actual ndarray subclasses. I would consider this a documentation bug for numpy.\n\n`__array_interface__` appears to be design for low-level inoperability with numpy.ndarrays, and, as [the docs say](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/arrays.interface.html) appears to be largely supplanted by the [revised buffer protocol](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3118/).\n\nSo, roughly speaking, these are two different ndarray interfaces that serve different needs. Are you need/want to be checking for the later? Maybe you could describe what exactly you are trying to do with this? :)\n"

    "body": "@shoyer +1 on the numpy docs being buggy! Yeah, looking through the numpy code it looks like checks for array-likeness in one big function through a series of `if` statements. I can use `__array_interface__` with `__array_wrap__` and everything is fine. I should've linked the original issue #8311. \n\nI put the check above our big `if` block since `DataFrame` has explicit handling for `ndarray`. If it was just a no-op like in `Series` I would've just put it in the `else`. If I put it in the `DataFrame` else, I'd have to copypasta replicate the `np.ndarray` handling. \n"
