    "body": "Right. The issue is floating point imprecision when a float index is used. \n\n```\n>>> xs = arange(0, 1, 0.1)\n>>> ys = cos(xs)\n>>> df = DataFrame({'x': xs, 'y': ys})\n>>> df2 = df.set_index('x')\n>>> df3 = df.reindex(arange(0, 1, 0.01))\n>>> df3.index[30] == df['x'][3]\nFalse\n>>> print df3.index[30], df['x'][3]\n0.3 0.3\n>>> df3.index[30]\n0.29999999999999999\n>>> df['x'][3]\n0.30000000000000004\n```\n\nIn and of itself, this is fine. I'm not the first person to be bitten by floating point imprecision and I won't be the last. The issue _might_ be closed as a PEBKAC error.\n\n**However**, pandas actively encourages you to use the `set_index()`, `reindex()`, `interpolate()`, `rename()` pattern. That this may not work for floats is a big drawback (who wants to interpolate ints? ints are boring) and at the very least should be mentioned in the documentation for `DataFrame.interpolate()` and `Series.interpolate()`. \n\nAlternatively, `DataFrame.interpolate()` should take a column name to interpolate by, instead of using the index. I'm happy to write such a method and submit a patch, if it has any chance of being accepted.\n"

The only way we could ensure that\n\n```\ndf.interpolate(x='x', new_x=some_iterable) == df.set_index('x').interpolate()\n```\n\nis if we ensure that Float64Index checks for \"close\" values in the original index and coerces the new index values to those. On the one hand, this seems perfectly reasonable and would prevent people getting bitten. On the other hand, this may break existing code. The new behaviour could be optional of course by adding a `corce_index=True` or similar argument to the Float64Index constructor/`__init__()`.\n\nAgain, I'm quite happy to work on a patch for this, provided you and/or the other maintainers feel that this is the way to go.\n"
