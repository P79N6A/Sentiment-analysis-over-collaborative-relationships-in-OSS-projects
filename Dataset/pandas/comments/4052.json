    "body": "I've spent some time on this in the past. These are my thoughts:\n\n1) Reverse engineering the binary data set format is a difficult task and not a good priority for this project. Any solution, like the R solution, that doesn't deal with compressed data sets won't do me any good. I can't speak for others on that. I also worry about the licensing issues.\n2) Given that, the only option for read_sas may be to use the sas executable to first export SAS to a format that can be read by Python.\n3) The SAS transport format, as described in the tech note, is an option but it has some quirks. In particular, the native XPORT engine doesn't handle long variable names. It really hasn't evolved since SAS 6 (we're on SAS 9 now). The SAS workaround for long variable names is a set of macros that not everyone has installed. \n4) I'm not convinced the XPORT format is a better option than just CSV. If it's dramatically faster it might be. I'll study that next week.\n5) If the mechanism for reading SAS data sets turns out to be export to CSV and then using read_csv, then there's not much code to write that isn't SAS environment dependent. It just doesn't make for a good shared module.\n\nAs much as I wish there was a good solution to this, and as much as I'd be willing to help build it, I just don't think there is. I've built read_sas using CSV as an intermediate format. Obviously, this requires a SAS license. It takes very few lines to implement, but most of those lines are specific to our SAS environment and are not well-portable.\n\nI will study the performance of XPORT vs CSV next week. If it's dramatically faster, then it may be worth the effort to implement. Even then, I'm not sure it's worth taking that on as part of the Pandas project. I would be interested in comments from other SAS users on that.\n\nJust my two cents.\n"
