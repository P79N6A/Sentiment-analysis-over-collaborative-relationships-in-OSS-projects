If we were to use pyopenxl for the writing, then i think it would be good to make sure we can also read .xlsx files with ExcelFile.  I propose we either ditch xlrd from ExcelFile and switch to pyopenxl, or I can try to support both (based on the file extension or something like that).  Thoughts?\n"
