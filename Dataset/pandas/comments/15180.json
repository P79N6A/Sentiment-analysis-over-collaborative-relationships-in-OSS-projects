    "body": "Thanks for the report and detailed example - this is a duplicate of #11733.  I'm entirely in favor of supporting this, though it is tricky to handle all the various formats and not break back-compat.\r\n\r\nOne idea I'm not sure I had explored - right now the default for `index_col` is `None`, so passing `index_col=None` can't give any information.  We possibly could change the default to `'infer'` (since that is what is really happening) - so that passing `index_col=None` is meaningful.  PRs / additional ideas welcome!\r\n\r\n "
