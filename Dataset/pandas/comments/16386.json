    "body": "> I haven't written any new slice_locs tests, mostly because I'm not sure what this is testing on the index / am generally confused about slicing.\r\n\r\n`slice_locs` is used for label based indexing with slices. Basically, `series.loc[start:stop]` gets implemented as something like `series.iloc[series.index.slice_locs(start, stop)`. (Don't worry about `step`, it's only allowed to be an integer and doesn't really effect how this works.)\r\n\r\nTo gain some intuition for how this should work, I recommend trying indexing a series with integer labels, e.g., `s = pd.Series(range(5))` with various integer and float bounds. Also try with out of order `index=[3, 4, 0, 1, 2]`, duplicate `index=[0, 0, 1, 1, 2]` or decreasing `index=reversed(range(5))` indexes.\r\n\r\nI think `IntervalIndex` handles slicing consistently with `Int64Index`, but I haven't tested it much recently.\r\n\r\nGenerally, I like the way this is coming together -- these test cases will be super helpful! See inline comments below."

I fixed some stuff up, I think it's mostly ready for another look.\r\n\r\nI'm particularly interested in hearing: \r\n- should tests be moved? \r\n- should tests be split? \r\n- should some tests be reduced because their functionality is already being tested elsewhere (e.g. overlaps & covers deferring to get_loc)\r\n- Are some tests missing? In particular some of the integration tests in indexing might need new equivalents under the \"updated\" regime, but I'm not totally sure. \r\n\r\nFinally, I think (but am not totally sure) I need to take a long look at `slice_locs` and write some tests for that. I'll take a look at that later today. "

(I already don't remember from the tests)\r\n  - indexing with a list\r\n    - ...\r\n- ..."

    "body": "Okay, so as @shoyer [mentioned above](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/16386#issuecomment-302942312), the bottom methods are  `.get_loc()`, `.slice_locs()` and `.get_indexer()` and so we should at least update the functionality for those three. \r\n\r\nRight now, I think that `.get_loc()` is in a good place, but `.slice_locs()` and `.get_indexer()` are not super well defined. \r\n\r\n### `get_indexer`\r\n\r\nWhat should we do in each of the following situations: \r\n\r\n```\r\nIntervalIndex.get_indexer(int/float)\r\nIntervalIndex.get_indexer(list of ints/floats)\r\nIntervalIndex.get_indexer(Interval)\r\nIntervalIndex.get_indexer(list of Interval)\r\nIntervalIndex.get_indexer(IntervalIndex)\r\nIntervalIndex.get_indexer(list of IntervalIndex)\r\n```\r\n\r\n@jorisvandenbossche already mostly answers [above](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/16386#discussion_r122749593) \r\n\r\n### `slice_locs`\r\n\r\n[My comment above about `.slice_locs()` hasn't been answered yet. ](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/16386#issuecomment-306800091)\r\n\r\nWhat should we do in each of the following situations: \r\n\r\n```\r\nIntervalIndex.slice_locs(int/float:int/float)\r\nIntervalIndex.slice_locs(int/float:)\r\nIntervalIndex.slice_locs(:int/float)\r\n\r\nIntervalIndex.slice_locs(list of ints/floats pairs)\r\n\r\nIntervalIndex.slice_locs(Interval:Interval)\r\nIntervalIndex.slice_locs(Interval:)\r\nIntervalIndex.slice_locs(:Interval)\r\n\r\nIntervalIndex.slice_locs(list of Interval pairs)\r\n\r\nIntervalIndex.slice_locs(IntervalIndex)\r\nIntervalIndex.slice_locs(list of IntervalIndex)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome of those can probably throw \"that doesn't make any sense\" errors, but I'm not sure what the seemingly valid ones should do. @jorisvandenbossche @jreback \r\n"
