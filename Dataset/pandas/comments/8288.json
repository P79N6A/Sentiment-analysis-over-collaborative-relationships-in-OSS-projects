    "body": "...ended up having more time this evening. I reviewed the Travis build. Found a problem I need guidance on, and of course a couple other finer details to touch up.\n\nSo...I'll put these note below, but really they apply to another PR coming soon.\n\n# Unresolved, but with work around.\n\n## ExpandingApply\n\nThe travis build didn't render the results from the expandingapply the same as my machine.  Need advice on this. I pulled, rebuilt, and used 0.15.0rc to render, and it still didn't render the same as the travis build.  Any ideas?\n\nFor now, I just took the results, and hardcoded it.  So, to the reader, this issue is resolved.\n\n### My Build\n\n![expandingapply](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6062071/4600777/bb5549ba-50dc-11e4-8ab2-decc533832db.png)\n\n### Travis Build\n\n![expandingapply problem](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6062071/4600786/14156800-50dd-11e4-85fb-c4c47b4fe163.png)\n\n# Resolved\n\n## Extra AllCrit;\n\nNoticed that there were two cases of \"AllCrit_;_\", and I only deleted the one you guys pointed to.  Resolved by deleting the second one.\n\n## Missing Render of line 565 - 569\n\nFor some reason sphinx didn't render three key lines.  I solved it by changing the structure of the function and re-typing it. I think sphinx got confused by the double indent on the final 'return', or I had a tab somewhere.\n\n## Missing Render of line 659 - 662\n\nIt did it here too.  I resolved by creating a second notebook break and shrugged my shoulders.\n\n## Spaces and Tabs\n\nIt appears that I, and the previous authors, were sloppy with tabs/spaces.  I replaced all with spaces.\n"
