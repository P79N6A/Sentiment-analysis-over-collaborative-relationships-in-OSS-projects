    "body": "Here's what I got from ASV after removing those properties. Note that there is no nanoseconds property in CPython's source, so that will need to remain here for the time being\r\n\r\n       before         after       ratio\r\n       215±4ns        167±4ns     0.78  timedelta.TimedeltaProperties.time_timedelta_days\r\n       212±4ns        155±2ns     0.73  timedelta.TimedeltaProperties.time_timedelta_microseconds\r\n       210±3ns        149±3ns     0.71  timedelta.TimedeltaProperties.time_timedelta_seconds\r\n\r\nFrom a few runs it looks like me like savings could be 20-25%. You've called out before that this will make our docstrings inconsistent and it is a little clunky since nanoseconds would still be around. On the flip side, it is less code for pandas and gives a slight performance boost. Worth a PR?"
