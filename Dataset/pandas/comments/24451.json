    "body": "So there are two issues:\r\n\r\n* The main page `/api.html` no longer exists, as it is now `/api/index.html` (on stable docs: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html, check http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/api.html vs http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/api/index.html)\r\n  * I am wondering if there is no way for sphinx to keep `api.html` working if `/api/` is a directory instead of a file?\r\n  * Otherwise a redirect from api.html to api/index.html would not be hard to add\r\n* The generated pages changed url from `/generated/method_name.html` to `/api/generated/method_name.html` (eg http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/generated/pandas.read_csv.html -> http://pandas-docs.github.io/pandas-docs-travis/api/generated/pandas.read_csv.html)\r\n  * Is it needed to make this change? @datapythonista was there a technical reason that it needs to be in `/api/generated`, and not in `/generated`. In the PR you mentioned some problems with autosummary related to this?\r\n\r\n> The pandas API reference page is huge. Which makes it difficult for users to find information\r\n\r\nThis depends a bit on how the page is used. I personally use it for finding (the docstring page of) a certain function/method typically with ctrl-f. Having it split over many pages makes this actually harder .. (although I am probably an atypical user of the page)."
