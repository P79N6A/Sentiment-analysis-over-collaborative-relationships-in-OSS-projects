If you can provide something reproducible and *minimal* then someone on the team could review in more detail; please see the contributing guide on how to do that:\r\n\r\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/contributing.html#bug-reports-and-enhancement-requests\r\n\r\nI'll take a stab in the dark and say that the formatting of your cells in Excel may impact the representation of the cell values, but again that's just a guess. If you can provide a reproducible example as outlined above feel free to reopen"
