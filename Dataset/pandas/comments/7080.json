    "body": "in numpy >= 1.8.0 numpy started passing additional kwargs to the called function (e.g. for the primitives min,max,sum, etc) if the called object supported it (e.g. series))\n\nmeaning\n\n`np.sum(s)` ends up calling `s.sum(**kwargs)` (which is actually a good thing)\n\npandas 0.12. didn't handle this and would complain if numpy passed additional args. \n\nnumpy 1.8.0 came out in oct 2013; pandas 0.12 in july 2013. at the time we didn't have tests for this so wasn't caught.\n\nThis is fixed in 0.13.0 (0.13.1) is the current, and 0.14 coming shortly.\n\nhere was the original issue: https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/4435\n"
