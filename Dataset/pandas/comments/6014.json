In the typical case they are positive, and it makes it a lot easier for people to match segments to labels if they follow the same order in the 'top to bottom' sense (i.e the visually intuitive sense), not the 'first to last' sense.\n\nI'm new to issue reporting on github and so I don't know the etiquette for these things, but I'm curious if we can get someone else's opinion on this.\n"

    "body": "Hi all, \nI probably shouldn't have used 'A, B, C' as my example because those already have a well defined ordering. Where this really matters is when you have categorical variables without a well-defined ordering. Here is default behavior in pandas. I think this is hard to read.\n![screen shot 2014-01-26 at 11 17 33 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/831341/2006654/71fa8074-8723-11e3-811f-1489a645c675.png)\n\nHere is the default behavior in Excel, which I think is much easier to read. I also like how Excel preserves the order of the categories rather than sorting alphabetically.\n![screen shot 2014-01-26 at 11 06 07 pm](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/831341/2006656/8691aada-8723-11e3-968d-bb8081a6cbe9.png)\n\nI personally think the Excel-style visually-matching ordering should be the default, but if that's not possible do you think there could be a simple \"reverse labels\" option in the plot method, or some other simple way to accomplish this? Thanks. \n\nP.S, I don't have Tableau, but I did a google image search, and it looks like the segments and labels are sorted in the same way visually, as in Excel.\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=tableau+stacked+bar+graph&tbm=isch\n"
