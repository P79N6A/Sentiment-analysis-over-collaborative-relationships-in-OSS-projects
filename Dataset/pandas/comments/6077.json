    "body": "Any thoughts on requirements/wishes with respect to backwards compatibility or easy transition to a new interface from the perspective of pandas users?\n\nFrom what I remember when I looked at this years ago, I don't know how much has changed:\n\nOLS is just a moving/expanding wrapper, where we only need to have the slicing code additionally to what statsmodels already has.\n\nPLM is fixed effects panel data, adding the fixed effect dummies is quite easy, but we have the within estimator in the panel PR that demeans and avoids the explicit fixed effect dummies. panel hac robust standard errors are available but are not the default and have most likely different degrees of freedom correction. ( I never compared.) And interface to robust standard errors in statsmodels is still not convenient enough.\n\nVAR in pandas: I don't know anything about that. From a quick look it needs a check to see what is different or whether there are any differences to the statsmodels version.\n\nI never managed to figure out fama_macbeth in pandas (and I don't really know what it's supposed to do). Test coverage, last time I looked, might have been non-existing. From a quick look at the source, there are still only a few smoke tests.\n\nSo it looks to me that fama_macbeth needs verifying unit tests before we would merge it into statsmodels. The rest is mainly the wrapping around existing verified statsmodels code.\n"

    "body": "I hope you guys don't mind this note of interjection. I noticed the following:\n\n<blockquote>I never managed to figure out fama_macbeth in pandas (and I don't really know what it's supposed to do). </blockquote>\n\nI use pandas and I use Fama-MacBeth so I thought I could shed some light. Fama-MacBeth is still a well used econometric method in academic finance (less so than it was 10  years ago but still pretty common). It's most common on the asset pricing research side of things. It's a cross-sectional regression method that is meant to handle specifications where there is cross-correlation among the entities (usually stocks). The closest analog to Fama-MacBeth is a pooled regression with time fixed effects and standard errors adjusted for clustering on time as well (they are not the same econometrically but they tend to give similar results and are meant to overcome similar problems with the data).\n\nHere is a typical case. A panel with all US stocks over time (say monthly 1963:07 - 2013:03):\n\n```\n                      ret     logme     logbm\ncaldt      permno\n1987-07-01 10001   2.1277  1.761665  0.014313\n1987-08-01 10001   8.3333  1.782719  0.014313\n1987-09-01 10001  -2.2308  1.862761  0.014313\n1987-10-01 10001   2.0000  1.824549  0.014313\n1987-11-01 10001  -2.9412  1.844352  0.014313\n...\n                       ret     logme     logbm\ncaldt      permno\n2012-11-01 93436   20.2215  8.071144 -2.590342\n2012-12-01 93436    0.1478  8.255310 -2.590342\n2013-01-01 93436   10.7470  8.260604 -2.590342\n2013-02-01 93436   -7.1448  8.362681 -2.590342\n2013-03-01 93436    8.7855  8.288553 -2.590342\n```\n\n I want to look at cross-section relation between future returns and market-cap and book-to-market (pretty close to what Fama and French did in 1992):\n\nr_{i,t+1) = a + b1_log(mcap_{it}) + b2_log(BM_{it}) + e_{it},  \n\nIf I estimate with Fama-MacBeth, there are two stages:\n1. I estimate a cross-sectional regression (of the above) every month (for every t). So there are a, b1, and b2 estimates for each month (in this case 597 months). So there is a time series of estimates.\n2. I then takes the average of the time series of the estimated coefficients  from stage 1. The standard errors and t-stats are computed based on the time series of the estimated coefficients. This is what is computed in the Fama-MacBeth output produced by pandas. In this example it is the following:\n\n```\n print pd.fama_macbeth(y=stk.ret,x=stk.ix[:,['logme','logbm']])\n\n----------------------Summary of Fama-MacBeth Analysis-------------------------\n\nFormula: Y ~ logme + logbm + intercept\n# betas : 597\n\n----------------------Summary of Estimated Coefficients------------------------\n     Variable          Beta       Std Err        t-stat       CI 2.5%      CI 97.5%\n      (logme)       -0.1652        0.0449         -3.68       -0.2533       -0.0772\n      (logbm)        0.2927        0.0674          4.34        0.1606        0.4248\n  (intercept)        2.1204        0.3603          5.89        1.4143        2.8265\n\n--------------------------------End of Summary---------------------------------\n\n```\n\nHere is comparison with a monthly pooled regressions with month fixed effects and standard errors clustered by month:\n\n```\n. areg ret logme logbm, absorb(caldt) cluster(caldt)\n\nLinear regression, absorbing indicators           Number of obs   =    2214354\n                                                  F(   2,    596) =      27.96\n                                                  Prob > F        =     0.0000\n                                                  R-squared       =     0.1098\n                                                  Adj R-squared   =     0.1096\n                                                  Root MSE        =    16.8355\n\n                                (Std.

    "body": "@kdiether Thanks that's useful\nGiven that you mention cluster robust standard errors, I remember that \nMitchell A. Petersen: Estimating Standard Errors in Finance Panel Data Sets: Comparing Approaches\nhttp://rfs.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/1/435.short\ndescribed it. But I mostly skipped Fama-MacBeth when I wrote the cluster robust and HAC covariance code.\n\nDo you have an example script for your use of fama_macbeth?\nIf we want to include it in statsmodels we need to see how it works and be able to get unit tests for it.\n\nIf having something close to fama macbeth is enough, than we could just rely on standard panel methods, with fixed effects and similar automatic support for pandas, and we already have cluster robust, two-way cluster robust, panel HAC and Driscoll–Kraay, mostly consistent with Stata available. (Defaults for small sample corrections and degrees of freedom are still a bit of an open question. They are similar but not all the same as Stata's.)\n\n(edited, because I hit enter by accident)\n"

Also, Cochrane's  Asset Pricing book has a discussion of the econometrics of Fama-MacBeth.
