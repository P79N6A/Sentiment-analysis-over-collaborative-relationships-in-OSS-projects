    "body": "@jreback Lots of issues with PeriodIndex & resample. ref: https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/12774 & https://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/12770\n\nI didn't really follow the resample refactor so I don't know the genesis of these. I had a look through the current code but can't find easy fixes. Looks like a lot is reliant on the `kind` attribute, but it's not completely consistent (i.e. a resampled PeriodIndex at times changes `kind` from `period` to `timestamp`, etc).\n\nDo you have any ideas for an overarching strategy for these? \nFor example, should we just convert every `PeriodIndex` to a `DatetimeIndex`, resample it, and then convert back? \n"

    "body": "@MaximilianR I commented on this in #12774 . The logic from < 0.18.0 is exactly the same. The problem is the period is not systematically tested and there are quite a few edge cases. Further compounding this is the `kind` kw, which I think we could just totally eliminate. Now the obstacle is that its often easier to change the DTI to a PI, resample then change it back. The code paths are there, just the `kind` thing really perverts the logic.\n\nSo what we need is a fair amount of systematic testing. Then remove the `kind` (well you don't actually remove it, but deprecate it and we'll remove it later).\n"
