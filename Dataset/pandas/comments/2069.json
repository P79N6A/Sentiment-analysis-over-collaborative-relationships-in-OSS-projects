    "body": "Hey all,\n\nI just started using Pandas a few days ago and ran into a related issue. \n\nBasically I am reading in data from a .csv file. I have been writing some unit tests and was getting some errors because my expected values were different from the ones I calculated in Excel. At first, I assumed it was due to rounding but when I inspected my data frame, I realized that I was getting errors because of floating point issues. Basically, an input price of 7.34 was now 7.3399999999999999 (I am working with stock prices). \n\nI was just wondering what the recommended way of dealing with this is, if any? Should I be converting my data frame to another type once imported?\n\nThanks in advance for your help and great job on this solid library.\n"

    "body": "I detected that read_csv has this bug too.\n\nIt's not a Python format issue. It's not a general floating point issue, despite it's true that floating point arithmetic is a subject which demands some care from the programmer. This article below clarifies a bit this subject:\n\nhttp://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/floatingpoint.html\n\nThe problem is that it's necessary to employ fixed point arithmetic and only convert to floating point in the end, applying a convenient divisor.\n\nA classic one-liner which shows the \"problem\" is ...\n\n> > > 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1\n> > > 0.30000000000000004\n\n... which does not display 0.3 as one would expect. On the other hand, if you handle the calculation using fixed point arithmetic and only in the last step you employ floating point arithmetic, it will work as you expect. See this:\n\n> > > (1 + 1 + 1)  \\* 1.0 / 10\n> > > 0.3\n\nSo, it's necessary to account to the position of the decimal point, ignore it initially and go ahead with the algorithm which converts text to integers (not floats!). The last step consists on converting an integer to a float by dividing by an adequate power of 10.\n\nIf you desperately need to circumvent this problem quickly, I recommend you create another CSV file which contains all figures as integers, for example multiplying by 100, 1000 or other factor which turns out to be convenient. Inside your application, read the CSV file as usual and you will get those integer values back. Then convert those values to floating point, dividing by the same factor you multiplied before.\n"
