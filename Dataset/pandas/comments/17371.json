    "body": "@rizac : Thanks for reporting this!  A couple of things:\r\n\r\n* In the issue template, we recommend that you try upgrading to see if you're issue is still existing in the latest version of `pandas`.  I notice that you are using `0.19.2`, when we are at `0.20.3`.  Would upgrading to the newest version help you out?\r\n\r\n* I run your code with Python 3.x without issues.  You can try importing `unicode_literals` in Python 2.x before running your sample to see if that changes things.\r\n\r\nIf neither works, ping us again, and we can revisit."

    "body": "Thank you @gfyoung \r\n\r\nYes the bug it's still there when upgrading to pandas 0.20.3. But you're right, it does not raise with python3x.\r\n\r\nWith `unicode__literals`, as long as I remember, I coerce python2 strings to be unicode, and if I correctly recall this is not the desired behaviour: I do want some columns to be bytes, and some to be unicode. Moreover, the 'bytes' data are bytes data downloaded from a web service (the example posted is for simplicity), and I do not see how the import should help\r\n\r\nPS: I understand if the problem has not high priority (after all, it works in python3x and we are in 2017). If it will not be reported as a bug I'd like to know in any case if my workaround is the only feasible way or there is a more elegant one.\r\n\r\nThank you again\r\n\r\nNew pd.show_versions() output:\r\n<details>\r\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\r\n------------------\r\ncommit: None\r\npython: 2.7.11.final.0\r\npython-bits: 64\r\nOS: Darwin\r\nOS-release: 15.6.0\r\nmachine: x86_64\r\nprocessor: i386\r\nbyteorder: little\r\nLC_ALL: en_US.UTF-8\r\nLANG: en_US.UTF-8\r\nLOCALE: None.None\r\n\r\npandas: 0.20.3\r\npytest: None\r\npip: 9.0.1\r\nsetuptools: 36.3.0\r\nCython: None\r\nnumpy: 1.13.1\r\nscipy: None\r\nxarray: None\r\nIPython: None\r\nsphinx: None\r\npatsy: None\r\ndateutil: 2.6.1\r\npytz: 2017.2\r\nblosc: None\r\nbottleneck: None\r\ntables: None\r\nnumexpr: None\r\nfeather: None\r\nmatplotlib: None\r\nopenpyxl: None\r\nxlrd: None\r\nxlwt: None\r\nxlsxwriter: None\r\nlxml: None\r\nbs4: None\r\nhtml5lib: None\r\nsqlalchemy: None\r\npymysql: None\r\npsycopg2: None\r\njinja2: None\r\ns3fs: None\r\npandas_gbq: None\r\npandas_datareader: None\r\n</details>"

    "body": "@rizac : Well 2017 is not 2020, so until then, Python 2.x compatibility must remain :smile: \r\n\r\nHowever, I think `unicode_literals` is your best way to go, as it works just fine with your code, and if it's centering around a `numpy` array creation, that's something that's out of our control I think at this point.    The `ascii` character set is something that is beyond `pandas`.\r\n\r\nTrue, you don't get `bytes`, but at least the code works, and you can always reconvert elements back to `bytes` if you need them to be so subsequently when handling them.
