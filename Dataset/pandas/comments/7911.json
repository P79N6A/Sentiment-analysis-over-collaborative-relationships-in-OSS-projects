    "body": "Along the same lines, should the `rolling_var/std/cov()` and `expanding_var/std/cov()` have a `ddof` parameter the way `Series.var/std()` do (though `Series.cov` does not)? They're all labeled \"unbiased\", and appear to effectively use `ddof=1`, so nothing is wrong, but I don't see why the treatment of `ddof` can't be uniform.\n\nAnd similar my comment above on parameter order, for these functions too I'd like to reorder things a bit, e.g. so that `freq` and `how` are next to each other...\n"
