    "body": "Hey @datapythonista , I was thinking we could actually just remove all warnings/errors we ignore from .pep8speaks.yml. As I imagine that most of the stuff we ignore in setup.cfg/.pep8speaks is most likely due to legacy reasons opposed to a pep8 rule we don't care about. \r\n\r\nThat way when reviewing code we can see that we are not increasing the occurrences of any particular warnings/errors. Say for example if I increase occurrences of `E731` it is down to the reviewer to spot this?\r\n\r\nAs if setup.cfg and pep8speaks.yml are kept consisting a change can increase occurrences of any of these errors without anything highlighting so on the PR. We can keep   `diff_only: True` set as per than current set up. I personally think there is more value in this, as otherwise pep8speaks and flake8 running in CI are just telling us the same thing. What do you think?"
