    "body": "> why do you think these should be able to mutate this object?\r\n\r\n> Mutation like this is plain non-idiomatic as well.\r\n\r\nOkay, here is why.\r\n\r\nI have custom split-apply-combine code, some of which nests multiple times.  `groupby().apply()` is/was not an option (functions may have consequences or\r\nto just prevent an explosion of speculative function calls on the first group due to nesting). Where possible I use generators and may reuse the group dataframes. For such a case it is more performant to avoid copying the returned group dataframes.\r\n\r\nSo other than the oddity about implementation details leaking out, it is nicer to do groupbys if the data is handed back with no strings attached."
