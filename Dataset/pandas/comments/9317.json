I am not sure where the values are coming from or where they are stored, being a novice I would be worried that somehow the class is being appended to since how else can he retrieve the values of badmeta? It should not exist since he is loading a empty json but yet the dataframe has an attribute that is not in the file. A artifact of some sort...\"\n"

It is not for the casual user.\n"
