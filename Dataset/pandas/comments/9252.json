    "body": "The sparse handling for `SparseSeries/Frame` changed in 0.13 to inherit properly from `NDFrame` (as everything was integrated properly back then).\n\nBut `SparsePanel` is still using the 'old' system (basically its a dict of DataFrames). So I wouldn't expect really _any_ API compat, as this has not gotten any attention. I'll mark this, but we need someone interested in making these changes.\n"
