    "body": "Calling shift like this results in data being moved into a new object, e.g.:\n\n```\nIn [15]: df\nOut[15]: \n          0         1         2         3         4\n0  1.072132 -0.702515 -0.554493  0.017083  0.868136\n1  0.043361  0.682429 -0.064944 -1.588128  0.584704\n2  0.040340  0.346544  1.016149 -0.531106 -0.807536\n3  2.104821 -1.281473 -0.272546 -0.101870 -0.242820\n4 -0.611266  0.078882  0.290995  0.538874  0.412343\n\nIn [16]: df.shift(1)\nOut[16]: \n          0         1         2         3         4\n0       NaN       NaN       NaN       NaN       NaN\n1  1.072132 -0.702515 -0.554493  0.017083  0.868136\n2  0.043361  0.682429 -0.064944 -1.588128  0.584704\n3  0.040340  0.346544  1.016149 -0.531106 -0.807536\n4  2.104821 -1.281473 -0.272546 -0.101870 -0.242820\n```\n\n In the second case, the DataFrame contains 10 times as much data, so `shift` takes 10 times as long to run. You can do `shift` more cheaply by creating an array view, but then if you do, say, `df - df.shift(1)` then realignment occurs behind the scenes, so you're just deferring the work\n"

As my application need to 'diff()'  the 50000*200 dataframe several times in a round, the end user need to wait 5-6 second to see the result. That is the No.1 bottleneck.  Any tips to improve?\n"
