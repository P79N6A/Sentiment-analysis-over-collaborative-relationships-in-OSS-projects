Well they'll still be floats inside the object array and lookups will work and all that.\n\nYou know, it would be cool to make a Float64Index class- now that Int64Index has been done and integrated so it will play nice with object Indexes it should be largely a copy-paste job. I'll create a separate github issue about this and tag you in it\n"
