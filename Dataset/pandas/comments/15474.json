    "body": "The rotation is done on purpose, as you would otherwise get overlapping labels (like in your second example plot, only without the non-centered labels).\r\n\r\nSo there are two ways pandas plots datetimes under the hood: ones with a regular frequence, and the ones without regular frequency (that is the reason you see a difference for frames with a different `freq`). The problem is that only for the regular time series, we have custom label formatting (your third plot). For the non-regular, we just use matplotlib default formatting, with this difference that we apply a rotation by default to have non-overlapping labels. \r\nSee https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/15071 for a longer explanation.\r\n\r\nThe shift in the labels (non-centered) when using `rot=0` is a bit annoying."
