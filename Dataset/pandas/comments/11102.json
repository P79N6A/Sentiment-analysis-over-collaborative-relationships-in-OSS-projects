From the link:\n\n> When mapping Unicode to East Asian legacy character encodings\n> - Wide Unicode characters always map to fullwidth characters.\n> - Narrow (and neutral) Unicode characters always map to halfwidth characters.\n> - Halfwidth Unicode characters always map to halfwidth characters.\n> - Ambiguous Unicode characters always map to fullwidth characters.\n> \n> When mapping Unicode to non-East Asian legacy character encodings\n> - Wide Unicode characters do not map to non-East Asian legacy character encodings.\n> - Narrow (and neutral) Unicode characters always map to regular (narrow) characters.\n> - Halfwidth Unicode characters do not map.\n> - Ambiguous Unicode characters always map to regular (narrow) characters.\n\n**When mapping Unicode to East Asian legacy character encodings**: Ambiguous should be handled ad full-width (length=2). It can be covered by the impl added by the PR (`display.unicode.east_asian_width=True`) .\n\n**When mapping Unicode to non-East Asian legacy character encodings**:  Because full width are not mapped (cannot appear), all characters including ambiguous can be regarded as half-width (length=1). It should be corresponding to the current default `display.unicode.east_asian_width=False`.\n\nWhat the situation requires a separate option only for Ambiguous?\n"
