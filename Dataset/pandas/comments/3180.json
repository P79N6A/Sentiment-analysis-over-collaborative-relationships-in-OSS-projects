Saying that, there are a few others also not in DatetimeIndex but in Timestamp, perhaps they should be available as well?  (or maybe it's just strange that the above things work in this way...). Hmmm.\n"

(?)\n\nAt the moment when you subtract a timestamp from another you get a datetime.timedelta... The delta would be an easier thing to do something like this with, since probably modulo \"nanoseconds in a day\" is hopelessly naive to get the time... (it probably is overkillage anyways.)\n"
