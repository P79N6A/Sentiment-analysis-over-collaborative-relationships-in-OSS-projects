    "body": "@ralienpp As the author of the cheat sheet, I chose the color scheme with different shades of colors to indicate relationships between cells of each table. I don't think fill patterns in the cells would work so that you could maintain those relationships. You could try filling the cells with symbols, although I'd be concerned it would get too cluttered.  The cheat sheet was inspired by the one for R (see the link at the bottom of the cheat sheet), and if you print that one out in black-and-white, you can't read half of it because they chose a light-colored font.\r\n\r\nOf course the other solution is to just buy a color printer.  :-)  There are cheap ones on staples.com for less than $50. (Note: I only have black-and-white printers, but just never printed the cheat sheet!)"

I don't know how we maintain the color relationship in black-and-white to indicate the dark/light shading relationship.\r\n\r\nWhat I would need from you is something that said for each of those 9 colors, what RGB to use.  Can you do that?\r\n"
