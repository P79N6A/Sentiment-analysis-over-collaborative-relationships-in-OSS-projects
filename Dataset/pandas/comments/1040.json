So I did `rm -r /Users/deil/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/numpy*`.\n\nThen I couldn't get numpy master to work anymore (segfault when running tests), so I used the Macports numpy 1.6.1 instead.\nWith this numpy all pandas tests pass.\n\nWhen building the docs there's still four WARNINGS and one ImportError,\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/4923986/bug_reports/pandas-docs.log\nbut nevermind, I'm very happy to have a working pandas again.\n\nThanks for your help!\n"
