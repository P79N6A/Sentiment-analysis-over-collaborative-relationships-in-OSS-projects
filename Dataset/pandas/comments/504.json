Essentially, I want:\n`summary`, `cor(frame)`, and `ggplot2` on the result, servable\non the web.\n5)  I don't even want to think about it most of the time.  I want the\nsimple EDA to be as simple as:\n- `eda(frame(\"my.csv\"))`\n- (go to localhost:8888/mydataset, and glory in it!)\n\nPandas gets a lot of things right!\n- data.frame\n- simple plots (using `matplotlib`!)\n- flatten, transform, etc.  (and labeled numpy)\n\nIn both R and Python, each analysis package author tends to reinvent\nthe wheel when it comes to import format.  Sadly, `Orange` suffers\nfrom this as well.\n\nMy fantasy is to have a statistical package:\n- consumable by regularish people (sensible default graphs,\n  suggestions toward actionability, hypothesis generation, easy to get\n  90% of the insights, etc.)\n- maintained by developers (in git/hg, has setup and testing, sensible\n  apis, etc)\n- audited by statisticians (to make the math right)\n\nI know these are Big Ideas, so take them with double-helpings of salt.\n\nGL\n\nOn Mon, Dec 19, 2011 at 3:00 PM, Tim McNamara\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\n> FWIW I expect that the GPL would affect only a tiny minority of users.
