For example, if you also try .05s, it gets cut to 5S. I believe this is because of the (freq // 1000) operation used in grouping.\n\nSomeone else might be able to correct me or give additional insights.\n\nEdit: jreback beat me to it. I might look into this tonight as it seems like it would be interesting, but simple. No promises though.\n"
