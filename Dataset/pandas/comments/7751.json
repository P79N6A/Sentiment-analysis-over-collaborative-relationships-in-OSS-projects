    "body": "In addition to just raising a more informative error, I think that there should be an option to automatically handle duplicates in the following way: \n\nSuppose we have a list with too many duplicates, say we want to split [1,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,5,6,7] into quartiles. Right now qcut fails, because the second-lowest quartile consists entirely of '3's, duplicating the bin edges. But there is a natural way to assign the quartiles if we allow duplicate values to be split among different bins: [1,2,3], [3,3,3], [3,3,4], [5,6,7]. \n\nNow this is not completely ideal -- the assignment is arbitrary, and there is no way of knowing what to do by looking at the bin edges alone. But in the real world it can be convenient to have an option that 'just works', and I think this warrants a 'split_dup=True' option that is false by default. \n\nWhat do people think? I'll add this if people support it.  \n"
