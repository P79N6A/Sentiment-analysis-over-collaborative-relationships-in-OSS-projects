Defaults are/were not ok for me either. I use the auto detect horizontally, which was the default a long time ago, not any more now.\n\nUsing default options, get_terminal_size() is never used. Only when requested by user, doing so is only interesting in a real terminal as indicated in the method docstring and display option descriptions. This is what i do.\nHard wired values (out of user control) are only used in non-interactive mode and if user enabled auto-detection. For this case auto-detect values are overruled with hard-coded values (as requested in #1610). In all other scenarios user can set/control dimensions.\n\nCurrent repr performance is in line/better compared to v0.10.1 (there are only two benchmarks but they cover a frame that is too wide and one too high (a new benchmark i added)).\n\nSo what do you think would make more sense to have as defaults for display.width, heigth, max_rows, max_columns? Auto detect as default can not be done, since this only works in a real terminal, other than than i don`t care what defaults are.\n"

    "body": "- fixed a #1611 related regression, the (new) test was passing by accident as \n  the df dimensions were too small to trigger the fail with the defaults for height/width.\n- width/height auto-detect is now activated by None rather then 0.\n  (made it easier to handle the corner cases, and cleaner I think)\n- re-enabled HTML for qtconsole (I completely agree with @lodagro,\n  this should be user controlled)\n- adjusted defaults of height,width to 80,80. Ipython's notebook defaults to an unusually \n  large font, so the 80 (rather then 100 as I suggested) in the PR works better.\n- ipnb and ipq are now treated equally. this ia a long overdue oversight.\n  The hardcoded default values for dimensions now reuse the defaults\n  of disp.height/width.\n  ip qtconsole was special cased by mistake, when the original Issue was addressed.\n- optimized _repr_fits_horizontal_, beyond @lodagro's fix, the width\n  check now only  generates  the repr for the slice that's about to be printed.\n\nBeyond the test suite, I tested in terminal ipython, qtconsole,ipnb and script\nform with various options, cleared up whatever I found.\n\nI'm uneasy about so much churn and subtlety going on at the RC phase,\nwould have preferred to have it all take place in 0.12.  But enough  is enough.\n\nb9fa04a\n"
