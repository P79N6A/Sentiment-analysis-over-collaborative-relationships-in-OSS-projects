    "body": "@jreback @jtratner Sorry for the slow response, it was late when I posted this last night, and I've been busy all morning today...\n\nThe code I was dealing with is a bit hairy, but the following should illustrate the issue clearly enough:\n\n``` python\nimport numpy, pandas\n\nrng = pandas.date_range('1/1/2011', periods=72, freq='H')\nts = pandas.Series(numpy.random.randn(len(rng)), index=rng)\n\nts.truncate(before='10/31/2011', after='12/31/2011') # No problem here\n\nts.truncate(before='12/31/2011', after='10/31/2011') # Switched dates, to illustrate\n```\n\nThat last line then throws the following error (which is pretty much what I would expect, except that the order of the dates is wrong in the message):\n\n```\nAssertionError: Truncate: 2011-12-31 00:00:00 must be after 2011-10-31 00:00:00\n```\n\nThe author of the actual code which resulted in this had assumed that the dates he was reading in would always be in chronological order - turns out this wasn't the case in one particular CSV file that got imported... Obviously, this has now been fixed with an appropriate failsafe added. I fully agree that users should never see assertion errors, but the confusing error message made the issue harder to debug for me, so I figured it might save someone else the confusion in future.\n"
