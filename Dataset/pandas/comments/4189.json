    "body": "This is definitely a confusing error and error message.  Is there a reason that someone would want to have a \"Storer\" vs. a table? (i.e., why is the default to create something that can't be queried later on...speed?) Why is the default not to store it in PyTables format?\n\nYou definitely can't just emit a warning, because ignoring the where clause potentially means (unintentionally) loading a big database into memory.\n\nI'm not convinced this is a `TypeError` either, but I think it needs to emit an error message that not only clearly states what's going on in terms of the file format, but also specifically direct how to make it possible to work that way.\n\n``` python\nIn [7]: pd.read_hdf('test_storer.h5','df',where='index>5')\nTypeError: Basic HDF5 tables cannot be queried with a 'where' clause. Either do not supply a where clause or load from a 'PyTable' instead (e.g., HDF5 data created using 'to_hdf(...table=True)).\n```\n\nYou probably also need to document this better, given that the only time `table=True` is mentioned in the dev docs on IO is in the Notes & Caveats section:\n\n```\nYou can not append/select/delete to a non-table (table creation is determined on the first append, or by passing `table=True` in a put operation)\n```\n"

The real difference is that `tables` can be appended.\n\nThe reason I brought this up is that I happen to sometimes write `storer's` but mostly write tables. However, I always query them (so in my own code I basically catch the exception and act on it). Just wanted to know what other people do.\n\nleaving it as an exception....maybe i'll update the error message a bit (and I think `TypeError` is correct, as you are basically doing a query on the wrong `type` here)\n"
