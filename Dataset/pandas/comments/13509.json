    "body": "I did a bit of digging and I think I found the issue. `Float64Index.get_value` tries to construct a `Series` with its result if the result is not scalar. A scalar cannot be given as the index for a new `Series`, so the construction of the series fails. This switch in particular seems problematic: https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/indexes/numeric.py#L303 \n\nI can't figure out what that switch is trying to do. Even if the resulting value is not a scalar, it seems to me like it should still be treated like any other value that would be retrieved from a `Series` and simply returned, not used to construct a new `Series`. Codecov reports that this switch is not tested: https://codecov.io/gh/pydata/pandas/src/8131b5151e10f1a5863ccadef739c21320830f54/pandas/indexes/numeric.py#L306 So it's difficult for me to figure out what the intended function of this code is. \n\nI would propose to simply take out the switch and always return the retrieved value. Any objections?\n"
