Then you can detect if its the 'new' mode or the 'original' mode (you can simply look at the `args/kwargs` and figure this out unambiguously).\n\nI would vote to effectively deprecate the original `.update` mode (of course ATM this would just show a `FutureWarning`. This function is really not necessary except in very rare circumstances, and is not well implemented internally.\n\n`df.update(A=df.B/df.C)` looks like a winner to me. (same idea in that it IS pure, but has a more suggestive name than `transform/mutate`. Further we can add the same method to `groupby`).\n"

With `df.update(other_df)` being inplace since `other_df` is positional, but `df.update(a=other_thing`) being the new behavior since it's a keyword. Just in my testing and putting together I've accidentally forgotten the keyword argument multiple times. Having that unexpectedly update my data, potentially without me realizing, would suck.\n\nI was thinking maybe it'd be OK since DataFrames aren't dict-like, so `DataFrame.update` shouldn't have to much cognitive dissonance with dict.update, but we also have a `Seris.update`, and Series _are_ dict-like.\n\nSo I guess what I'm saying is I want to go with `.assign`. (Or maybe [enhance](http://giphy.com/gifs/enhance-yekZxRr4nM1q0) (NSFWish I guess, it's the Super Troopers reference) for the comedic value of chaining a bunch of enhances together, :laughing: ).\n"

New method\n- `update`\n  - pros: again, pretty clear what we're doing\n  - cons: break in API (eventually). Awkward period where we support old behavior on `*args` and new behavior with `**kwargs`. Clashes with `dict.update` which is inplace, while this is not.\n- others: `augment`, `enhance`, `transform`, none of which really gained traction. Also `.set`, (thanks @shoyer )\n\nMy vote is for assign.\n"
