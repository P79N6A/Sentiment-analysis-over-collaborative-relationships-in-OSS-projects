As a result we were able to move most methods to a generic class, and have consisten type signatures for all objects. In this case, this the frame method was much more complete and accepts much more input. This is merely a validation issue, AFAIK. @cpcloud will address shortly. see here: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/whatsnew.html#internal-refactoring\n"
