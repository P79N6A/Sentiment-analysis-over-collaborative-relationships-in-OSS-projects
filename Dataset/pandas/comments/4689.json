Depending on how extensive the change is, an example or description in the documentation showing how you choose to use dateutil vs. pytz.\n\nFinally, if this is supposed to remove a pytz dependency, can you try removing the pytz imports and seeing if this will work without it (and therefore confirm that timezones aren't getting changed under the hood - maybe you're already doing this).\n"

    "body": "I have a number of suspicions/comments (and you should try running cython\n-a <filename> to see which calls will stay c-level vs. Python-level):\n\nI'm assuming that one or more of these functions is being called many many\ntimes, otherwise most of these things would be small.  The major issue (I\nthink) is that you've introduced a number of places where Cython has to\nbump up to Python-level for hasattr/getattr calls. The best way to resolve\nthis would be to have separate functions for pytz vs. dateutil instead of\ndetermining which tz you have each time. We should set up this module to\nreturn the function to apply and avoid the determination each time (and you\nneed to make the assumption that you aren't going to have mixed tzs or\nwhatever) or delegate the iteration to Cython so it can call the function\nfrom there.\n\nI _think_ if you define a few globals that cover some of the underlying\nattributes (like ), etc. you could get some speedups.  You can also use\n`cython -a <filename>` to see which calls will stay c-level vs.\nPython-level (the more yellow, the more Python required).\n\nI believe\n\nIn addition to that, you've added a number of getattr/hasattr calls\n(`module.something.another.thing` means 3 getattr calls, all of which need\nto go to Python level) throughout, particularly the checks for which type\nof tz you have.\n1. You've changed the `is_utc` function from using a predefined global\n   (`_u_utc`) to doing 2 Python getattr lookups: `dateutil.tz.tzutc`.\n2. Your functions to test also add two more hasattr checks which cause two\n   additional calls up to Python-level.\n3. If we're assuming pytz is the standard and you don't want to have\n   separate functions, it could make more sense to make the code try doing it\n   as pytz _first_, catch the attribute error and then use a different code\n   path.\n4. Seems like you could inline each of the cpdef'd functions (and then if\n   you feel like it's actually needed outside of Cython code, provide a Python\n   wrapper class that's def'd).\n5. _is_fixed_offset has gone from one attribute checks + return to 3-6\n   attribute checks at the minimum, plus boolean comparisons, etc.\n6. _tz_cache_key does at least 2 Python lookups (for the pytz checks) + a\n   call to __str__ and type conversion (this may be the same).\n7. You get two python lookups from pytz.tzinfo.BaseTzInfo, probably better\n   to just define a global BaseTzInfo=pytz.tzinfo.BaseTzInfo.\n\nPerhaps the best option is to test for pytz vs. dateutil _once_ then use\ntwo different functions (similar to what we do for code generation for\ndifferent types).  Heck, you could do it at Python level and then pass to\ndifferent functions depending on which you have (or use a dict too lookup\n(i.e.): {'pytz': pytz_func, 'dateutil': dateutil_func}/\n\nNot sure whether isinstance checks would be different (I doubt it)\n"
