The motivation comes from WIP to move arith/comparison ops from DatetimeIndexOpsMixin/DTI/TDI/PI to array classes, where there are currently a bunch of cache_readonlys that need to be flipped.  This seemed like a reasonable scope to break off of what would otherwise be a giant diff (similar train of thought for #19672)."
