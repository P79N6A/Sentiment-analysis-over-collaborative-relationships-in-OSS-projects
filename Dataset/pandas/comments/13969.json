    "body": "> Is there an intrinsic reason `window` can't handle a `CustomBusinessDay`?\n\nAs of now, because offset-based rolling windows are based on converting to nanoseconds (as we are discussing in #13968), which non-fixed frequencies do not support &mdash; the `ValueError` is coming from [here](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/tseries/offsets.py#L511).\n\nThis reaffirms my impression that the whole architecture around `DateOffset` is somewhat broken: we are calling by the same name things that are fundamentally different &mdash; regularity and anchoring being the critical concepts. I think this is something to think about long and hard for [pandas 2.0](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/13944)\n"

    "body": "this is actually pretty easy. the point of `build`  as @chris-b1 [indicated](https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/window.pyx#L252). IS to create the indexers to the window, which by-definition are generally variable (they don't have to be though as that can be done more efficiently by a fixed offset window). \n\nOnce you have this window indexer (and this is pretty cheap to create), then rolling is the same. The current logic assumes a fixed differential indexer (e.g. it has a constant period regardless of the point in time).\n"
