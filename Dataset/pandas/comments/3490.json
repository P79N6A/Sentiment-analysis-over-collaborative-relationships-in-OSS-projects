    "body": "I think the different resolution is a red herring, it seems basically time-series plotting (in tseries/plotting.py) generally doesn't play well with secondary axes.\n\nThis is an example with no resampling that has the same behavior:\n\n``` python\nindex_1 = pd.date_range(start='2000-01-01', periods=4, freq='D')\nindex_2 = pd.date_range(start='2000-01-05', periods=4, freq='D')\n\ns1 = pd.Series(5, index=index_1)\ns2 = pd.Series(7, index=index_2)\n\nax = s1.plot()\ns2.plot(secondary_y=True, ax=ax)\n```\n\nThe second plot call overwrites the x_lim, probably because (internal details of tseries/plotting) `_get_xlim(ax.get_lines())` only references the current axis, and secondary_y creates a second axis object (via `twinx()`), and the two axes aren't considered together. This doesn't happen with a non-timeseries plot, e.g. if you change the indices to `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `[5, 6, 7, 8]`, though I'm not sure why.\n"
