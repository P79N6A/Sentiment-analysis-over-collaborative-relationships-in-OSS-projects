    "body": "Comment on (4): `vbench` seems to have default target time of 1 sec, whereas in `asv` the default is longer `goal_time = 2`. You can override this by having `goal_time = 1` attribute in the benchmark classes. The second difference is that `asv` runs every benchmark in a separate process --- however, importing the benchmark suite takes some time (here probably ~ 0.5 sec), so running each benchmark takes at least that.\n"

Currently in three commits:\n- The first is a file that appears to be missing from the package creation. I believe it was being noticed because of the from-scratch-venvs that `asv` uses. Not sure why this wouldn't generally manifest. Let me know if this should be a separate PR.\n- Second commit is various changes to the existing `vbench` tests. Some are just syntactical sugar changes to help my translation script work better, but most are fixing typos or errors that meant these tests never ran.\n- Third commit is everything dealing with `asv` and as generated by my translation script. The existing errors under asv are almost entirely namespace related and will be easily fixable, just should probably wait to see if anyone desires making changes to the translation. `asv` is verbose about the errors, so they shouldn't go unnoticed like they would under `vbench`.\n\nI think this is ready to merge if some failing tests is okay.\n"

There is an option to explicitly set the number of iterations, but that's not (currently) settable from the command line (nor is `goal_time`).\n\nI probably won't be able to get to a comparison analysis until this weekend, at best.\n\n@jorisvandenbossche Ah, awesome - I had not tried windows. `asv` also supports Python 3, but the translated `vbench` suite (unsurprisingly) looks like it'll need some work to get that running.\n"
