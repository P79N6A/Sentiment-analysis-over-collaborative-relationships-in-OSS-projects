    "body": "On this update, I have decided to create another function in `scripts/announce.py` that uses the `get_authors` in order to get all the names since version 0.3.0. I wanted to use the names already on the wordlist (because it contains some names located in `release.rst` that aren't in `get_authors`) so I turned those names into a set, then updated the set with the names that I got from `get_authors`. \r\n\r\nThe plan to use sets is to try and avoid duplicated names. I have also updated the regex to avoid some characters but not all non-words (names such as O'Leary as marked as a single word).\r\n\r\nNow when the command `python make.py spellcheck` is run the function `update_name_wordlist()` will be called before the spelling extension - so all names will be updated before spellcheck is run.\r\n\r\nI also updated the bit that datapythonista wrote to just add `ModuleNotFoundError` and replaced logging.warn by logging.warning - because the .warn method is deprecated.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the code in `update_name_wordlist` is the most efficient one so I'm more than happy to change something if you think there are better ways to do this.\r\n\r\nFinally, I have been reading about CI and how to add it to the docbuild but I am unsure how to do this, I have also read the scripts located in the ci folder. I'd appreciate some guidance in this matter as I have no idea how to proceed from here (my apologies).\r\n\r\nFinally, is it worth it to make a test in order to try and bump coverage up since it went down a bit?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n"

And that being based in enchant, which is a deprecated project, it even makes less sense to have it. We can surely have a separate repo in the pandas org that checks in the pandas repo whether there is any typo with all this system we have, that would be very useful. But having it in pandas, when afaik none of the maintainers was able to set it up, doesn't seem to be worth.\r\n\r\nIn any case, can you let @FabioRosado if he should rebase so we can merge it, or just close the PR. Thanks!"
