There will always be some overhead.\r\n\r\n> The question is then: could that choice be done internally in pandas?\r\n\r\nThe next step would be to profile the functions. I'd recommend [snakeviz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/) and [line profiler](https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler). I'd recommend identifying specific issues and opening narrowly scoped issues for each thing you discover."
