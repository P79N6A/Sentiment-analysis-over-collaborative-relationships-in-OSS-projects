I switched pandas-datareader to this and the build time dropped form 3 to 1.5, which is something for a small project.\n\nIn terms of buidl time, I don't think it woudl do much for pandas.  However, if you get faster access to build servers then it could be worth it - the backlog of PRs can get pretty big at times.\n"
