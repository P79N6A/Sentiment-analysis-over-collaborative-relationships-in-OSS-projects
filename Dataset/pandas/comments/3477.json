I looked at the code a couple of days ago, my apologies if \nsome points are now stale:\n- [x] 1 `io` arg might be a url, in which case, should do the right thing. pd.read_csv does this\n  ( I voted this down originally and I was wrong). see helper in `io.parsers._read` for free lunch.\n- [x] 2- i agree with @jreback that you should return a list of dataframes, and my vote goes for \n  returning a singleton list even when a match is specified/only one table. I see this\n  as `pd.read_html()`. The user is then free to index the returned list so I suggest jetissoning\n  `table_number`.\n- [x] 3- the docstring note on \"expect some cleanup\" is somewhat opaque. what does it mean?\n- [x] 4 `df.applymap` currently bombs on duplicate labels (#2786), need to workaround for now.\n- [x] 5_get_skiprows_iter is not actually used anywhere\n- [x] 6 not clear what other legal values for `flavor` are.\n- [x] 7- dedicating all kwargs to be passed off somewhere is a back-compat killer,\n  since if we need to change something later on we can't add anything to the signature,\n  make it a named dict arg instead (perhaps yanked by name from **kwargs).\n  Also, doesn't make sense if you're using `lxml` directly. so if the user specified them\n  but uses a diff engine, should probably raise in that case.\n- [x] 8 -name bikeshedding:  s/convert/`infer_types` ?\n"

I also wanted the challenge of learning some xpath along the way so I thought why not do both?\n"
