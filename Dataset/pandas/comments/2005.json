    "body": "sure. \n\n**what's this for**\nThe general idea is to make pandas Unicode-friendly.\n\nUnicode problems have been fixed many times before,but there are\nstill issues throughout the code base, and perhaps more importantly,\nI think it's worthwhile to consolidate the previous fixes and general handling of\nUnicode into a small, well-defined and documented set of functions to be used\neverywhere. \n\nPR #1994 already picked some low-hanging fruit, mainly having to do with\nisinstance(str) checks which should have been isinstance(basestring).\n\n**This PR** focuses on consolidating the code for the general task of pprinting\nobjects throughout pandas.  9e45f252d9 defines two workhorse functions which\ntackle the pprinting of objects, and the rest of the commits in the series modify\nexisting functions throughout the tree to use them and add tests to document \npreviously broken behavior. the next series would get rid of the stringify*/strify\nfunctions to use this (to-be) sanctioned  API for pprinting as well.\n\n**These changes have a few merits:**\n\n1) They localize (somewhat) the code which needs to do the \"right\" \nthing as far as Unicode is concerned. currently there's a lot of ad-hoc\nfixes which have built-up to fix previous bugs, this gave rise to code \nduplication and corner-cases which are not handled properly.\n\n2) They makes clearer the distinction between text and Unicode/str. \nthe conflation of these two gives rise to most of the Unicode bugs\nI've seen so far. it makes it easier to reason about py3 compat as well.\nthe former convention of using functions named  str\\* is unfortunate\nbecause they are ambiguous. it would be an improvement to designate\nnew function which emphasize the distinction between text and encoded\nstrings/bytes\n\n3) **so far, nothing should break** (unless it's \"plain wrong\").\n\nregarding the test removed by 65044e844ee88d98, I can see why it's useful\nbehavior for someone of that locale, but it means exceptions for other people.\nif a default encoding is assumed, I can't see how it could be anything other \nthen utf-8, but currently the default encoding scattered in the code is \"None\".\n[chardet](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/chardet) might give universal encoding detection ( it seems\nto require longish input to work, but I might be wrong ), but until that's\nimplemented, or 'utf-8' becomes officially the default, IMO 65044e84 just \nverifies that the wrong thing happens . (btw, I'm all for a utf-8 default encoding,\nif it's done consistently, see PR #2006).\n\n4) The new pprint functions handle more cases gracefully, so that \npandas feels friendlier to users outside the latin-1 world, or just\npeople who use strange code-points in their labels.\n\nan example of the problem:\n\n> In [130]: repr(u'\\u03bb',)\n> Out[130]: \"(u'\\u03bb',)\"\n\nbut  a user would rather see something like:\n\n> In [130]: repr(u'\\u03bb',)\n> Out[130]: (λ,)\n\n...at least on consoles that support utf-8 or some suitable encoding,\nmost notably ipython qtconsole/notebook.\nthe code in this PR does that, and relies on `print_config.encoding` \n(with improved detection burrowed from ipython) as the encoding for\nthings sent to the console.\n\nsome future PR might require API changes, which can be discussed then.\nmainly around the question of mandatory encoding vs default encoding\nvs. guessing an encoding.\n\nthere are still more things to do, if one of the commiters gives an ack on this,\nI can go ahead knowing that i'm not wasting effort down this path.\n"
