    "body": "> remove the first clause else (which just sets utc_date = val, then this is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nI think there may be some confusion about the underlying issue.  In the case where `utc_date = val`, you're right that the change in line 448/451 is irrelevant.  The problem is that in the case where `utc_date != val`, the change here may matter.\r\n\r\nThe new assertion here is a band-aid that ensures we never get to cases where the change here matters.  Ideally we shouldn't need that assertion.\r\n\r\nThe status-quo use of `val` in line 448 is an outlier that does not fit with either a) the rest of this function or b) the implementation in `tz_convert`.  The latter is the bug in question.  Changing `val` --> `utc_date` in line 451 is very much a good thing.\r\n"
