    "body": "So, this is unfortunate... The real fix will be fixing https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/15071, which is a good bit of work. Since the index is regular frequency, we use `Periods` instead of date times / timestamps.\r\n\r\nAnother workaround is to draw the `axvline` with a Period\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [89]: ax.axvline(pd.Period('2017-01-04T12'), color='r')\r\nOut[89]: <matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x111f91518>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't think there's any way we can reliably detect this and warn the user though, at least not without false positives :/"
