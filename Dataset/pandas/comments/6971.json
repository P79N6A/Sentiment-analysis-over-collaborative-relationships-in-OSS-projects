The docstring was updated to use `skipfooter`, but `io.rst` still needs to be updated.\n\n> Drop skipfooter in favour of an enhanced version of skiprows.\n\nHmm, this sounds like an elegant solution but I don't think it would cover all use cases: with the current convention we'd expect `skiprows=[6,-2]` to skip the 6th row and the 2nd row from the end (only 2 rows). I suppose we could make `skiprows=-n` skip the last `n` rows, but that would use up the `skiprows` argument so we couldn't easily skip a header as well...\n"

Since a construction with ranges becomes very fast very ugly (e.g. range(1,7,1), range(-1,-3,-1)) I'm wondering whether a tuple could be a solution: skiprows=(6,-2)\n"
