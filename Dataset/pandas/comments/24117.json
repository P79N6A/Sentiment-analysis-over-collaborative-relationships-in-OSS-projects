    "body": "Hello all, thanks so much for your thoughtful comments. In case it's helpful, I wanted to clarify my motivation for this PR:\r\n\r\nI love that the pandas documentation provides a great level of detail about much of the pandas functionality. However, many sections of the documentation lack what might be most helpful to beginners (in my opinion), which is a high-level overview of \"how do I accomplish some common task\" or \"when should I use this particular feature\", along with corresponding examples using real-world datasets.\r\n\r\nFor example, a beginner might have many of these questions:\r\n\r\n- What exactly is the \"axis\"?\r\n- When should I use \"inplace\"?\r\n- What is the purpose of the index?\r\n- When should I use a \"groupby\"? What do the results tell me?\r\n- How do I use the MultiIndex? What's the purpose of it?\r\n- How do I fix the SettingWithCopyWarning? What happens if I just ignore it?\r\n- and so on...\r\n\r\nTo be fair, the answers to many of these questions may be available in the documentation, but they are not often easy to find (in my experience), especially if you don't already know the terminology to look for. And when you do find the right section, the deep level of detail can obscure the high-level information.\r\n\r\nMy goal, when creating this video series, was specifically to answer many of those beginner and intermediate questions. I use real-world datasets to make the examples more relatable. And each video is titled such that if you just want to know about some particular topic (e.g., how to use a string method), you immediately know which video to watch by its title (\"How do I use string methods in pandas?\")\r\n\r\nMy guess is that lots of beginners poke around in the documentation, looking for answers to these questions, and many of them come across the Tutorials page. For those users, I wanted to provide an easy way to get an answer to their particular question, which is why I listed the videos out individually.\r\n\r\nHowever, I totally understand if my vision for the Tutorials page is not in line with the core team's vision for this page, and I'm happy to proceed however you like!"

And PRs to help on that are more than welcome.\r\n\r\nFor me the discussion is whether we want to maintain a page of external resources for pandas. I think the people who can merge these PRs have already enough work, to have to review the linked content, and deal with the spam that such a page will generate (once we make navigating the documentation easier).\r\n\r\nI won't be reviewing the content, and my feeling is that nobody else will in most cases. So, I'd leave that task to some external website that is interested on maintaining a list of pandas resources.\r\n\r\nI'm ok if somebody wants to review and merge this.

Which it isn't at the moment. And it's not only about reviewing PRs with new additions, but also cleaning up current content, as older links also get out of date. \r\nOn the other hand, a good *curated* page similar to this is also very valuable to users.\r\n\r\n> For example, a beginner might have many of these questions:\r\n\r\nAll good questions, and *ideally*, those should be much better answered in the main docs as well ..
