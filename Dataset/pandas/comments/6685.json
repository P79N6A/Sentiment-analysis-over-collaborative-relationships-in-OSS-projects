In principle these allow the reason for the missing value to be encoded (e.g. .a for non-response, .b for negative value, etc),  In theory these could be set, and I thought about how to do this once, but I think it probably isn't a feature that would have much use since pandas doesn't really have a good method to handle different types of missing values.  \n\nThe idea I had at the time would require a passing a second DataFrame with some additional information about the missing data codes to use.  Not worth the effort IMO.\n"
