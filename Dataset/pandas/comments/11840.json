But in this case (integer index), it is label based. Do you know if this difference in behaviour for `ix` vs `loc` for this case (reindex or raise) is somewhere discussed or documented? \nIt seems that `ix` will always have 'reindex' behaviour and does not check if the labels are in the index (apart from the cases where it falls back .. :-))\n"
