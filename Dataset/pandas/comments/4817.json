    "body": "Actually, the way I understand it is a bit different. When we speak about analysing data, there is often a so called \"drill-down\" involved, which will naturally result in an MI. But then, I actually want intermediate aggregates as well as shown in the following picture, e.g.:\r\n![bild18-extpivtab_rollup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11851285/33654798-85e0b680-da71-11e7-8a5f-047696393eab.png)\r\nNow in pandas, all I could get is the full margins (\"Gesamt Ergebnis\" in the picture) but not the intermediate one for the higher levels.\r\nI, for one, would be very interested in being able to show those intermediate sums in a pivot table (which, technically, would be \"rolled up\" values). It would seem to me that #3149 is just about that."
