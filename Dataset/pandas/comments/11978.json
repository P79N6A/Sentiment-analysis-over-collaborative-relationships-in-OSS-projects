There is not much effort for a style update to make them look better, e.g. compared to seaborn, because of a lack of developers. \nHowever, we need them in support of the models and other stats functions and still keep adding more. \nFor example, acf and pacf are some of our oldest plot functions and won't go away.\n\nTrying to use seaborn as optional statsmodels dependency to upgrade plots is an idea but doesn't have a champion to look into it and work on it. For many plots the focus of seaborn is exploratory analysis which is more similar to the pandas use, but for us having a model inside the plot is inside out because we need plots inside the models, or after having estimated a model.\n"

Are those all smart enough by now, or will there be, at least temporary, problems?\n\nIn statsmodels all plot functions try except protect matplotlib import, but we would still have to watch out for circular module imports when statsmodels reuses seaborn. However, that's a internal problem not a distribution problem.\n"
