    "body": "Thanks for the report, this is same issue as #12585 - the fundamental problem is that were are calling out to the `dateutil` and there isn't a way to enforce or even capture strictness there - see https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil/issues/214.\r\n\r\nSo we are all for changing this, I think some work has been going on within dateutil to maybe make this possible, but I haven't followed that closely - any kind of PR to help would be welcome!\r\n"
