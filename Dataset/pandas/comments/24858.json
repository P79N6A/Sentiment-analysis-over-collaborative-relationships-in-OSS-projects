    "body": "OK, so it might be due to the incomplete implementation. Because if I add a `def __array__`, it also works (without needing to define `_formatting_values`). \r\nBut, currently, the interface docs don't list `__array__` / or the ability to be convertible to an ndarray as mandatory (although that last one is maybe obvious).\r\n\r\nThe special case here is that I have objects that have a length, so if you want to convert them to a numpy array, `np.array(vals)` fails (with the error above), and you need to explicitly specify object dtype as `np.array(vals, dtype=object)`  \r\n\r\nIt is probably obvious that `np.array(EA)` needs to work (I was just trying to make a minimal demo example, so therefore didn't do this yet). \r\nBut should we be more explicit what the expected return type is here? Is it expected to be an array of the scalar type? (`EA..dtype.type`)\r\n\r\nAnd maybe we should be explicit in `_formatter` that the formatting function is called on elements after converting to an ndarray, not to scalars of the EA directly. As currently we don't assume this is the same (eg in a DatetimeArray, it can be np.datetime64 instance vs pd.Timestamp) "
