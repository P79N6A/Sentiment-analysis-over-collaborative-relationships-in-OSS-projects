While `NaTType` and `Timestamp` are available to the python space (and the c-space).\n\nThe entire reason for this is that `datetime` is untimately sub-classes in c-land as its a python extension type.\n\n@wesm original comment.\n\n```\n# This is PITA. Because we inherit from datetime, which has very specific\n# construction requirements, we need to do object instantiation in python\n# (see Timestamp class above). This will serve as a C extension type that\n# shadows the python class, where we do any heavy lifting.\n```\n"
