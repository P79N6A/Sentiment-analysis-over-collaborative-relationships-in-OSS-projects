    "body": "Perhaps I should have written the test in a more readable way to highlight the bug.  I was just writing it for the future to get all the test cases in a very concise manner and try to flex various ways the datetime strings are parsed.\n\nThe current situation is just wrong:\n\n```\nIn [3]: pd.to_datetime('01-01-2013 08:00:00+08:00').value\nOut[3]: 1357027200000000000\n\nIn [4]: pd.to_datetime('2013-01-01T08:00:00+0800').value\nOut[4]: 1356998400000000000\n```\n\nThese timestamp strings `01-01-2013 08:00:00+08:00` and `2013-01-01T08:00:00+0800` represent the same thing.  However, depending on which internal parsing method is triggered, the timezone offset is either used or ignored.  It should be consistent, and the most logical system would be to use the timezone offset if given.  And in fact, every other method that parses things into datetime64s does use the offset, so this just fixes it for the one case where it didn't (which I assume was an oversight).  This is that same code after the fix:\n\n```\nIn [3]: pd.to_datetime('01-01-2013 08:00:00+08:00').value\nOut[3]: 1356998400000000000\n\nIn [2]: pd.to_datetime('2013-01-01T08:00:00+0800').value\nOut[2]: 1356998400000000000\n```\n\nThis is certainly what the code should be doing.\n\nThis could break somebodies code who depends on this bug, but on the plus side:\n\na) All of the existing tests pass\nb) If it did break somebody's code it would be really easy to fix (either strip the timezones out of your datetime strings or just accept with the fact that the code is now properly converting them to UTC)\nc) As this code gets more complicated (like with the potential changes to speed it up), keeping this inconsistency is just going to make everything more confusing because the bug will be triggered in less predictable ways\n"
