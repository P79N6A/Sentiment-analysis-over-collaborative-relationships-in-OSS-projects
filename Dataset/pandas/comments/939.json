If somebody else feels like they are better suited I would be happy to contribute individual fixes to their tree.\n\nIf there are no takers, I will give it a shot myself. Though I will probably need a fair amount of hand-holding to get started.\n\nRunning the already written tests, it appears the `Index` api has changed. Is that possible? Can anybody point me to the PR / issue to help me understand how to adapt the code appropriately?\n\n[pandas/core/range.py#L61-L76](https://github.com/ARF1/pandas/blob/a2c6ea35fdac8d262f777c9c92c53b9980270b59/pandas/core/range.py#L61-L76) has the following segment in its `__init__()` which seems no longer possible:\n\n```\nself = np.array([], dtype='int64').view(RangeIndex)\n...\nself.left = left\n```\n\nAs I understand this, `RangeIndex` being a subclass of `Index` used to be a `ndarray` subclass but is no longer, right?\n"

I am thinking I need to rewrite the test suite first.\n\nWould it make sense to copy and adapt the test suite of the `Int64Index` and progressively eliminate the test failures? My thought was that `RangeIndex` should behave largely identical viewed from the outside (apart from instantiation).\n"

    "body": "A working (at least apparently so) implementation of `RangeIndex()` is now available as PR #9977.\n\nI decided to re-implement rather than use existing trees: the change in the `Index` api was making things too difficult to adapt.\n\nThis implementation is fully compatible with `Int64Index()` and automatically falls back to its implementation when required. If this happens, an equivalent `Int64Index()` is created on-the-fly with obvious performance implications.\n\nAt present only with a limited set of operations the `RangeIndex()` is conserved: e.g. slicing, inner-, left- and right-joins, `size` and `__len__()`, .\n\nMy aim would be to merge with the current feature set as soon as possible and add more type-conserving operations with subsequent PRs to avoid the fate of the previous efforts with `RangeIndex()` which seem to have been overtaken by the continuing development of pandas.\n\nI would welcome any advice and comments for making this happen.\n\nSpecial thanks go to @jreback and @shoyer for their advice and helping me get started.\n"
