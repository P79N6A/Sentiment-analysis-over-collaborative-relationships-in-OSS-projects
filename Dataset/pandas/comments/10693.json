    "body": "It _should_ give you memory improvement if the db api/engine is hooked up correctly, right?\n\nUsing it with sqlalchemy+psycopg2 it needs to make sure that `sqlengine.dialect.server_side_cursors == True` for the `sqlengine.execute` call to be separate from the `results.fetchmany` call. This seems to be a postgres-only issue and engine option because of how it handles cursors (perhaps?).\n\nHowever, sqlalchemy's [`engine.execution_options`](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/core/connections.html#sqlalchemy.engine.Connection.execution_options) API provides `stream_results` which will try to execute without pre-buffering. \n\n> stream_results – Available on: Connection, statement. Indicate to the dialect that results should be “streamed” and not pre-buffered, if possible. This is a limitation of many DBAPIs. The flag is currently understood only by the psycopg2 dialect.\n\nMaybe pandas could try and set that flag if `chunksize is not None`?\n"
