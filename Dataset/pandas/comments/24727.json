    "body": "Sorry about that. Yes, I added it. It's not required, but I thought it made more sense to just leave the files that were built in the last run, mainly for the single pages. I had some cases where I wasn't sure what was built and what was already there. But it's perfectly fine to remove it, and call `make.py clean` explicitly, I just didn't think it would be a problem for anyone."
