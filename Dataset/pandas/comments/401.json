    "body": "Ordinarily I use panels like everybody else, i.e. item orientation.\nSometimes however, I use minor orientation because it may be important to\nkeep dtype information. But in both cases they contain the same type of\ninformation. Then I have written some functions that work on these Panels\nand produce further output. Either I tell them the orientation of the\npanel, or they get it by themselves from the Panel.\n\nTo get more specific, my panels are usually portfolios, ie one DataFrame\nfor each date, major are assets, minor are portfolio weights (eg long and\nshort weights). In this case, item orientation is fine because all data is\nfloat. In other circumstances, my portfolio dataframes include additional\ninfo (stock sectors, currency etc.), so here my data is mixed type and I\ntend to use minor orientation.\nThen I have a function that evaluates these portfolios, ie calculates nav\nseries, and this should handle both cases transparently. Right now this\nfunction has a parameter that tells orientation of passed panel.\n\nYou are right, this might seem ad hoc for my situation, but on the other\nhand it just gives the object's user a piece of information on how it was\nconstructed and would allow for better overall consistency.\n\nThanks\nChris\n\nOn Tue, Nov 22, 2011 at 17:45, Wes McKinney <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\n> wrote:\n> \n> Hm, how would that work exactly?
