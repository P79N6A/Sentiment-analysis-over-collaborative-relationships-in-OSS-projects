    "body": "Hey @jreback, I understand this issue isn't much use without a reproducible example.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to provide one, as I can't really speculate on what the features of the file are that are causing the issue without guessing myself.  I figured it would be good to share to (1) document that there is at least some subset of valid json files that causes a seg fault in the current implementation that (2) functions differently in the REPL vs the Python interpreter and to (3) provide a GDB stack trace to assist in future debugging if a similar issue is raised in the future. If I'm wrong on those counts, feel free to delete the issue wholesale.\r\n\r\nFor now, I'm closing the issue, thanks."
