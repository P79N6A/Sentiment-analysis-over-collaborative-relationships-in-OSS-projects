    "body": "This should be fairly easy for a newcomer to the code to examine, so I'll write up a quick note on how a newcomer might do that.\n\nAs background, you should have a vague idea of what LaTeX is. If you're not familiar with it, http://scottmcpeak.com/latex/whatislatex.html is a good introduction.\n- First, find out where the docs say that the force_unicode option is accepted here\n- Second, read the code, and see if force_unicode is accepted.\n\nOn my system, I search for the code with this command:\n\n<pre>git grep 'def to_latex'</pre>\n\nAnd I get these results:\n\n<pre>\npandas/core/format.py:    def to_latex(self, force_unicode=None, column_format=None):\npandas/core/frame.py:    def to_latex(self, buf=None, columns=None, col_space=None, colSpace=None,\n</pre>\n\nI presume part of the problem is that core/format.py seems to accept the option, but core/frame.py does not.\n\nThe bug seems to be purely a documentation issue -- reading the code for to_latex() within core/format.py, we see a force_unicode option, but the code indicates that the option is deprecated.\n\nTherefore, the correct fix _seems_ (at the time of writing) to be to adjust the to_latex() function within core/format.py so that the docstring properly indicates that force_unicode exists, but is deprecated, and that the option does nothing.\n\nLet this not serve as a replacement for you doing your own research; you (if you submit a pull request with a fix) should fact-check the claims here before submitting a pull request.\n"
