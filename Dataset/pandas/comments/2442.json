    "body": "While we are on it, may I suggest a feature about `read_csv`? The FEC file I used (it was 700+MB a week ago) was too large for 4GB memory I have on my macbook. If I try to read the file in one run, it would take forever because of page fault. But since not all 20 or so columns were used, I read file in 4 chunks, ditched half unused columns, appended it to a accumulator and ended up with a big `DataFrame`, which held all rows but only columns I was interested in.\n\nSo having an option to tell `pandas.read_csv` to only read certain columns could be very useful.\n"
