    "body": "I don't think `is_string_like_dtype` needs to change, because it is exactly meant to only check for actual numpy string types (although the name could be better). \r\n\r\nI agree in principle on `is_string_dtype`, but I am not sure it is that easy to do. I mean that this would need a check of each current usage in the codebase to see whether it actually needs strings or if it actually meant to check for general object dtype.\r\n\r\nIt might be easier (short term) to rename the current one and add a new one that is stricter and that we can start using where we know we really want strings."
