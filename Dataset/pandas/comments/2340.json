I believe this was supported in 0.8.1 as well.\n\nFrom docstring:\n\n```\n        Notes\n        -----\n        If passing an existing ExcelWriter object, then the sheet will be added\n        to the existing workbook.  This can be used to save different\n        DataFrames to one workbook\n        >>> writer = ExcelWriter('output.xlsx')\n        >>> df1.to_excel(writer,'sheet1')\n        >>> df2.to_excel(writer,'sheet2')\n        >>> writer.save()\n```\n\n**edit:** the [docs](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_excel.html?highlight=to_excel#pandas.DataFrame.to_excel) do mention this, in fact look like they are derived from the docstring in this case.\n"
