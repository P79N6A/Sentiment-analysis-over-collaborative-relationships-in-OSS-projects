It's confusing because the functions seem really similar and a good candidate for abstracting into a class definition. Not even necessarily because it would reduce code duplication, but because it could make the file easier to follow (i.e., a workflow described as `get_data` -> `clean_data` -> `package_data [into appropriate type, like Series/Panel]`) and would allow us to do a better job in standardizing error handling and making it easier to add in new data sources (or allow people to make plugins or something).\n"
