We're already changing the links of all the api/ since `api.rst` was splitted, so I'd say let's try to make the structure as close as what we want for the future for 0.24 already.\r\n\r\nReorganizing the current pages should be quite fast, there are almost PRs for everything, except few pages that we'll require some discussion. But some changes will surely happen in the future, as it'll take much longer to split pages, and fine tune the structure.\r\n\r\nI'd say for what we discussed during the sprint, we're all happy with having few top level sections (user guide, development, whatsnew...), and also with the theme change. My opinion is that we should implement those, and then it'll be easier to discuss about the more \"advanced\" things like the home page, the navigation, the integration with the website... We tried twice to work on a one-shot documentation migration, and we failed, I think making the changes with small PRs is working much better.\r\n\r\nI'm flexible on the `basics` and `dsintro`, I'd probably keep them in the getting started for now, as there is not much more than the `10min` there, and may be move them later. But also happy having them in the user guide, it's just that the getting started will look quite poor, and I think users would probably appreciate some more recommended readings to start with (and those are the best we have for now)."

    "body": "I use the online docs quite a bit and am wondering what is the rationale for the new format of the Table of Contents. The new format nicely compresses the main TOC tree into reasonable starting groups, however it detrimentally removes a third level of the tree that is very useful for quickly identifying and navigating to subsections of individual User Guide main topics.\r\n\r\nFor example the new format now only has `User Guide>MultiIndex / Advanced Indexing`\r\n\r\n`MultiIndex / Advanced Indexing` itself is a very long page, as are most others, with many different sub-topics. Previously these subtopics were listed as part of the TOC tree. I hope this third level will return as one now has to scroll through lengthy pages to try and find desired content. This can be particularly painful depending on the device from which you access the docs.\r\n\r\nCan't the third level be added as an expansion of the tree that occurs upon click? This would allow the new compact organization to be maintained.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the work being done to maintain and improve this great tool.\r\n"

    "body": "@datapythonista I think @neili02 is pointing out what I mentioned this weekend as well: for some reason the TOC now only shows two levels, instead of 3, which has the consequence you don't see anything of TOC from the page you are on.\r\n\r\nLooking at it, I think this is due to the change here https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/commit/013ae3daf2b6793478f58e9e88d6d36c308f69b7 where we changed maxdepth from 4 to 2 for the main index.rst. So it seems this toctree depth is what determines the depth, whatever depth you put on eg `user_guide/index.rst`.\r\n\r\n"
