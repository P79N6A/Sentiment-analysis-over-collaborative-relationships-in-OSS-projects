    "body": "@jtratner Just submitted a PR at #4890.  Only the first test was failing locally for me, but I fixed both.  I guess I was asserting that an array with a single float was equal to a single float.\n\nI'm not too happy with how the FRED reader works right now.  FRED has an official API that might be better to target than how it's done now.  But that's for another day.\n"
