    "body": "Storing DataFrames inside a Series/DataFrame is not really supported, and not guaranteed to work. \r\nSo as somebody also answered on the mailing list, you should try to avoid this.\r\n\r\nIf you all you want is the ability to get the correct subframe using indexing, you can also store the frames in a dictionary. The `df = all_data.loc[measurementID, \"measurement_data\"]` would then just become `df = all_data_dict[measurementID][\"measurement_data\"]`. \r\nAnd the apply could look like `all_data_dict = {key: func(parent.loc[key]) for key in parent.index}`.\r\n\r\nTo your question on why the second function fails and the first one not: pandas tries to fit in the returned value into the dataframe (eg if it returns a series, those will be used as the different columns of the resulting frame). This fails for a DataFrame as the dimensions don't match.\r\n\r\n"
