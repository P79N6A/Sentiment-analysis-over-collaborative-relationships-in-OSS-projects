    "body": "@jreback Is there a general way to think about arith methods for NDFrames?\n\nFrom what I can tell. \n1. If `other` is scalar, result should be the same as `op(val, other)` for every element in .values.\n2. Any array-like `other` must have `self.ndim >= other.ndim`\n3. If `other` is array-like but not an NDFrame, it must match the shape of axes it's applying to. Lower dim `other` will be broadcasted along the unused axis.\n4. If `other` is `NDFrame`, outer join the objects and then `op` the aligned objects. Lower dim `other` broadcast like regular array once alignment occurs. \n\nI think those rules should be true for all NDFrames, regardless of dimensions. However, this breaks down in my head when it comes to #4 and Panel/4D. \n\n`DataFrame.mul(Series, axis='columns')` can add a column in the resultant `DataFrame`. \n\nHowever, `Panel.mul(DataFrame, axis='items')` could never expand `items`. \n\nIs the issue that technically axis should be `Panel.mul(DataFrame, axis=('major', 'minor')` and we `items` as convenience? If we were multiplying a Panel4D by a DataFrame, how would we specify the axis? \n\nProbably overthinking it but wanted a programatic way to test arith methods on all NDFrame subclasses.\n"

    "body": "see the `_combine` method, which tests each of these cases, e.g. scalar, series, frame, panel, > panel\n\nand on anything > 2 dims we don't (or shouldn't) support an ndarray because its unclear how to align it (unless it exactly matches dims, so its clear) - I don't think is really tested either (though maybe combine falls thru and so it raises)\n\nIOW, leary of doing any sort of automatic broadcasting with > 2 dims (except via specific `.mul` methods which provide a broadcasting axis)\n\nas far as those go, there is a note in the docs about how wes decided to handle them, somewhere in basicas. (so i think you are right in that regards).\n"
