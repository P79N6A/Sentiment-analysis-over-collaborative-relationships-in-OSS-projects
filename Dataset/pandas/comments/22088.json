So I don't see how that accomplishes what I am looking for.\r\n\r\n2. In your \"second change\", I do not want to create a new dataframe, I already have valid dataframe and I am simply selecting the columns that I want to plot. There doesn't appear anything in the documentation that would prevent passing the same column name to both the x and the y argument.\r\n\r\nI understand that there is a work around (create a copy of the series I want to plot against itself) but it seems that the plot method should be able to handle the plotting without this step."

Say `f(t)` is what is currently done and I want to investigate if `g(t)` is a better model (e.g. gives a higher value). One way to visualize this is to scatter plot `g(t)` vs `f(t)` where each point is a different t. By plotting `f(t) vs f(t)` it is really clear if the point `(f(t1), g(t1))` is above or below that line.\r\n\r\nA related example is if you have a known value, `x` and an estimate of that value, `x'`, then plotting the points `(x, x')` and overplotting the line `x = x` again visually shows how good the estimates are.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I believe the current `plot()` behavior is unnecessarily restrictive.\r\n\r\nGood point @RobMulla re: the `y` list."
