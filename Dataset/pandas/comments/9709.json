    "body": "this will be resolved by #8260 \n\ncurrently the dtype of datetimes with timezones are of `object` dtype (and NOT `datetime64[ns]`\nand hence there is not timezone information indicated on the column. It IS on the individual objects.\n\nSo this is a highly inefficient way to do things, but was simpler when it was implemented (quite a while ago).\n"
