    "body": "SPSS is the only file format that is exportable from common survey tools like Qualtrics, SurveyGizmo, and SurveyMonkey that allows you to preserve both the values and the labels for many variables. \r\n\r\nSurvey data seems to always be represented as one row per response and one column per questions or question choice. For single select questions or Open ended , the values are usually coded as a single number per choice, so a column may have a 1, 2, or 3 for male, female, or 'prefer not to state'. If you can multi-select, most survey tools export questions like Q2_1, Q2_2, Q2_3... for each of the possible choices, and then each cell has a 1 for Selected and a null/SYSMIS/NaN value if it was not selected. Sometimes, that missing data is also coded as a -99 or other values. \r\n\r\nFinally, SPSS has 2 properties, VARIABLE LABELS and VALUE LABELS that contain the Strings that tend to correspond to question text/choice text. \r\n\r\nIf you export a survey file as CSV from any of those tools, you are presented with the choice to either take the strings from each questions (e.g. \"Strongly Agree\" will be what is in each cell where that was selected) or, you can have a '5'. the trouble is that for many types of analysis you want both. In pandas, I think it would be easy to treat all of these as category labels with pd.categorical. \r\n\r\nThe common use case for this is to see what the average scale rating is for a question - e.g. in a Disagree <---> Agree scale is to get a mean response / st dev. But, you may also want to produce a cross tab that shows you count/percent for each category column. SPSS can do this pretty well, but, it is expensive, slow, and has a really lame internal syntax language. \r\n\r\nIf pandas had full support for SPSS files, and could write them out, it would be very helpful for doing both initial data exploration, question aggregation, data restructuring, text analysis, and then write out the new file to leverage other downstream tools like Wincross for reporting/analysis that require SPSS files and are easy for business/non-techncial people to use. \r\n\r\n_As someone that deals with a lot of survey data, I'm happy to talk/chat/answer any questions I can about this, and to test anything out in SPSS if it would help anyone. Note that I'm a novice when it comes to python/pandas, but I've been using SPSS for a long time and am looking to move away from it completely._ "
