    "body": "Hi, here’s a rough description of what I think is going on:\n\nIt looks like the excel parser attempts to convert strings to floats - if all strings in a column can be fully parsed as floats, that column becomes numeric. Determination of whether a string can be converted to a float is done using ‘floatify’ in parse_helper.h. This is in turn implemented using an implementation of strtod (renamed xstrtod) in the same file. From a cursory search it looks like this implementation of strtod comes from Sanos (http://www.jbox.dk/sanos/).\n\nThe issue trigging this failure is that this strtod implementation accepts a complete numeric string with a trailing ‘e’ as the representation of a floating point number. That is, ‘12e’ is parsed as the number 12.0, with no trailing characters. (Because there are no trailing characters, floatify converts the string to a float.) I compared this with the behavior of strtod in my vanilla ubuntu 12 system, and there ’12e’ is parsed as the number 12.0, but with a trailing character ‘e’. Looking at the c-99 spec it appears that in this case treating ‘e’ as a trailing character and not part of the numeric representation is the conforming behavior.\n\nWould it make sense to consider changing the strtod implementation to treat the ‘e’ as a trailing character in this case rather than part of the numerical representation? I haven’t yet investigated how far reaching the consequences of doing this would be, but when I tested the change with a simple patch all of the tests passed.\n"

    "body": "@jreback Digging a little more, it looks like there are two separate copies of xstrtod in the code (in parse_helper.h and tokenizer.c). They seem to have been copied from the same original implementation in Sanos, but in at least one case the may have been patched differently in the pandas code over time. Would it make sense to look into unifying these two xstrtods?\n\nI don't have a strong opinion on whether the functionality requested in this issue warrants a change to xstrtod. But, overall does it make sense to change xstrtod to be \"conforming\" in this dangling 'e' case? (If so, maybe a separate low priority ticket could be filed for this.) From a quick look, currently the version of xstrtod in parse_helper.h is used by parser internals and ObjectBlock.convert. And the version in tokenizer.c is used for a parser.converter.\n"
