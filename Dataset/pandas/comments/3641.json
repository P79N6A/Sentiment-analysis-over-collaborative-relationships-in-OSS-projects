    "body": "I think the concept \"saved with an index\" just doesn't apply to Stata files. For the round trip, sure - but that is probably more of a use case for tests (important enough, but maybe not for the defaults) than anything in real life.\n\nI see two typical cases. \n1. The Stata file does not have anything like an index, or I couldn't care less about it. Say I just want to run OLS regressions and the order does not matter. Reading the file into Pandas, the index should be automatically set to `[0, 1, 2, ...]`. Writing it to Stata again, I really do not want to have Pandas' index saved along with my data. So I'd like to pass an `index=False` attribute to the writer, like for `to_csv`. \n2. The Stata dataset has some variables that clearly are best seen as the index in Pandas (person identifiers, dates, whatever). Ideally, I would like to tell the reader about this immediately rather than setting it ex post, which gives the use case for the `index_col` attribute to the reader. However, these columns I definitely do not want to loose when writing to Stata again. \n\nSo I think the current \"defaults\" (i.e. writer with `index=True` and reader with `index_col=None`) are right, but it would be very useful to add the two options.\n\nLeaves the question of what to do upon writing if the `Index` (or its constituents in case of a `MultiIndex`) does not have a name (required for columns in Stata). I would vote for throwing an error, better be explicit than implicit.\n"
