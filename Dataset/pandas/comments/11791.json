I've read the documentation about this in Pandas and don't actually disagree with it.  I just know that I need to be careful of it.  I think that the better way to do it with series would be the `df.iterrows()` and then have your function deal with the index and `Series`.\n\n@shoyer Your solution sounds like just what I'm looking for.  I guess when they switched to `namedtuples` they also added this parameter since I don't think it was there before.\n\n@MaximilianR I haven't looked into `dill`.  In my research I think I saw that there is a fork of `multiprocessing` that uses dill over pickle.  I don't remember now off the top of my head about that one.  I may look into it some, but @shoyer seems to have a very simple solution.\n\nThanks for the help.  I guess correctly pickling `namedtuples` is beyond the scope of `pandas` library.\n"
