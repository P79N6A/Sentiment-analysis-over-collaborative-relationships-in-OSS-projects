    "body": "> this came from #22019. Do you know if the note is obsolete, or has there been a regression?\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of an intentional change making it obsolete, so I guess it counts as a regression.  That said, the behavior change in this note was a side-effect of #22019, not at all part of the intention.  It looks like the edits that #22019 made in tests.frame.test_axis_select_reindex and tests.reshape.test_pivot are no longer necessary.  I'd say revert those, remove the note, and call it a win."
