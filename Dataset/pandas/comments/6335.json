This is a problem with mixed numeric data since the data is first transformed using the largest data type, including coercing integer types to float if the row contains a float, before bring written.  I can't imagine that a loss of fidelity that this can induce would be desirable.\n\nThis shows what is effectively happening inside `to_stata`:\n\n``` python\nfrom pandas import Series,DataFrame\nimport numpy as np\n\noriginal = np.int64(2**63-2**32)\n\ns1 = Series(original,dtype=np.int64)\ns2 = Series(0.1,dtype=np.float32)\ndf = DataFrame({'long':s1,'single':s2})\n\n# No problem in data frame\nprint df['long']-original\n\n# Coercing int64 to float32 creates  a problem\nprint df.iloc[0]['long'] - original\n```\n"

Casting columns with an attempt to preserve data fidelity at the expense of possibly larger files.  For example, an `int8` with a value of 101 is not upcast to an `int16`, and similarly an `int16` which is valid but outside the range of a Stata variable is upcast to `int32`.  `int64` is now case to either\n   - down to `int32`, if all data is a valid `int32` \n   - sideways to float64, and a warning given if the conversion might be lossy (if the `int64` values i larger than 2**53).  Even this might be lossless, although I don't test these cases.\n3. Removed the `iterrows` and replaced it with `itertuples`.  `itertuples` preserves data types while `iterrows` does not.\n"
