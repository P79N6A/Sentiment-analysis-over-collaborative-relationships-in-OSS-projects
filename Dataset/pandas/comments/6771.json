Is it just my misunderstandings or does this all seems overly complicated? Convenience vs. \"optimized\" code. I'm not sure all those milliseconds I have saved are bigger than the time I've spent on these things.\n\nMultiple periods in a PeriodIndex? Doesn't that defeat the whole purpose?\n"

    "body": "I see. I never even thought of this. I always assume that PeriodIndex is an index of consecutive (missing values allowed) Period types with the frequency correctly defined i.e., you never get monthly periods to represent a quarterly index. If we're given a PeriodIndex of monthly Periods that are supposed to be quarterly, then we (statsmodels) are going to incorrectly extrapolate out of sample.\n\nThe ambiguity is that it's not clear whether you should return monthly or quarterly? I'd argue to return quarterly. The use case being, I want to extrapolate out of sample. The offset should be (inferred to be) quarterly not monthly.\n\nIt makes sense to me not to allow a difference between frequency and offset in `PeriodIndex`. `PeriodIndex` should be the simple beast and `DatetimeIndex` the more general where weirdness is allowed and frequency inference fails no? Maybe people are (ab)using PeriodIndex in that way, but I don't think you should let them. Anarchy!\n"
