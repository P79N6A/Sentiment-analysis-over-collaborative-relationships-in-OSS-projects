    "body": "As in several recent FRs, I'll reiterate that pandas accepts _data_. we do not need to swallow\nup every possible dependeny for data sources and reify it, partially, badly into our exposed API.\nThe maintainer of  ashima/pdf-table-extract seems to have come to the same conclusion.\n\nWe want pandas to make it easy to work with any reasonable data source, that does _not_\nrequire we provide a specialized API for it. \"data, the ultimate data API\" (hello clojure!)\n\nWhere we can provide significantly better workflow or solve a major pain point it's fine to add on\nto pandas. In all cases where it's trivial to compose an existing external library with pandas\nto get work done, users should just do that.\n\nPlease, no more of this \"library X can read Y, you should have X as a dep and add read_Y to the API\",\nunless there's a tangible added benefit that comes out of it.\nThe user is ultimately much more empowered by composing focused tools then by having\nthe LCM of the combination. and the devs are better off not fighting yet another vector for \nmethod signture feature creep. #6029 \n\njust \"use X\".\n"
