    "body": "I know the PR is already merged, but some comments:\n- I agree that this is not worth a toplevel link in the docs index, but I am personally in favor of evolving the docs towards smaller files (so splitting existing files, eg in subfolders) instead of merging them into even larger files than they already are. But this is a little bit a seperate issue as this needs a reorganisation of the docs index (so OK for the PR).\n- About this plotting interface, I think it is not really actively developed/maintained/enhanced by anyone? And given that this functionality is now much better covered in things like seaborn and ggplot, and @jreback called the docs section on this 'not really fleshed out' which is even an understatement I think. Shouldn't we rather deprecate it and eventually remove it from the pandas code base? (instead of promoting it to out main plotting doc page) See also the previous discussion in #3445 and the idea of adding some showcases of seaborn/ggplot/... to our vis docs (I don't directly find where this was dicussed recently)\n"
