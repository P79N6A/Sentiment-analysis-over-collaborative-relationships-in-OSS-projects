So, to do this in rpy2, the idea would be to make pandas2ri.activate() set up better conversion in the dynamically patched ri2ro function.\n\nI actually opened up an issue about this, as my memory was that things were better than they currently are! I haven't had time to go digging though:\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/lgautier/rpy2/issue/206/numpy2ri-pandas2ri-no-longer-properly\n\nFor what it's worth, I think if we have pandas installed (and invoke pandas2ri.activate()), a pandas.Series is a much better choice for conversion of R lists and vectors than a numpy object, as you get a proper index.\n"

    "body": "Maybe interface and conversion logic should be discussed separately.\n\n#### Conversion Functions\n\nCurrently pandas conversion looks better for me. I agree it should be merged in the future, and it should be decided on which module the conversion function maintained. I think the conversion more rely on the type of `Index` and pandas version, thus it may better to hold the conversion logic on pandas and call it from `rpy2` ?\n\n#### Conversion Interface\n\nIn my use case, sometimes I want to handle `rpy2` raw values otherwise want automatic conversion. As `pandas2ri` overwrites all the `rpy2` default conversion func, I have to `activate` and `deactivate` every time based on my operation to do this. Thus I prefer pandas `r` to be wrapped to perform automatic conversion, and I think it is natural.\n"

    "body": "Saw this question was unanswered while checking into another issue. It should be noted that @lgautier fixed an issue with already existing code to convert pandas DataFrames automatically into rpy2 wrapped function calls.\n\nThe logic for the direction rpy2 has moved is that conversion to (other) python objects has been deprecated in favor of rpy2 proxy objects (wrapped R objects) supporting the array interface so numpy calls work directly on rpy2.robjects objects. And if you want a true `numpy.array`, you can just use `numpy.asarray`.\n\nIt's less obvious how to do that in pandas as there's nothing equivalent to the standard array / buffer API for tables of data.\n\nThe other piece is that we've been talking about moving to a generics approach to handling conversion on the rpy2 end in the future.\n\nSo, that's the state of things on the rpy2 side. Probably in any case it's good to have the code that inspects the guts of R objects live in rpy2. If folks want to coordinate, that'd be great. In particular, no one has asked for anything on the rpy2 side, right?\n"

So in fact, that is asking something on the rpy2 side, as the current conversion functions in rpy2 are lacking in some ways and should be improved if we decide that it should live in rpy2 (or at least accepting PRs).\n\n@sinhrks I think you could also say the conversion depends more on the internals of the rpy2 objects and so rpy2 version, and should only use public pandas API. But if more contributors of pandas are interested in keeping this up to date, it is maybe easier to do it here.\n\n@davclark What do you think of the conversion interface issue raised by @sinhrks above? \n"

    "body": "The functionality of `rpy2.pandas2ri.activate()` should remain about the same. The infrastructure that supports should become more robust and extensible via generics. This not-yet-implemented generic system would be a good place for pandas code to modify conversion to and from R.\n\nMy feeling is that advanced users like @sinhrks would be better served by using the conversion functions directly (`pandas2ri.pandas2ri()` and `pandas2ri.ri2pandas()`), rather than activating and deactivating (i.e., swapping functions assigned to a given symbol). Note that there is no longer a general ri2py, as one can use ri2ro to get an object that supports the array interface. From there, it is easy to do `numpy.asarray()`. However, it seems maybe ri2py should come back if there is strong demand.\n\n@sinhrks - is there a reason that simply using the functions directly doesn't work for you?\n\nCan someone provide a conceptual diff on those `pandas2ri` functions with the `pandas.rpy`. I know there are things I'd like to see in rpy2: for example, by adding multi-index support (it's not clear what the right way to do this is!). I'm not sure why a `pandas.Series` should be a `data.frame` in R as R vectors and lists have `names()`.\n\n@jorisvandenbossche, sorry if I came across as snarky. Does someone want to provide a PR against rpy2? We had a strange `default` branch for a while, but it's been rebased onto the 2.4.x branch, and is now targeting a 2.5.x release. So `default` is a good place to start (equivalent of `master` on git). Or, an answer to the above \"conceptual diff\" (or issues on the rpy2 issue tracker) would be enough to get us going in the right direction.\n"

You just have to make your own conversion logic and register it.\n\nShould you want to have you own conversion rules that disregards existing conversion, this is also possible. As a module owner you can decide on the way it should be done: this is between you and your users. In the present case, may be worth considering looking at how the existing conversion in `rpy2` could address your needs, and suggest changes where it does not.\n\nThe case of explicitly parallel and active conversion rules is not very well addressed by the current design in rpy2 (as it is using the fact that imported modules are singletons, and the active conversion is always at `rpy2.robjects.conversion.<function>`.  \n"

    "body": "Just to touch base, I'm spending some time with @mrocklin thinking about how to do general conversion. He and some folks at Continuum are working on a project you've likely heard of called blaze, which in particular contains a simple conversion system called [into](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/blaze/blob/master/blaze/api/into.py) that exercises @mrocklin's multiple dispatch mechanism. There's a related package called dynd, which we're looking at as a way to handle sensible handling of things like missing data for conversion to R. We're also discussing difficulties that arise with multi-indices.\n\nBut he seems willing to break out into as a separate project, and this could perhaps be a way to coordinate conversion between data-frame (and other) packages like pytables, pandas, R, SQL, etc.\n\nIn any case, I'd _still_ love to hear a bit more about what kind of API people would like to see.\n"
