Otherwise if joining indexes on indexes or indexes on a column or\r\ncolumns, the index will be passed on.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suspect this comes from trying to support two use-cases: meaningful and non-meaningful indexes. In this case, your index is meaningful, so you're hoping to have it be present, even when merging on just columns.\r\n\r\nIn many cases (especially for people coming from SQL), people don't have meaningful indexes, and would be surprised to not have a `range(n)` index after performing a  merge.\r\n\r\nMake sense?"
