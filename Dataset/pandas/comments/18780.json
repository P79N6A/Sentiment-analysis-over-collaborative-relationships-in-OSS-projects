At the moment this is probably not a problem, as neither of those build against gdal or geos. \r\nBut, shortly I hope, `geopandas` will start having geos as a build dependency, and then this mixing is probably more problematic. It is also a bit annoying to do the install to get the channel priority correct (but which is probably not a problem for our CI)\r\n\r\nAnyhow, reading a simple shapefile is working fine."
