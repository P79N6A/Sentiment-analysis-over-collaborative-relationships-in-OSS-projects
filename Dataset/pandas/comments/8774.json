    "body": "Thx for the link, this is indeed the same issue, hope others will agree with us that \"D\" should be != \"24H\". They always have had the same semantic, but in previous pandas versions \"D\" and \"24H\" meant true 24 hours intervals: one just had to accept that \"D\" was exactly 24 hours to make sense of date_range behavior. Now with pandas 0.15.0, \"D\" and \"24H\" stand for \"calendar daily\" frequencies and it is harder to think of \"24H\" as a \"calendar day\" which can have 23, 24 or 25 hours. \n"
