E.g. if the column already exists, then you can set it via attribute access and will still be a column\n\ne.g.\n\n```\nIn [5]: dat.a = dat.a + 2\n\nIn [6]: dat\nOut[6]: \n   a  b\n0  3  4\n1  4  5\n2  5  6\n```\n\nHowever it will not set a new column. The docs don't really point this out.\n\nI think the point was that the user could set meta data if they wanted and it won't automatically become a column.\n"
