    "body": "this is a bit tricker than it looks. pandas correctly handles boxing of dtypes (e.g. to Timestamp/categorical and such). So this is really just `list(self)`. I suppose you could box integer/floats. Though IMHO this is a pretty useless method and really just for numpy compat.\n\nIf you'd like to do a pull-request would prob accept.\n\nyou should simply use `.to_json()`\n"
