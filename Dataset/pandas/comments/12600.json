    "body": "this is the same issue as in #12238 and solved for `np.searchsorted` in #12413 by @gfyoung \n\nThe issue is numpy insists on call with positional arguments a 'sub-class' method, even though we are duck like, to implement things like this, which is fine. but its just not very friendlty. \n\nso we need to accept (but not advertise the `out`) arg (which was taken out in 0.18.0).\n\nseparately, @gfyoung I think numpy should have a `try: except:` around `_wrap_it` to guard against things like this.\n"

    "body": "Are we having problem with this bug as well? On my computer with the latest Anaconda, win7 it works fine. But on a collegue's, we started getting `error numpy round() takes at most 2 arguments (3 given)` when he installed the latest version.\n\nthis for example works for me, but not for him\n\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\na = [1.23, 1.33]\nprint np.round(pd.Series(a), 1)\n```\n\nAs a work-around, making below change solved it, but I do not know if I have broken something else.

Perhaps this works for you if you're never sending the result to another array `out`, but universally, this will not work I'm afraid because it modifies a library that we have no control over for all intensive purposes.\n"
