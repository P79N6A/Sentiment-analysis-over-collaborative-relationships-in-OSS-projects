    "body": "Yes, I put it here rather than on that PR (again), so I don't have to mention it anymore.\n\nThe main reason for doing this is to take advantage of git and not have to repeat yourself, since it provides most of the tools you need, and can actually force you to follow a maintenance workflow (Fernando convinced us of this and his messages are on MLs, so I won't repeat.)\n\nThese tools produce some autogenerated content that you can source in your hand-written release notes, which would contain information about things that really should be highlighted with examples and more information. The automated stuff is good for small enhancements and bug fixes mostly\n\nWhen merging PRs, the onus would be on the maintainer who does the merge (and reviews and understands the code) to provide a useful merge commit message with the understanding that it will go into the overview automatic release documentation and keep the git log nice. There's also a link automatically to the merge commit / PR and the docs.\n\nPeople on the bleeding edge can always click on the milestone and closed PRs on github to see if they want to upgrade, but yes you'll lose some of the continual updates unless you make a cron job to run this or something, but you'd still have the big highlights in the handmade release notes.\n"

    "body": "Here's what I'm proposing. \n- Every change goes through a PR. No pushing to master, so everything ends up in the full change log. \n- The PR author only needs to touch release notes for substantial changes.\n- The person who merges essentially makes the change log through adding a useful summary in the merge commit messages (no fast-forward merges).\n\nThe richness and completeness of the change log is unaffected. The only difference is that you have a main release notes page with everything users really care about that contains a link to the full changes with all of the little niggly changes and minor bug-fixes. (Or you could just use an include directive to keep it on the same page).\n\nYou could keep a continuous change log or not. \n\nWhy it's not a big deal to lose it: this is what `git log` is for so why duplicate it? People that are thinking about upgrading to the bleeding edge are already comfortable with git. Plus now the merge commits are all there in the log and can be reviewed and the big changes are in the online docs. \n\nTo keep it: if you want to keep them, then you add a call to the docs generation in the same thing that pushes the nightly doc builds. And have an include directive in the manual docs. No clobbering involved.\n"
