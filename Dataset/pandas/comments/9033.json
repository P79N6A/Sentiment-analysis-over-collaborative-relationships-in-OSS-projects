    "body": "I think this change should be considered **very very very** carefully.  It is a gigantic change to the API.  It means that any later additions of new methods or attributes to DataFrame may unexpectedly break tons of code.  For instance, if I have code that does `df.blah = 5`, and we later add a method or attribute called `blah`, my code will now overwrite that attribute.  Allowing quick attribute access for _reads_ is very different, because even if we add a `blah` method, code that does `df.blah` will not modify the object.  I think it would be wise not to into changes like this that not only change behavior, but have major implications for any and all future changes to the DataFrame API.\n"

    "body": "Personally, this would break my library as attribute setting is hacked in.  I'm not sure if it would affect GeoPandas, since they have honest-to-goodness dataframe subclasses, and I'm using composite classes.   Not that I think this should hold you back from a major release, but personally I'm not a fan of this behavior.  The attribute setting syntax is pretty consistent throughout Python, and it's not really that difficult to do `df['C'] = 50`.  If anything, maybe raise a warning when trying to set the attribute?\n\nIf you do put this through, can you do a small writeup about how to use the `_finalize_` method as you mentioned?  \n"
