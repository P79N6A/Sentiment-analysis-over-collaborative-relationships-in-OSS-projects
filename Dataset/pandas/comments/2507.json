    "body": "you're completely right about the context manager, will do.\n\nDon't see the upside for doing item magic: \n- not more concise\n- no tooltip in ipython\n- doesn't have room for expressing  reset/describe\n- too many ways to do the same thing \n\nat least doing `pd.options.print.max_cols` would get you tab-completion  \nand express the hirerchy of keys in a natural way.\n\nUnless it's really that annoying for everyone, I suggest leaving as is.\n"
