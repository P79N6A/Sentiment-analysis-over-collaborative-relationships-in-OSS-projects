    "body": "@rockg a couple of suggestions / comments\n- use `rule_table`, rather than `_rule_table`. Its not internal, so not necessary\n- I would have a name attribute for the `AbstractHolidayCalendar` (settable in the constructor, defautling to the class name). \n- since you end up having lots of calendars (well I DO!, different countries and such), you need a nice way to access them, maybe have a `get_calendar(name=....)` module level function (which could look up the `globals()`, or you could also register classes in a module level dict by their names (or both)\n- I think you may need an explicit method to pull in holiday rules from another class (rather than using multiple base classes). maybe `calendar1.merge(calendar2)`? The reason is that you may need to have a well-defined ordering for adding rules.\n- I have a concept of a holiday type (e.g. July 4th is an observed day, while July 3rd is _sometimes_ a half-day holiday, depending on when it falls, and Veterans days is a Bank holiday). If these get merged (or subclassed together), they need an attribute to differentiate them. Not sure how to handle this, as what this really is is a congolomeration of 3 different calendars. Hmm. maybe too complicated for here.\n"

    "body": "I think it depends on the type of holiday (fixed date--July 4th--versus floating date--Memorial Day).  I think fixed date half days belong in the observance rule, but floating date half days belong in the offset.  \n\nFor example, the Friday after Thanksgiving would be an offset `DateOffset(TH(4))+DateOffset(1)+Hour(13)`.  And other holidays, like July 3rd would be an observance, for example:\n\n```\ndef WeekdayHalfDay(dt):\n   if dt.isoweekday() < 6:\n       return dt + Hour(13)\n   else:\n       return None\nHoliday('July 3rd Half Day', month=7, day=3, observance=WeekdayHalfDay)\n```\n\nor it can just be in July 4th's observance rule to return a list of dates.\n\nSome changes would need to happen to accept None or a list return from an observance rule, but these are trivial.\n\nTo me the time would be the best way to represent such a thing unless you added an indicator and returned a Series/DataFrame with such information but that seems overkill.  I'm assuming this would just be in timeseries analysis as I don't believe CustomBusinessDays can handle half days and I don't know what that means in a daily context.\n"
