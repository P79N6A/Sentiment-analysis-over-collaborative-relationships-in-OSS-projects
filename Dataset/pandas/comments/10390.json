    "body": "Hello! Hijacking this issue as I've also verified this behaviour (actually, it took a while to discover after upgrading to 0.19.0 and discovering some odd dropping of timezones - see #14524, which is a duplication of #13905). This behaviour was masked to my program previously as Pandas 0.18.1 was dropping the timezones from all relevant columns before I tried to perform this step. Once upgrading to 0.19.0 half the operations I was performing stopped dropping timezones, leading to mismatch between tz-aware and tz-naive timestamps which I've been chasing down the rabbit hole for a couple of days now.\n\nI've verified that this is present in pandas 0.18.1 and 0.19.0.\n\nFrom some stepping through of the code, this looks like a potential problem with the numpy implementations of `.max(axis=1)`, but I haven't yet found the culprit!\n\nThis issue has meant that I've been forced to roll back to 0.18.1 to use the drop timezone bug in order to make the `df.max(axis=1)` work, which is frustrating! I have also tried a `df.T.max()` to work around the issue, but this infuriatingly returns an empty series (see below). \n\n#### A small, complete example of the issue\n\n``` python\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.DataFrame(pd.date_range(start=pd.Timestamp('2016-01-01 00:00:00+00'), end=pd.Timestamp('2016-01-01 23:59:59+00'), freq='H'))\ndf.columns = ['a']\n\ndf['b'] = df.a.subtract(pd.Timedelta(seconds=60*60)) # if using pandas 0.19.0 to test, ensure that this is a series of timedeltas instead of a single - we want b and c to be tz-naive.\n\ndf[['a', 'b']].max() # This is fine, produces two numbers\n\ndf[['a', 'b']].max(axis=1) # This is not fine, produces a correctly sized series of NaN\n\ndf['c'] = df.a.subtract(pd.Timedelta(seconds=60)) # if using pandas 0.19.0 to test, ensure that this is a series of timedeltas instead of a single - we want b and c to be tz-naive.\n\ndf[['b', 'c']].max(axis=1) # This is fine, produces correctly sized series of valid timestamps without timezone\n\ndf[['a', 'b']].T.max() # produces an empty series.\n```\n\n#### Expected Output\n\nCalling  `df.max(axis=1)` on a dataframe with timezone-aware timestamps should return valid timestamps, not NaN.\n\n#### Output of `pd.show_versions()`\n\n(I have tested in two virtualenvs, the only difference between the two being the pandas version)\n\n<details>\n\n# Paste the output here\n\n## INSTALLED VERSIONS\n\ncommit: None\npython: 2.7.10.final.0\npython-bits: 64\nOS: Darwin\nOS-release: 14.5.0\nmachine: x86_64\nprocessor: i386\nbyteorder: little\nLC_ALL: None\nLANG: en_GB.UTF-8\nLOCALE: None.None\n\npandas: 0.18.1\nnose: 1.3.7\npip: 8.1.2\nsetuptools: 28.6.0\nCython: None\nnumpy: 1.11.2\nscipy: None\nstatsmodels: None\nxarray: None\nIPython: None\nsphinx: None\npatsy: None\ndateutil: 2.5.3\npytz: 2016.7\nblosc: None\nbottleneck: None\ntables: None\nnumexpr: None\nmatplotlib: None\nopenpyxl: None\nxlrd: None\nxlwt: None\nxlsxwriter: None\nlxml: None\nbs4: None\nhtml5lib: None\nhttplib2: None\napiclient: None\nsqlalchemy: None\npymysql: None\npsycopg2: None\njinja2: None\nboto: None\npandas_datareader: None\n\n</details>\n"
