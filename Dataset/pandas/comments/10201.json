    "body": "Ahh .. my apologies -- got this example from http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.htmlat. Removing `diff()` corrects the problem I was having. \n\nWhat I had been attempting to do was plot several histograms against each other in the same plot-space so as to examine overlap, with a view to establishing the worth of creating distributions using max likelihood. The pandas.plot(kind='hist') doesn't seem to be able to do this so went to the option of multiple plots, an adequate work around. So the example I pasted to do this was: \n`In [27]: df.diff().hist(color='k', alpha=0.5, bins=50)`\n\nCouldn't paste images from Ipynb to here sorry. Thank you for pointing the error out -- just a suggestion for less skilled, like myself, maybe change the example by removing the diff(). \nAlso, this function is what I will now use to allow  multiple comparisons. (My humble attempt to fix as well as raise issues).\n\n``` python\ndef Hist_plot(column_list, bins=10, color=['green','blue'],alpha=.3):\n    '''This plots a list of series, obtained from columns\n    column_list is, for example, [df.colA ,df.colB,df.colC]\n    Default colors = ['green','blue']'''\n    fig = plt.figure()\n    ax = fig.add_subplot(111)\n    x = column_list\n    bins=bins \n    ax.hist(x,numBins,color=color,alpha=alpha)\n    plt.show()\nHist_plot([df.colA,df.colB])\n```\n"
