Now there are, if we want there is an option to change that, but for me this is OK (it's a little more crowdier, but it's what users also see in there console).\n- regarding the io.rst / unicode issue: \n  - it builds without error on windows!\n  - however, the output in the html is not yet good (I get such questionmarks), although this is less important. I am a complete encoding noob, so I don't really understand the reasoning of your changes, but this commit (https://github.com/y-p/pandas/commit/a9b0ef5388ba68f450667e89c04c0a15f297089a) doesn't matter (doesn't change anything in the output/building). \n- `okexcept` is working fine, errors in code are sent to console\n- no warnings anymore! thanks to the moving of the template (well, there were 7 warnings, but all related to references to the deleted api.rst)\n\nSo as long you don't forget to put back the api docs before merging, this is looking good.\n"

    "body": "Twice, I told myself twice to remember to get rid of that commit before pushing. _sigh_\n\nThe coloring and Out prompts are not intentional but no harm I guess, would rather move on.\nThe question marks are due to using `decode(foo, errors='replace')` which always succeds and returns\nunicode. \nI'm still unclear about the unicode issue. The current docs contain a string which is not valid utf8 \nand I fully expected that to create all kinds of trouble, not sure why it doesn't.\n\nI'll give the unicode bit another look, I was sure the issue was solvable. Am still holding out \nfor some of this to get  merged upstream into ipython.\n\nThanks.\n"
