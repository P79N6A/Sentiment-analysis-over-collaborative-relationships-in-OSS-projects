    "body": "I've made some progress on this. As mentioned above, the C engine is silently failing over to python in the case of a regexp separator (and several other cases). Consequently options specific to the C parser (`dtype`, `skip_footer`...) are silently ignored. I see several ways to proceed:\n1. Add warnings when failing over to python, but otherwise leave things the way they are. The `converters` option is already supported by python and can accomplish almost the same thing as `dtype`. (could even alias `dtype`->`converters`, although this is probably bad because they aren't exactly the same thing)\n2. Raise an error when failing over to python and C-specific options are specified. This breaks several tests in io/tests/test_parsers.py which rely on silent failover to python.\n3. Modify the python parser code to handle `dtype` correctly. This is beyond what I understand how to do right now given the complications of treating NA values.\n\n(I'm also thinking it might be nice to alias `sep='\\s+'` to `delim_whitespace=True` to handle this common case in the C parser...)\n\nSo far I've made some progress on (2), but am having second thoughts about whether this is the best way to go. Would appreciate any advice.\n"

    "body": "OK, all of the tests are passing except for several that cause an issue with the C parser:\n\n`test_read_table_buglet_4x_multiindex` (test_parsers.ParserTests)\n`test_round_trip_frame` (test_clipboard.TestClipboard)\n`test_round_trip_frame_string` (test_clipboard.TestClipboard)\n\nThe failures seem to be caused by the C parser adding an extra column when lines begin with spaces. For example\n\n``` python\nIn [3]: data = ' a b c\\n 1 2 3\\n 4 5 6'\n\nIn [4]: pd.read_table(StringIO(data), engine='c', delim_whitespace=True)\nOut[4]: \n   Unnamed: 0  a  b  c\n0         NaN  1  2  3\n1         NaN  4  5  6\n\n[2 rows x 4 columns]\n```\n\nPreviously these tests fell back to the python parser (due to `sep='\\s+'` being passed) which correctly ignores leading spaces:\n\n``` python\nIn [5]: pd.read_table(StringIO(data), engine='python', sep='\\s+')\nOut[5]: \n   a  b  c\n0  1  2  3\n1  4  5  6\n\n[2 rows x 3 columns]\n```\n"
