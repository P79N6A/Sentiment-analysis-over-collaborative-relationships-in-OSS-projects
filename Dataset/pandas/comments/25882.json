    "body": "@WillAyd I've been studying a few of these files and related contributions today and was wondering if there are any catches I need to know about when fixing these mypy violations. \r\nAs an example: in array_.py:231 adding dtype = cast(ExtensionDtype, dtype)\" seems the least intrusive. However, I saw that typing was [added to this file partially already](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/25829/files) , so was there a specific reason to leave this violation in? Thanks a lot!

    "body": "@WillAyd I've run into a few cases where we should use an old style type hint for a global variable to maintain pre-3.6 compatibility, but the appropriate hint is just too long for the line. I haven't been able to find any documented way to break a variable's type hint across lines or put it on another line. \r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nFor example in pandas/compat/numpy/function.py:105 we want something like \r\n```py\r\nARGSORT_DEFAULTS = OrderedDict()  # type: OrderedDict[str, Union[int, str, None]]\r\n```\r\nbut that line is too long. We could replace the `Union` with `Any`, but that reduces the usefulness of type checking. In this particular case, it probably doesn't matter because that ARGSORT_DEFAULTS  gets fed directly into a classconstructor and is never touched again. But there may be other places in the code where accuracy is more important and the line length is an issue."
