    "body": "@jreback : I recall seeing that mentioned somewhere, but can't find a corresponding issue.  Do you happen to know where it is?\r\n\r\nAlso, would adding this method still be worthwhile if inheritance is implemented?  Maybe if someone wanted to add a non-compatible `Interval` to a `PeriodIndex`, they'd need convert to `IntervalIndex` first?  Not sure how common/useful that would be.  Might just close this if there's no clear benefit to having this in addition to inheritance."
