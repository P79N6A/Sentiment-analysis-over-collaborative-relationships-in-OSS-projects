Without a dataset, we cannot reproduce your issue (especially on a codebase of this size).\r\n\r\nClosing for now, but if you have time, I recommend you try to recreate a dataset with the same shape and data types as the one you have and see if you can still reproduce.  If you are able, please ping, and we can revisit!"
