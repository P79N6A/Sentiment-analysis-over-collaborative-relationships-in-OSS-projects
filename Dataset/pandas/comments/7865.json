    "body": "I think it is mainly on my comments there (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/7849#issuecomment-50393123):\n\n> I was just wondering if the focus is a bit too much on Anaconda? I myself also use it, and I would also recommend this personally to others, but as 'pandas' we should maybe be a bit more neutral. As there are also other 'distributions' that you can use to get the full scipy/pydata stack (enthought canopy, pythonxy, ..).\n> Maybe we should do more something like on http://www.scipy.org/install.html: list some different scientific python distributions, and then we can still elaborate more on how to use it with Anaconda?\n> \n> On the 'neutrality' issue, I agree we should provide clear and easy instruction (and therefore, we (should) also recommenend to use distributions instead of installing it manually (as now with your PR)).\n> But you have also the other side: eg Enthought also has done a lot for the numpy/scipy community, and they maybe would appreciate it we list them (in fact, they are mentioned now, at the end of the dependencies section). @jreback @cpcloud What do you think?\n"
