It's in general unpredictable and considered bad practice. \r\n\r\nIn general, `apply` functions are not intended to modify in place the thing on which they are applied. The established pattern is:\r\n\r\n`newthing = thing.apply(func)`\r\n\r\nif you want to sort a column you assign the sorted version back to itself:\r\n\r\n`col = col.apply(sort)`\r\n\r\nSimilarly, here you should not sort the group in place but return a the sorted group as a new object.\r\n\r\nThe [documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html#flexible-apply) gives a warning that `apply()` calls the function twice as a consequence of speed optimization and warns you to not do anything that would have side effects. The behavior you're seeing here is a result of that. "
