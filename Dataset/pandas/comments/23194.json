Didn't really want to steal @dubielt1's first PR.\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand his idea is using `DocTestParser` to get the tests into `pycodestyle`. \r\nWe've done basically the same (`examples_source_code()` to get the tests, but `flake8` which includes `pycodestyle` for generating the issues). \r\n "
