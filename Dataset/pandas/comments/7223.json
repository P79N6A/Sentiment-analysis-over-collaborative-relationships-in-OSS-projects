    "body": "I don't think this is _exactly_ the same as #3004 or #7873.\n1. The other issues are about finding the nearest time, not nearest datetime.\n2. More generally, I would find a `index.nearest()` method useful for `Float64Index` as well as `DatetimeIndex`. Looking up nearest neighbors is a pretty common operation so it would be nice to have a shortcut for it.\n"
