    "body": "`df.mad()` is equivalent to `abs(df - df.mean()).mean()`, which is much more explicit and obvious. Likewise, `abs(df - df.median()).mean()` would probably be better than `df.mad(how='median')` (note that from a performance perspective these are equivalent). I'm not entirely sure we really even need a separate `.mad()` method, though at this point I suppose there's little to gain from deprecating it.\n"
