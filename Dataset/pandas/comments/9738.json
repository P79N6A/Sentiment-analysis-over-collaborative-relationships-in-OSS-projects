I can see some merit in this, but I'm generally not a big fan of warnings.\n\nI believe @jreback has been exploring using dynd to support true integer NA in pandas, which would be the clean solution here.\n\n> I would also like to suggest converting to object over converting to float if nans are being produced.

    "body": "@amcpherson datatypes change in intelligent ways. The current implementation of integers cannot support NA, so this is unavoidable ATM. much older versions of pandas and numpy will just silently do things (and not even change the dtype). So you don't lose data. I don't think this is a big deal at all; its a fact of life when performing operations.\n\nA pull-request to implement an optional warning would be ok. To be honest I have not seen a request that pandas 'takes chaning the datatype of a column too lightly'. In fact every issue I have come across (and I have looked at these issues for several years) was exactly the opposite. Users want correctness first, don't want conversion to `object` and want operations that just work. An occasional int->float is generally IMHO not a big deal. my 2c. of course. \n\nIf you don't want this type of casting, then a nice solution is to use Categoricals where these types of operations are simply not allowed.\n"
