(Though timezones are much more volatile than the trading calendar.) I may continue some work on that path in the short term, since I currently have a few scripts that do not need all of Zipline, but do need the calendar with support for half days. If there is interest there, conversation can be carried over to the tradingcalendar GitHub repo.\n\nOr those libraries could be used as a base to upstream a Holiday calendar to pandas, to that end I can help assign copyright and figure out re-licensing, and contribute some coding it looks like https://github.com/pydata/pandas/blob/master/pandas/tseries/holiday.py with a NYSE version of USFederalHolidayCalendar, but for our code to use it, we would need to add half day support. The NYSE calendar would be easiest since it's work was done wholly by Quantopian employees, whereas non-NYSE calendars, like the Toronto exchange were provided by community members.\n\nApologies to pandas maintainers if this discussion is trampling too much, and let me know if we should move the discussion off list, but hoping that sharing the rules we've been using is beneficial to everyone.\n"

I would maintain these prob using .py files (with tests!) in an organized way, registering to the pandas holiday module on import (its possible pandas can provide an easier/better method for this).\n\nEasy enough for people to clone the repo and just import these files.\n\nThen this can be updated pretty easily by multiple groups and it is not subject to pandas release schedule.\n"
