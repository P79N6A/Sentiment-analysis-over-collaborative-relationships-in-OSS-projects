    "body": "i don't think it is that useful and maybe this bug is even a bit academic, lmk if u think this not worth fixing. these kinds of bugs are notoriously difficult because the code path to the cycle has the potential to be _enormous_. thankfully, i just discovered the cycle, and it's not that long. i believe the problem is that object datetime indices are not being converted to datetime indices and thus `self` and `other` dtype keep testing as not equal ad infinitum. \n\nanother way to see it is that periodindexes should be kept as object here and thus the dtypes will test equal on the next recursive call and the code will terminate.\n\neither way if the dtypes are not equal the code attempts conversion to object but the `__new__` method intercepts and periodindexes always get constructed as periodindexes then join is called recursively and never finishes\n"
