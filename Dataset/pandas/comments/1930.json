    "body": "3 obvious extensions to this:\n1. allow a class method on NDFrame to set/reset axis properties (e.g. set all of the _AXIS_\\* stuff, and recreate the axes) - essentially a way to rename (or provide alias) for different axes - e.g. instead of label,items,major_axis,minor_axis, could use latitude,longitue,altitude,time for example - should be straightforward to do this\n2. could rename FDPanel -> Panel4D to be consistent, create Panel5D (5th dimension could be called by default ???)\n3. a ND class creator - take an existing class and add a dimension to it  \n   e.g. to create Panel4D I could do something like:\n   `Panel4D = NDCreator(Panel, axes = ['labels','items','major_axis','minor_axis'])`  \n   Panel5D then is trivial e.g.\n   `Panel5D = NDCreator(Panel4D, axes = ['high_dim','labels','items','major_axis','minor_axis'])`  \n   \n   Of course this is whole exercise is non-trivial:\n   - a higher dimensional object is not so easily specified, as the plane/join axes need to be computed (which I think could be done automagically)\n   - this new object needs to be inserted in the indexing.py (thinking multi_take here) - but I think this could also be handled by changing multi_take to inquire to the object if it can handle this.....could get a bit tricky)\n   - the constructor_slice needs to be created properly (e.g. in order to create a Panel5D, you have to have a Panel4D, which in turn requires a _compatible_ Panel - e.g. same labels/alias for sliced objects) \n"
