I've been using `xray` to handle most of my netCDF I/O and the `xray.Dataset.to_pandas()` method has been meeting all my needs in terms of reading netCDF data into `Pandas` data types.  I'm not sure I see much benefit in building a separate netCDF reader for `Pandas` given the functionality that `xray` provides.  \n"

    "body": "To add to what @jhamman writes, NetCDF is a highly structured data format that isn't a great fit for existing pandas data structures, except in some special cases. This would be a little different if we had working nd panels, but you'd still end up reading a netcdf file into a dict of nd panels -- pretty ugly and not very useable. Pandas itself is never going to have the right data structures for netcdf.\n\nThis is, of course, the motivation for why I wrote xray. I'm not saying xray is the end all solution here, but it does add no additional dependencies (beyond itself and a library to read netcdf files) and makes it quite straightforward to read netcdf into pandas, with explicit choices about how to handle edge cases along the way. That's all you could hope for from an implementation in pandas itself. \n"
