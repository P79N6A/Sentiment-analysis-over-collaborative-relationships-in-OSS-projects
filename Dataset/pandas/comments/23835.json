    "body": "> Also, the travis tests are calling ./ci/code_checks.sh with no parameters so nothing is happening there.\r\n\r\n@JustinZhengBC : Actually that's not the case.  We set `LINT=1` for the build's environment configuration.  That being said, your point is well taken, and I think it goes along the lines of the fact that we need a separate script for contributors to sanity-check their code for style errors.\r\n\r\n@datapythonista : I don't remember which issue had the discussion about adding a contributor-specific style check script.  If there is one, I think this issue would certainly be a good argument for having one."

    "body": "Thanks for reporting this @JustinZhengBC. The requirement for setting the env variable `LINT=1` is removed in #22854, which hopefully is merged very soon. As @gfyoung, at the moment there is one build in travis that is setting it, so the lining is run once in the CI. If you open a PR with pep8 errors you will know which build it is. :)\r\n\r\nIf I remember correctly, I intentionally didn't add the `LINT=1` to the docs, as I expected it to be removed before anybody checked that. And because I think the error message is good enough, so anyone trying to run the linting, should be able to know how easily.\r\n\r\nI'll close this, as I think this will be fixed when #22854, but feel free to reopen it, if there is anything that I'm missing."
