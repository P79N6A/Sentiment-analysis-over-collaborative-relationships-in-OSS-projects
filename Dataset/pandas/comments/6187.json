    "body": "Given that non-library code didn't change between two runs, I suppose I could go through the profiles and check cumtime of public API functions to look for the places where they were called, if that's of any help... But that won't happen until weekend and which of the upcoming weekends would it be is an open question, sorry about that.\n\nAs for the suite, well, I do see the run time go up after changing to an environment that only differs in `pandas` version in a reproducible manner and the difference doesn't fit to my definition of statistical error (4mins vs 6mins). Given the number of _wtf_ situations I had in the past with `pandas` I think that I somehow use it far from the situation for which it's been tailored and it's unlikely but possible that my cases just aren't covered by the suite. On the other hand I do share your concerns about usefulness of this report, so feel free to close the issue if you like. \n"

I mean I could do `pd.Series(df.values.dot(s1.values), index=df.index)`, but that's exactly what I'm trying to avoid using pandas: manual label management.\n"

There's still a dataset that is split to about several thousand blocks each of which is processed separately and small things, like Series.dot and Series.where, add up to ~50% of slowdown on master branch. I'm inclined to close this ticket, because there seems to be no _big_ gain potential here and tracking down small issues is not worth the while due to all the loose ends in internal APIs.\n\n@hayd it still seems that `Series.dot` and `Series.where` are systematically slower than before.
