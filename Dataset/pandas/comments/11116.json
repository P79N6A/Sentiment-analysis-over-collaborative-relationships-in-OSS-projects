    "body": "@AmbroseKeith thanks for the report. I changed to title to be more helpful than \"utterly broken\"\n\n@jreback I think there's two bugs here. First the multiple dtypes, where the bools are getting mixed in with the Datetime block and getting coerced to NaN. At least that's my guess.\n\nThe last example, `.convert_objects(coerce=True)` shouldn't do anything right? Since datetime, numeric and timedelta are all False? btw @AmbroseKeith I don't think that does what you want (once we fix the bug). You want `.convert_objects(datetime=True, coerce=True)`.\n"

    "body": "This looks correct to me. You asked it to take an `object` column and force convert. Not sure what else you would return here. Bools are nothing special.\n\n```\nIn [17]: df.convert_objects(coerce=True)\nOut[17]: \n          foo  bar\n0  2015-09-14    1\n1  2015-09-15  NaN\n```\n\n`df.convert_objects('coerce')`  could be caught as 'coerce' to `datetime` is invalid (though IIRC this was accept to provide back-compat).\n\nIn general expecting force converting to work always is simply user-error. It is impossible to guess things reliably (and this is why this was changed). If you have dates, use `pd.to_datetime`. `.convert_objects` has really a simple purpose, and that is to force convert mixed values in a known type.\n\nApplying this on a `DataFrame` is quite dangerous and requires much guessing. Not sure what we could do about this.\n"
