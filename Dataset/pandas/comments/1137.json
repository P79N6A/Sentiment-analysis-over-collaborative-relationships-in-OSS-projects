    "body": "This appears to be a bug that was fixed in 1.6.1-- `np.where` should return a regular ndarray in this case. As pandas 0.8.0 will only support 1.6.1 or greater I unfortunately have to close this issue. If you can come up with a fix for this problem on 0.7.3 I'll happily commit a fix in maintenance/0.7.x \n"
