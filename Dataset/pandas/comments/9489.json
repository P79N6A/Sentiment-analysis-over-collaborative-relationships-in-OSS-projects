    "body": "There is logic in place to see if a UDF mutates the passed in frame. If it does not then the results of the groupby can be done in a different (faster) way.\n\nI think you might be throwing this off somehow.\n\nIn general, mutating inside of a groupby is not a good idea. Further it is not efficient at all.\n\nYou are welcome to debug if you want/can but would have to have a simple example.\n\nTry using `.filter()` then doing a groupby. or use non-nested groupbys.\n"
