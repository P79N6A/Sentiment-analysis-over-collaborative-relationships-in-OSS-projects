Of course, it just comes down to overloading the amount of slicing options present to new users.\n\nAs has already been discussed on the mailing list, when labels are numerical, having a clear option for slicing by row and slicing by value, and raising errors for misuse is quite helpful.\n\nFor example, imagine I have spectral data running from 400.0 - 700.0nm.  If users are slicing by value, it's too easy for them to do [400:700] when they mean [400.0:700.0] or [400:700.0] and I'd prefer my programs bring this to their attention than assume their intentions.  \n"

This is because if I am ever looking to do any sort of advanced indexing, I immediately hammer out `.i<Tab>` to view all the methods. I didn't even notice how much I do this until I started to actively think about it and it's clear that I've hardwired myself based off of this existing nomenclature! \n\nOn that note, I think using `iloc` maintains consistency with other indexing methods and also, as a method name, indicates what operation is performed.\n"
