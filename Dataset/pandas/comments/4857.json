    "body": "@jmcnamara Thanks! Building on this, it would be great to look at memory and performance for xlsxwriter as well as the row-oriented vs. column-oriented discussion (like you mentioned).\n\nBtw - I'm planning to resolve #3122 by moving the formatting on to the `ExcelWriter` class, so that `openpyxl`/`xlwt` can convert themselves first to deal with the dtypes comparison, so I think it should be pretty easy to handle that change in that way.\n"
