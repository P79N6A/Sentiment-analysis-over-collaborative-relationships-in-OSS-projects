    "body": "Hmm...I'm not sure entirely where the problem lies - but it definitely seems to be related to the length of the DataFrame. I've tried creating a generic sequence of dates and running `np.abs` on them, and it doesn't give an error:\n\n```\nn = 100\nind = pd.date_range(start='2009-07-01', periods=n, freq='H')\ndf = DataFrame(data=np.random.randn(n), index=ind)\ndf['time'] = df.index\nimage_time = dateutil.parser.parse('2009-07-02 13:04')\nnp.abs(df.time -image_time)\n```\n\nAlso, the results look fairly sensible - differences are a maximum of 2 days. However, if I run the same code with `n = 101` instead, I still don't get an error, but I get insane looking results - see the example of the last few lines of the results below:\n\n**Results where n = 100**\n2009-07-05 01:00:00   2 days, 11:56:00\n2009-07-05 02:00:00   2 days, 12:56:00\n2009-07-05 03:00:00   2 days, 13:56:00\n\n**Results where n = 101**\n2009-07-05 02:00:00   2536 days, 23:59:51.242751\n2009-07-05 03:00:00   2580 days, 00:12:35.359744\n2009-07-05 04:00:00   2622 days, 00:33:40.130816\n\nSomething strange definitely seems to be going on there!\n\nGoing back to the example that I provided when opening this issue (shown in the gist at https://gist.github.com/robintw/631b53fa0cd9dbdabb36), the results seem to be sensible (a max difference of 3 days) when run with the `aeronet.txt` file, but when run with `aeronet_long.txt` it gives the error below, which all seems to stem from the printing code:\n\n```\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\n<ipython-input-35-97fdad570e66> in <module>()\n     22 # Trying to do the absolute difference gives an error for aeronet_long.txt but not for aeronet.txt\n     23 result = np.abs(aeronet.time - image_time)\n---> 24 print result\n     25 \n\nC:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\series.pyc in __str__(self)\n   1021         if py3compat.PY3:\n   1022             return self.__unicode__()\n-> 1023         return self.__bytes__()\n   1024 \n   1025     def __bytes__(self):\n\nC:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\series.pyc in __bytes__(self)\n   1031         \"\"\"\n   1032         encoding = com.get_option(\"display.encoding\")\n-> 1033         return self.__unicode__().encode(encoding, 'replace')\n   1034 \n   1035     def __unicode__(self):\n\nC:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\series.pyc in __unicode__(self)\n   1044                     else get_option(\"display.max_rows\"))\n   1045         if len(self.index) > (max_rows or 1000):\n-> 1046             result = self._tidy_repr(min(30, max_rows - 4))\n   1047         elif len(self.index) > 0:\n   1048             result = self._get_repr(print_header=True,\n\nC:\\Python27\\lib\\site-packages\\pandas\\core\\series.pyc in _tidy_repr(self, max_vals)\n   1069         \"\"\"\n   1070         num = max_vals // 2\n-> 1071         head = self[:num]._get_repr(print_header=True, length=False,\n   1072                                     name=False)\n   1073         tail = self[-(max_vals - num):]._get_repr(print_header=False,\n\nAttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute '_get_repr'\n```\n\nThat makes me suspect that the results given by the `aeronet_test.py` code running with `aeronet_long.txt` are also very strange results, and that is why an error is raised when we try to print them - because they're so insane that they can't be printed.\n\nDoes that help?\n"

    "body": "Thanks for all the investigation of this.\n\n@y-p: Using aeronet.time - pd.Timestamp(image_time) gives the same error for me.\n\nI hadn't noticed that after doing `np.abs` the result was in us not ns - is that basically a NumPy bug? If so, should I report that separately to NumPy?\n\nBasically, the results given by @jreback in the final line of his example seem right (apart from the fact that the datatype has been switched to us from ns). Once I've got the `np.abs` stuff working I was then going to find the minimum value and extract that row of the DataFrame, as that will be the row that has the closest time to the input time. So basically, if the result gives the right numbers (which the final result in the example above does), doesn't give an error, and works with something like `np.min` to get the minimum value, then that's all sorted for me.\n\nInterestingly, there also seems to be a problem with the final bit of my requirement: getting the minimum value. I suspect it is related to the other problems that you've identified:\n- Running a.argmin() gives an `OverflowError: long too big to convert`\n- Running a.min() gives a `TypeError: ufunc 'isnan' not supported for the input types, and the inputs could not be safely coerced to any supported types according to the casting rule 'safe'`\n\nOn a separate note: once we've sorted these problems, would it be worse adding a `closest_time` method to the DatetimeIndex object, in a similar manner to the `asof` method? Finding the closest row to a certain time is a fairly common operation with time-series data, so it may be worth including 'out-of-the-box'.\n"
