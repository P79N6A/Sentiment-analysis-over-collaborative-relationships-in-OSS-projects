    "body": "At it's core, it's just changing \"obj\" to optionally be a list/tuple then adding some extra formatting at the end, but to do that requires to change each method that takes in obj to support it, so it's more of a refactoring change than a wide spread functionality change.\r\n\r\nThat being said, even now I do think the assertion messages could still be better & have more options.  For instance, it would be nice if instead of printing out _all_ of `left` & `right` there was an option to print out only the places where they are different.  (if, for instance, `left` & `right` are 100+ elements printing out the entire lists is kinda unhelpful).\r\n\r\nAlso, it seems a bit redundant to both print out `df1.iloc[:, 1] and df2.iloc[:, 1] are different` and `df1.iloc[:, 1] and df2.iloc[:, 1] values are different (66.66667 %)` it the same message since from the second statement the first is implied.\r\n\r\nBut those are projects for another weekend."
