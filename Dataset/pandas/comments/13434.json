My thoughts are `read_html` are that the user should expect to have a bit of cleanup work to do. But if the change to handle this case doesn't break anything and isn't too complicated, I'd say it'd be a good addition.\n"

    "body": "@TomAugspurger the case I'm thinking of is where the first two rows are in the `<thead>` part of the `<table>`, and the other rows are in the `<tbody>` part. So yes they can clearly be distinguished from a row that is simply empty. Also, in the example I gave, every single `<tr>` element contains the same number of cells/columns (whether they are `<th>` or `<td>`), so there is no reason to generate a data frame with a different number of columns.\n"
