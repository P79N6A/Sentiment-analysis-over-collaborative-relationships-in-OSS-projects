    "body": "It might be related - I don't know the underlying code - but it's not the same.\n\n#4197 is about creating bins where partial data is available. Their example is downsample to 5 minute data and the last bin has only 3 minutes of data. The question is should that last bin have been created?  (There is an example where label='right' should be used but this matches the example above for daily resampling)\n\n#4076 is about extra bins when resampling e.g. you downsample to weekly from daily data, and in some circumstances you get an extra bin at the end which does not correspond to any of the data.\n\nIn this issue, the labelling does not correspond to the data included in the weekly bin: the first bin is labelled 2001-01-05 (i.e. midnight between 2001-01-04 and 2001-01-05) but contains data from after this point. So we have forward information in our resampled data.\n"
