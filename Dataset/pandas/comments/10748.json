See here: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/factor.html\n\n> The codes of a factor may contain NA. For a numeric x, set exclude = NULL to make NA an extra level (prints as `<NA>`); by default, this is the last level.\n> \n> If NA is a level, the way to set a code to be missing (as opposed to the code of the missing level) is to use is.na on the left-hand-side of an assignment (as in is.na(f)[i] <- TRUE; indexing inside is.na does not work). Under those circumstances missing values are currently printed as `<NA>`, i.e., identical to entries of level NA.\n"
