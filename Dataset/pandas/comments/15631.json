    "body": "this is as expected (see https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/6149), but see below.\r\n\r\n``df.loc[:, columns]`` is treated as ``df[columns]`` which *may* return a view.\r\n\r\n``df.loc[indexer, columns]`` also *may* return return a view, but almost always does not in practice.\r\n\r\nyes if ``indexer is df.index`` we could treat this as the former situation (IOW the indexer is exactly equals to the index of the frame). (its just a ``indexer.equals(df.index)`` type of comparison.\r\n\r\nSo i'll mark this as a compat issue if you'd do a pull-request would be great. This is actually a very small change, see https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/core/indexing.py#L503"
