The all `None` case isn't hard to handle, but most of the work for me is identifying the column(s) that are the problem in datasets with hundreds of columns.\r\n\r\nSince it's throwing on a particular column, it may be that the first encountered column is the only one that can be named, but that's still helpful. An alternative would be providing a brief code example that will identify these all `None` columns (and perhaps an example of fixing it with `convert_strl`).\r\n\r\nI could imagine relatively novice pandas users (i.e. Stata switchers) hitting this error, so I'd lean toward a little more hand-holding/direction. Happy to hear counterarguments, though."
