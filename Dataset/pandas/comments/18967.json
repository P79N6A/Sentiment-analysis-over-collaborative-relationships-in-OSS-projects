Is that correct @cgohlke?\r\n\r\n> On the README it says \"NumPy: 1.7.0 or higher\" so this should work, right?\r\n\r\nI think it's 1.8 now (need to update the README.md), but that's if you're building from source."

    "body": "@cgohlke Since many packages depending on numpy's C API/ABI don't actually need the latest version, why not use an older one to make things more compatible? I fully understand if this is out of scope, as you make your wheels available for testing and evaluation purposes only (should they be on PyPI then?). If that's the case, then maybe @matthew-brett can help out by extending https://github.com/MacPython/pandas-wheels to build the Windows wheels there as well via Appveyor, so that a more official and transparent way of building Windows wheels exists."
