    "body": "Right, to summarize a bit, quite often with float64 indexes, you have two indexes which logically have similar keys, but because they were computed slightly differently, or came from different sources, they aren't binary identical.\r\n\r\nI first tried implementing this just within Float64Index, but quickly ran into issues where I needed support implemented within the base class. Of course, once that happened, well, you need to implement a lot of this up into the other classes as well.\r\n\r\nThe basic premise of the design is that explicit will still always override implicit (which would be the tolerance attribute), which is why tolerance was added as an argument to many of the set operations. Also, any resulting indexes from these operations will have the tolerance that was used be set for its own tolerance attribute."
