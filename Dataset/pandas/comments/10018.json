    "body": "the `csv` library defaults do quote the carriage returns with `quoting=0` (or `csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL`\r\n\r\nThe issue (as pointed above) is because the `to_csv` method sets the `line_terminator` to `\\n` by default [[1]](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/core/generic.py#L9513). Instead can it not be set as `None` in both the `to_csv` method and the underlying `CSVFormatter` object [[2]](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/io/formats/csvs.py#L38) as defaults and let the `csv` module set the `line_terminator` value?\r\n\r\nA final change would be to not initialize the writer with `line_terminator=None`. A possible filter when creating the `writer_kwargs` dict? [[3]](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/pandas/io/formats/csvs.py#L164)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how this would work in Unix environments where the default line terminator is `\\n` (as I don't have access to one to test)"
