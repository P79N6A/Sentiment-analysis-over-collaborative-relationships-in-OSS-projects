Is there a way to prevent creation of hash tables on column index?\r\n\r\nWas this regression due to something that improved performance of row-based index but possibly hurt columnar access?\r\n"

    "body": "@dragoljub short answer is this.\r\n\r\nWhen the ``over_size_threshold`` was triggered (> 1M len of index), a different path was followed where the hashtable was constructed for *any* type of indexing operation (once its constructed it stays till collected). The issue was that for these large indexes we actually use searchsorted rather than the hashtable to look things up. So we were needlessly constructing and using memory for this.\r\n\r\nThe solution was to do our uniqueness checking at the same time as we are already checking for sortedness( e.g. the ``is_monotonic_increasing``).\r\n\r\nHowever it seems that this was *each* time constructing the index mapping (bad).\r\n\r\ncc @llllllllll \r\ncc @ssanderson "

    "body": "@jreback I took a look at your proposed fix.  I *think* it looks correct, but I think there might be a simpler fix that just makes `initialized` synonymous with `self.mapping is not None` (or drops `initialized entirely in favor of the `is not None` check), and changes the gating behavior on the `is_unique` property.  It's certainly possible that I missed something though: keeping all the different flags straight in my head is tricky."
