    "body": "happy to have a pull request to do this\nthe issue is that list-like can be satisfied by a single pandas object (eg series/DataFrame) and then doesn't give a sensible error message \n\nso I guess the true meaning here is an iterable that may or may not be indexable (eg dict) that is not a pandas object might work (and maybe need to add generator too as it's not technically in that definition)\n\ndoc string improvement also useful\n\npls add your example as a test but can't change any existing tests\n"
