    "body": "IIRC the thought process in the current implementation revolved around the stdlib version being nonsensical; \"unix timestamp if if were local\" isn't a concept I've seen elsewhere.  The decision was that `pd.Timestamp.now().timestamp` should match `time.time()`.\r\n\r\nThat said, differing from the stdlib is certainly not ideal.  Personally I prefer the More Correct implementation we have, but understand if others prefer the More Compatible implementation.\r\n"
