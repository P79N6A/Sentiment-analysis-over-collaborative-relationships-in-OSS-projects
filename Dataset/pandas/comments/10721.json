    "body": "Thanks for the clarification (and the super-quick response!), and apologies for the noise. I just saw that this is indeed mentioned in the docs (for reference: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/basics.html#copying). It's good to know that `Series.sort()` will be deprecated soon. I think it is the fact that this method does an in-place modification (but most/all others don't) which has led to quite a bit of confusion amongst some colleagues of mine. Glad to hear that it will be consistent soon.\n"
