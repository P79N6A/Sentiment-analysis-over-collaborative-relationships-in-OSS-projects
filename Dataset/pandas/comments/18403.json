    "body": "> though as this didn't appear to actually change anything in setup.py I am not sure this changes anything\r\n\r\nCorrect.  As mentioned, this PR is just the search+replace, does not implement the mentioned upsides.\r\n\r\n> i would rather leave the numpy things isolated in a single place.\r\n\r\nThat's a reasonable preference.  The two big motivations I have in mind are:\r\n\r\n- In trying to get `cythonize` working, the src directory is a PITA.  Having fewer things depend on it will make life better.\r\n\r\n- I'm pretty sure that 'source'/'include'/'pxdfiles' keys affect build time.  I'll try to do some profiling and check this.  If that turns out to be wrong, I'll drop this.\r\n\r\n> you can certainly typedef things to use the same structure\r\n\r\nI poked at this but without much luck.  Is there a way to do this such that I could import npy_datetimestruct in a cython file and use it interchangeably with pandas_datetimestruct?  Or heck, import it `as pandas_datetimestruct`?  That would be just as effective as the changes in this PR, but with a much smaller footprint."
