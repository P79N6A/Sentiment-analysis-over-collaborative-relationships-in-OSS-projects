    "body": "this is a 'bug' that surfaced because of the join of the non-unique indexes even though they are equal is being done.....should be straightforward to fix (and that's why the memory is blowing up is a n^2 memory operation i think)\n\nyou can also do this in a frame, and would be better IMHO (e.g. guarantee to have a unique index if they values are the columns).\n\nnon-unique is very tricky and problematic...so avoid if possible\n"

    "body": "Thanks for having a look.\n\nI'm not sure how I could reformulate it as a DataFrame. I want to multiply each day (1440 minutes/values) in `fracofday` by the corresponding daily value in temp such that each temp value is repeated 1440 times.\n\nSince I don't actually care about the indexes after the temp array has been aligned with `fracofday` (by reindexing) I can work around it by dropping down to numpy.\n"
