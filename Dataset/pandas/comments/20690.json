    "body": "@gfyoung are you just referring to the ability to return multiple tables? `read_html` technically already does that as it returns a list instead of just a DataFrame, but chime in if I misunderstand.\r\n\r\n@jstray one design consideration to think about - should multiple `tbody` elements return a MultiIndexed DataFrame? I suppose having those multiple `tbody` tags in the first place is indicative of different groupings within the table, so maybe it makes sense for each of them to be a unique value within the first level of a MultiIndex?\r\n\r\nNot saying that needs to happen at the outset as certainly being able to just parse them would be an improvement over what we have today. Just throwing that out there as food for thought as you try a patch"
