    "body": "Hi, thanks for picking this up!\n\nYeah, I understand it’s not ideal to have NaN in the index. However I wrote a class (actually a number of classes) to do my data evaluation, which need a DataFrame of a defined structure in it’s .data property. Datapoints always have an index and mostly a timestamp as well. The index is unique, the timestamp not always, but mostly. Therefore, I figured it would be generally good to have them both in a MultiIndex (because if there is timestamp information, I usually use this to select data).\nIn some evaluations I prefer for simplicity to have only one oft he two in the index, therefore the drop_index, which is used internally in a method of one of my classes.\nI hope this makes some sense without all the context...\n"
