    "body": "this is a numpy issue, see [here](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/numpy/lib/nanfunctions.py#L340). I don't know when/how this changed, but it looks like a different impl that `nanmean`. I don't really know the reason this would be done. pls bring it up there. I guess will leave this open, but there is nothing pandas can do about this. \n\nWell there is if they properly handle `__array_wrap__` and returned something to know that we have a reduced function, but I don't think we need to go down that road.\n"
