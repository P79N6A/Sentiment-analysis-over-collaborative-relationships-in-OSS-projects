    "body": "I agree, that's how I solve it now, but this adds a function to the global namespace, which is not always desired. If the computation that you require is a big one, than sure, that should be a proper function. \n\nFor small inline calculations like the one I used as an example, a lambda would be much nicer. Also if you need to pass additional arguments to your function, a lambda is just a much more elegant way of coding it that with a new global function.\n\nIn the pandas docs, one of the examples on how to use 'agg' actually uses lambda's this way.\n\n``` python\ngrouped.agg({'C' : np.sum,\n             'D' : lambda x: np.std(x, ddof=1)})\n```\n\n(http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/groupby.html#applying-different-functions-to-dataframe-columns)\n\nI don't think that the feature actually \"adds complexity\". It gives you an additional, elegant way of doing something without even changing the existing API functionality.\n"
