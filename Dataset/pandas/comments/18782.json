My general recommendation (and I think at least soft community consensus) is to only use `[]` indexing for DataFrame column selection and `iloc` / `loc` everywhere else.\r\n\r\n@jorisvandenbossche's summary does a good job, although doesn't have this particular corner (duplicate vs non-duplicate)\r\n"
