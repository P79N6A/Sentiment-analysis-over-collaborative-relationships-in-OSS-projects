I did the work across two computers. My latest update was from the other computer so I was reseting to what I had pushed. But I think I reset my local master branch to my remote PR branch. I didn't realize that until made those last couple changes, pushed everything, and tried to change to master (which I was already on). I have no idea if that's related to the github issue though.  I'll make a new PR for now.\n"
