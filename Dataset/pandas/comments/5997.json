I'm not sure what you mean by \"coded a regression of 1.8 into the tests\".\nas our CI setup tests against 1.6.1, 1.7.1 and pypi 1.8.0 and so whatever changed broke\nwith all those numpy versions. That's the opposite meaning of regression as I know it.\n\nI started looking at the damage here and found at least this change in numpy behaviour,\nwhich off-hand seems like a bug:\n\n```\n# np 1.7.2\nIn [1]: a=np.array([1,2,3])\n   ...: a[1.1]\nOut[1]: 2\n```\n\n```\n#1.8 tip 49cff2b\nIn [5]: a=np.array([1,2,3])\n   ...: a[1.1]\nOut[5]: array(2)\n```\n"

I'm sure numpy has a fancy CI setup of their own,\nif you can put up a regularly updated git-master whl at a public http location, we can probably\nmove one of our builds to use that and give us both better confidence when making changes.\n\nYou'll then be able to check pandas integration easily through our new [CI status page](http://scatterci.github.io/ScatterCI-Pandas).\n"
