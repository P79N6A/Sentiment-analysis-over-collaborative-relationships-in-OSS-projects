    "body": "I was looking into this and while implementing wondered if it was strictly necessary? If you're using an SQLAlchemy engine then you can use the `engine.table_names` function to get this information. As far as I can tell the only DBAPI compatible interface supported by pandas is sqlite in which case you'd need to run the above query. \n\nIs the intention to wrap the `engine.table_names` function in SQLDatabase, create an equivalent function in SQLIteDatabase which will call the query supplied by @DSLituiev and wrap both of these behind a new interface in the `pandas.io.sql` module?\n\nEdit: For reference: https://github.com/sornars/pandas/commit/3411d7bcf392fe0846444b5cf073ea383e027582\n\nIf this is what's intended then I'll write up some tests and open up a PR.\n"
