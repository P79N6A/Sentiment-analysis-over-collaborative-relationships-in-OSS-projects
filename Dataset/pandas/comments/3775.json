    "body": "here's a short explanation of both:\n\n`git merge <a-branch-name>` will take the union of the commits of the current branch and the one in `<a-branch-name>`. it's nice for when u create a branch (they are cheap as u probably know) off of another branch for example and then u want to go back to ur original and bring the changes from the branch u just made. it does leave ugly messages about merging and so forth so...\n\n`git rebase` allows you to change the history (squash is a possible action you can take when u do `git rebase -i`) which is not necessarily a good thing if you've pushed to a remote and a bunch of people depend on ur changes. for PRs it's usually ok since they get merged when you are finished. i use it all the time for PRs because i make a bunch of tiny commits for anything significant and i _really_ don't want to lose stuff and then i usually want to get rid of commits that say dumb things like \"arg\" or \"clean up\" or any changeset that isn't really interesting\n\nanother thing you probably want to do on occasion and right before you declare that your PR is ready to be merged is to say `git fetch upstream && git rebase upstream/master` since that will help people doing the merging by make _you_ deal with merge conflicts :) not that we're lazy but since it's your changeset you'll be able to deal the conflicts most efficiently. `git remote add upstream git://github.com/pydata/pandas.git` will add `upstream` to your list of remotes. other people may have different workflows, but this is what works for me. i can attest to the fact that the people here have been very patient and helpful with my (lack of) knowledge about git especially @y-p so i just wanted to pay it forward so to speak.\n\n(there's tons more to learn and there are about a billion options for every `git` command) just want to give u a sort of \"everyday\" picture of how i use them, other may use them diffferently\n"

It covers the merge vs. rebase debate fairly, and I feel is the most common workflow used within this community of developers. Is there anyway we could clean this up just a tad and use in the developers page, under the section, [_Working with the code_](http://pandas.pydata.org/developers.html#working-with-the-code)? If so, it could help new contributors overcome the intimidation of initial git exposure and be more proficient with their contributions!\n\nAnyways, just my thoughts. Thanks!\n"
