    "body": "@jreback : Python 2.7.10, Pandas 0.14.1 (before update), Pandas 0.16.2 after update.The main problem is, that compatibility breaks if GZIP compression is used. The example with just `open('/tmp/test.pklz', 'wb')` works without any problems, I can then unpickle it with `pd.read_pickle()` after update.\n\n@shoyer You are totally right, it was just a quick hack. Unzipping manually and reading the file afterwards does work and is apparently the only solution. \n\nOverall not a huge problem (and another reminder one should not use pickle as data storage) - but due to this combination, you need quite a bit of code and error handling to work around this when updating. The optimal solution would be if `pd.read_pickle` would just work on GzipFile objects too (but I see that this is probably not widely used and therefore unnecessary..).\n"
