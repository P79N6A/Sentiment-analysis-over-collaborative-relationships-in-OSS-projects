Any help would be appreciated.  \n\nOne thing I'm worried about is that I didn't overload every attributes that DataFrame relies on.  I did most of the basic ones, and all those of the public API, but there may be more that I missed because they were inherited from NDFrame or PandasObject.\n\nAlso, I decided to to call my deserialization functions mload and mloads to avoid name conflicts with the pandas API.\n"
