    "body": "I don't think the Numpy Docstring Standard explicitly requires periods. I took a quick look and other \"core\" classes (like `Index` and `MultiIndex`) are also missing periods at the end of their respective docstrings so if one wants to make this aesthetic change it would probably be best to write a script with the appropriate regular expression to put the periods where they aren't."
