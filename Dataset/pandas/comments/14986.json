Having both seems like a road to confusion for users."

    "body": "There are no plans to deprecate `describe`. And I also do not see the potential confusion. The addition of `agg` should be looked at like this (apart from other reasons to have `agg`):\r\n\r\n- `describe` gives you a default set of statistics\r\n- if you want a custom set of statistics, the `agg` method let's you rather easily create a function to do this\r\n\r\nBut of course, there can still be discussion about what the default set of statistics should be, and whether this should include a sum or not. But, what I just want to say is that, for me, this discussion is separate from the introduction of `agg`. \r\n\r\nThere are some reasons listed in #14483 to not include sum in `describe`. If you have additional arguments to include it (eg the other programs you mention, although R is an example that does not include sum in its summary), please add it to that issues (to keep the discussion in a central place)"
