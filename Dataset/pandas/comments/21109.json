I've added all the words to the wordlist (this file is now huge) and corrected some stuff, I will need your help in regards to some changes that I have done:\r\n\r\n- changed `indicies` to `indices` since indices is already in the plural form (I only changed comments and docstrings, there are some variables using this indicies but I didn't want to touch them unless you agree)\r\n- changed `performant` to `efficient` this term was used plenty of times and I'm not sure if changing it is desirable (if not I'll revert the changes)\r\n\r\nThe spelling extension is funny as it divides words by special characters (anything like `-` or `'`) so I had to add some words that don't exist in the dictionary but make sense when attached to others. (hope this makes sense?)\r\n\r\nI've also given it some thought and I think we could fail the build by raising an exception if there are any words in this output.txt file, the idea is to:\r\n- open the file\r\n- readlines\r\n- pass if empty\r\nNot sure if this is a smart way to approach the problem though. \r\n\r\nFinally, the time it takes to spellcheck. If every single file needs to be generated then it will take about 2-3minutes to generate and read the files and about 1 minute to spellcheck and output misspelt words.\r\n\r\nIf the files are already generated then it runs in 1 minute. This is with the `spelling_show_suggestions` option set to False because this option seems to increase the time it takes to spellcheck to about 3x worse.\r\n"

    "body": "I see. But the names need to be added to a wordlist like the file named `spelling_wordlist.txt`. Since the extension captures all text within the project every term will have to be whitelisted (unless its a grammatical error) which means that the name of every contributor needs to be included in a file somewhere. \r\n\r\nIt makes sense that perhaps the contributor names should be in a separate file like WillAyd suggested. Also, the extension needs very specific ways to whitelist terms - one term per line. As I pointed out, the problem with scrappy contributors name is that the names will need to be split into both newlines + spaces so every name is a whitelisted word.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that the extension divides words by special characters, it could potentially cause trouble with names such as the one from  Yan Facai (example: 颜发才（Yan Facai） ) so the name needs to be added with both the special characters and normal characters - you can see this on the wordlist.\r\n\r\nSo I'm unsure what to do now in regards to jreback suggestions. If anyone else could give a hand in order for me to solve this issue and the PR merged I'll be happy to fix/modify anything 😃 👍 "
