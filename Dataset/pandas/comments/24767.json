    "body": "The above was in my development environment (where I apparently still has an old pyarrow), but I now created a clean new env just with installing pyarrow and pandas, and can confirm the issue. With pyarrow 0.11 it works fine, but reading the file with pyarrow 0.8.0 gives a segfault. \r\n\r\nOf course, it can also be a bug in the old version of pyarrow. But the question is then if we need to guard users against it (if there is some way to detect the invalid data coming from pyarrow)."
