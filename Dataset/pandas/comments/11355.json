It seems like neither `dataframe_to_rows()` nor `constant_memory` supports merged ranges across rows, but this is something I'd like to support if at all possible.\r\n\r\nIs there a generally accepted strategy for supporting merged ranges *and* keeping memory consumption low? For our application, we're okay if the processing takes longer — it just so happens that the machines we're using are constrained by memory, and we aren't able to use swap."
