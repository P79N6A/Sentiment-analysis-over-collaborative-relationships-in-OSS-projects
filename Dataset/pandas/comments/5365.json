    "body": "I believe we've now resolved this on current master thanks to @jcbozonier and #5271.  We're almost at a release candidate for 0.13 (just one small feature request to wrap up), so if you want to work off of pandas' master, it should be completely or entirely stable.\n\nThe other option is to manually edit pandas/io/ga.py in site-packages and add in the changes from #5271.\n\nThanks for the bug report - we always appreciate them!  Please close this issue if your problem is resolved.\n"
