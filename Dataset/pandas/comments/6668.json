Do any of of the other characters meaning change context? I know for the tilde I was going through and replacing the `\\\\textilde` with `\\sim` recently.

But I think to be most accurate one would just need to disable escaping for characters nested between two `$`-characters.\n\nCurrently `^$^$` \nwill be \n`\\textasciicircum\\$\\textasciicircum\\$`\nwhile it should be\n`\\textasciicircum$^$`\n\nSo by _removing_ characters from the escape-set you will not get the expected result. Apart from this, specifying a removal-set does not seem future-proof, as the set may suddenly change and you would constantly need to add additional characters to the removal-set when updating to a newer version.\n\nIMHO if somebody wants to have control over the output he should be able to just disable the escaping and take care of it himself, this way one gets maximum control.\n\nOr is there something I missed?\n"

    "body": "That's what I was telling myself as well all the time and the reason for the deadline approaching quite fast meanwhile ;)\n\nI guess it's quite hard to get a regex right which is actually able to distinguish between the use of a `\\` in a latex-command and in another context. And both may appear in the same content which is being converted in one single `to_latex` call.\nTherefore I would say it is best to be able to completely turn off escaping. This requires \"fiddling\" but at least one is able to have full control over the output.\nOn the other hand it leaves room for improvements on the (still default) escape-mode turned on, which could implement a \"only escape characters like: ^° etc. when they are not nested within two $\"-blackbox-intelligence which will probably be what people want in 95% of the cases.\n"

    "body": "AFAIK, the regex in python isn't really stateful (which it is elsewhere IIUC), so it's pretty hard to make a regex that distinguishes characters only when they're nested in `$...$`. Not escaping everything is definitely one way to go, and is probably worth it for this special case as a stop-gap. But it definitely shouldn't be the default. It's very rare that I actual write latex math mark-up in a pandas object.\n\nThere's probably a pretty simple solution that doesn't involve regex that just walks the text and keeps track if its in a math environment or not. It won't be very fast, but if you're writing a table big enough for this to be an issue you're probably \"doing it wrong.\"\n\nWhat do projects like [asciitable](http://cxc.harvard.edu/contrib/asciitable/) do? I don't think SimpleTable in statsmodels handles this either.\n"
