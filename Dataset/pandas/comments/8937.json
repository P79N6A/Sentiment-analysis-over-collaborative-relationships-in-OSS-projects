    "body": "ok, added it under api change (without an example)\n\nI don't think any more methods should be added to `Series.cat`: simple calling `s.unique()` (or `s.min()` or `s.describe()`) is enough. After the last discussion about what is API and what is not, I started to think of all methods in `Categorical` as \"for compatibility with numpy\" and I think that's the right way to think about them. If a users knows better they can look at the docstrings, but I don't think pandas should do any API guarantee whether these methods stay or change or be removed. \n"
