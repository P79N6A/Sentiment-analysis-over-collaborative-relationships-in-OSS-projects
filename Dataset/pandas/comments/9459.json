    "body": "@jreback, @Kodiologist: I think these two methods should neither be added to `Series.cat` nor to api.rst: the categorical section in api.rst is on purpose only the methods under `Series.cat` and these methods only make sense on a categorical but not on any other dtype. In this case it is simple that the implementation of a method in `Series` is different for `Categorical` than `ndarray` and the code is put into `Categorical` instead of making the method longer. During the initial iterations, many methods from Categorical, which I had added to api.rst, were removed in the end for that reason: min,max,... \n\nI think public is fine, as long as the API documentation makes it clear that directly using methods on `Categorical` or via `s.values` is prone to break over the time (currently API: everything under `s.cat` and the `Categorical` constructor). If these should become private, it makes sense to also mark all other methods (min, max,...) private and I don't think that's possible (some are used as a drop-in for public `ndarray` methods, so the caller would need to test for `_min` and `min`...)\n"

Then we don't have that potential problem.\n\nSo to say I still vote for making them private functions. No user should ever use this I think? As we want them to use the categorical series, and not the raw Categorical. So a user should use `Series.dropna()`, and not `Categorical.dropna()` (there is also not a `ndarray.dropna()`). Providing it (even when documenting not to use it), will just tempt user to use it. \nAnd in an ideal world, it is still the goal that one day an array with a native `Categorical` type will be available (if not a numpy array, then maybe a dynd array), and in that case we want to replace `Categorical` with that I think (or at least the user facing `.values` categorical). So, until then, I would keep the public API of `Categorical` as much as close to a plain ndarray, and let the special functions it has be exposed for users through `.cat`\n"

We could enforce that rule, but I think that as things stand, the user needs to do some pretty silly things to get a Categorical like that, like renaming an existing level to `np.nan` while there are already NAs (-1 codes) in the Categorical, so enforcement may not be necessary.\n"
