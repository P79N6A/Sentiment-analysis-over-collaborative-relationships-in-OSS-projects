    "body": "private methods should be explicity tested just as public api methods.\n\nThese tests are for 2 different things. The first because of an invalid level name `KeyError` makes senses. The 2nd for an invalid reshape operation (see below).\n\nThe issue here is this. a `MultiIndex` technically can have duplicate names, but in point of fact they are pretty much useless and tend to break / degrade other ops. E.g. stack/unstack, and make your columns duplicate when reset. So I think we should actually raise on construction to solve this entire problem.\n\nSo names can be:\n- None (where they get defaulted level numbers)\n- unique integers / names\n- None / mixed integers/names (usually arise from non-named reduction ops).\n"
