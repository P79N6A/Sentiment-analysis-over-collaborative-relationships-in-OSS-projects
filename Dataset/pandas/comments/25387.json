    "body": "Thanks for the issue! So I would say there are one of two routes here:\r\n\r\n  1. If you have actual updates you'd like to make to the documentation then a PR to update would always be welcome!\r\n  2. If you are unclear on the usage of the feature your best bet is to ask on StackOverflow\r\n\r\nI *think* this falls into the second categorization so going to close as this board is mostly reserved for actual bug and enhancement requests; SO's Q&A format is much better for usage questions and helps others with the same question in the future"
