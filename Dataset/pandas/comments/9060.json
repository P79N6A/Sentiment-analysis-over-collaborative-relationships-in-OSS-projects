    "body": "Thank you for doing some digging and getting back to me.\n\nThe instructions on the pandas website for installation (Linux: Debian/Ubuntu) was used `sudo apt-get install python3-pandas` so the Ubuntu distribution's repositories in 14.04.1 are still with 0.13.x branch of pandas.  The repositories took care of dependencies but _did not_ install openpyxl and would you know, the python2 version of openpxyl (`python-openpyxl`) is in the repositories but the python3 version (`python3-openpyxl`) is not in the repositories so I gave up on the Ubuntu 14.04.1 repositories and fell back to using pip (`pip3`) to install which got me the latest version of openpyxl causing my issue.  Installing python3-pandas by hand with all required and optional dependencies is going to take quite a while so I'm going to look at using `pip3` to fix the openpyxl package installation.\n\nNote that the pandas documentation still mentions \"openpyxl version 1.6.1 or higher\" for the 13.1 branch installation requirements for openpyxl (the page named install.html).\n\nBut the 14.1 version of the install.html page puts an upper bounds cap on the requirement \"openpyxl version 1.6.1 or higher, but lower than 2.0.0\".\n\nIt would help us repository installers who have to install openpyxl by hand with pip to have an upper version cap added to the pandas website 13.1 documentation (install.html) so we can feed pip the parameter to install a version of openpyxl less than or equal to the upper bound for 13.1 branch's ability to support the API of openpyxl.\n\nI can manually do this right now for my situation, I may play with the 14.1 upper bounds limit to see if it still works in 13.1 branch of pandas.\n\n---\n\n`$ sudo pip3 uninstall openpyxl`\n`$ sudo pip3 install \"openpyxl>=1.6.1,<2.0.0\"`\nDownloading/unpacking openpyxl>=1.6.1,<2.0.0\n  Downloading openpyxl-1.8.6-py2.py3-none-any.whl (190kB): 190kB downloaded\nInstalling collected packages: openpyxl\nSuccessfully installed openpyxl\nCleaning up...\n\n`$ipython3`\nPython 3.4.0 (default, Apr 11 2014, 13:05:11) \nType \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n\nIPython 1.2.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.\n?         -> Introduction and overview of IPython's features.\n%quickref -> Quick reference.\nhelp      -> Python's own help system.\nobject?   -> Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details.\n\n`In [1]: import openpyxl`\n\n`In [2]: openpyxl.__version__`\n`Out[2]: '1.8.6'`\n\n---\n\nRerun my ipython3 notebook\n\n--->`diff_output[(diff_output.has_change == 'Y')].to_excel('my-diff.xlsx')`\n\nExecutes without returning an error inside the ipython3 notebook!\nOutput excel file looks good!\n\nCheers!\n"
