So, as long as I can run my code with it disabled but not with it enabled, I'll disable it (as suggested by Jeff / @jreback #3434) until the crashing issue referenced is fixed or I understand how to avoid it.\n"

    "body": "@davidljung another recommendation, though maybe  not be possible for you. If you are looking at a fairly large dataset (300 million rows), then it behooves you NOT to use windows, rather pick up linux. The reason is scalability. Windows doesn't not play well with multi-processors which numexpr/pytables make heavy use. Yes it probably does work, but linux is just built much better and IMHO works MUCH better for even much smaller datasets. Less crashing, less issues, better support, etc. my2c.\n\nFWIW I DO use windows but only as a front end; all of my analysis is on local boxes (though I know people who run quite comfortable on remote , e.g. AWS type of hardware).\n"
