    "body": "@sylvaticus virtually everything you showed is well-documented and expected, IOW, \n- `.iloc` does not include the right bound as its a positional indexer\n- `.loc` DOES include the right bound as its a label based indexer\n- `.ix` remains (and is not deprecated) mainly because it offers some slightly syntactic convenience on multi-axis indexing (IOW you can do combined label and positional indexing on different axes)\n- `[]` tries to be smart so lots of issues as indicated in #9595 \n\nThere is an issue somewhere where we discuss the handling of missing indexers when using a list-like (and whether you should raise or reindex-like when). At some point I think we need an option for this, e.g.\n\n`.loc(errors='raise' or 'ignore')[....]`, to handle both of these cases, which are both valid and used.\n\nas far as performance. Well correctness matters first. You should not be using these indexers repeatedly in a loop. If you are then its a user error.\n"
