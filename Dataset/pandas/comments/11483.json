I guess I would expect if having the by-keyword, we would get the same results.\n\nAlso, can you take a look at my pull request: https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/11441\n\nI am trying to get a better implementation of the weighs keyword, and also work even though you have different nan's in the data & weights. But if this could be integrated in your solution I would be sooo happy\n\nFor example\n\n``` python\ndf.plot.hist(column='two', by='one', weights='three')\n# or\ndf.groupby('one').plot.hist(column='two', weighs='three')\n```\n\nand when plotting multiple data, perhaps like below\n\n``` python\ndf.plot.hist(column=['data1', 'data2'], by='one', weights=['weights1', 'weighs2'])\n```\n"
