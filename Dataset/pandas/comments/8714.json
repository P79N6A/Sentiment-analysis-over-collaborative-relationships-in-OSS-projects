    "body": "There are two things that bother me.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is that concatenation code somehow crept back into Block class. Concatenating Categoricals (with ndarrays or with other categoricals) seems a valid scenario regardless of Blocks. It creates those really weird workflows when you need to create Blocks just to concatenate two values (I'm looking at you `DatetimeIndex.hour`). It seems simpler to just add proper special-case code to `core.common._concat_compat`. Or to put special-case concatenation close to their class definitions and do something like:\n\n``` python\ndef concatenate_arrays(arrays):\n    for fn in [pd.core.categorical.maybe_concatenate_categoricals,\n               pd.core.sparse.array.maybe_concatenate_sparsearrays]:\n        retval = fn(arrays)\n        if retval is not None:\n            return retval\n    else:\n        return np.concatenate([maybe_getvalues(a) for a in arrays])\n```\n\nThis particular PR might probably get away with just fixing _concat_compat and leaving the rest of the code intact (if Series constructor supports Categorical data). And speaking of `_concat_compat`, it's quite possible that the special-casing of datetimes/timedeltas there is no longer necessary since numpy is now 1.7+.\n\nThe other thing is that Series being doubly special strikes back again: not only its first axis doesn't allow type variation (special case #1), but there is also an _implicit_ axis=1 which allows Series to be stacked _horizontally_ (special case #2). I wonder how much will it take to stop pretending and make Series **internally** a dataframe and if it will reduce the amount of special-casing. I also wonder if there's a place under the sun for type-varying (aka non-singleblock) Series, one use case that immediately comes to mind is that `frame.iterrows` can finally stop losing type information. \n"
