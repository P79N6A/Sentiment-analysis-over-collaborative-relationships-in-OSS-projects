    "body": "> @shoyer that doesn't make any sense. Timestamp is a sub-class of datetime. It doesn't take the correct (positional, nor keyword args ATM). I don't see the problem here. Yes it also does a lot more, but that's exactly the point, it IS user friendly w/o be ambiguous.\n\nYou cannot add alternate signatures without adding ambiguity. For example, suppose a naive user tries to pass three string arguments instead of integers into the new constructor. This is invalid for both datetime and the existing Timestamp signature, but because these arguments are supplied as strings, it would still trigger the existing codepath.\n\nLet's compare what they would see:\n\n```\n>>> pd.Timestamp('2000', '01', '01')\nUnknownTimeZoneError: '01'\n\n>>> datetime.datetime('2000', '01', '01')\nTypeError: an integer is required\n```\n\nThe error from datetime is _much_ more informative.\n\nThe standard library `datetime.datetime` class does not accept a string to convert to avoid exactly these sorts of issues. Instead, you are forced to use alternate constructors such as `strptime`.\n\nIt is unambiguously poor API design to make functions that do two very different things depending on the exact form of the input.\n\nI'm all for making `pd.Timestamp` more consistent with `datetime.datetime` if you're willing to deal with the hassle of a long deprecation cycle, but the right approach is not to overload the constructor to do something totally different. The right approach would be to switch the constructor entirely.\n"

The whole notion of a user having to choose alternate constructors (and I know we had this discussion w.r.t. RangeIndex) is completely bonkers to me.\n\nJust to prove I'm not crazy, here are some high lights from the first page of a Google search for \"Python multiple constructors\":\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/2164258/multiple-constructors-in-python\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/682504/what-is-a-clean-pythonic-way-to-have-multiple-constructors-in-python\nhttp://www.erol.si/2016/01/python-and-multiple-constructors/\nhttps://pythonconquerstheuniverse.wordpress.com/2010/03/17/multiple-constructors-in-a-python-class/ (read the comments)\n\nI could go on, but you get the point.\n\nYou'll notice that the universal advice seems to be to skip the magic and use classmethods for alternate constructors instead of overloading `__init__`.\n"
