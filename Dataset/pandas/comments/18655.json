Unfortuantely, I'm not sure I really understand your question, since scraped or not, we will read so long as the CSV is valid.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I tried reading your SO post, but the code is very hard to follow since you have it somewhat all over the place.  If you could try to post a clean version of your code and attach the CSV's in this post (just upload via GitHub as .txt files), that would be great."
