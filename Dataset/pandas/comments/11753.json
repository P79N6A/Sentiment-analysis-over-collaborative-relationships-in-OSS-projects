    "body": "I think there is a misunderstanding here.  `axis='index'` and `axis=0` are the same thing, just synonyms for the dimension to do the operation on.  And actually for series having the `axis` argument does not make any sense since it is a 1-dimensional object.  If you want to do it on the index itself, you need to make that a column in a DataFrame.\n"
