    "body": "Further investigation using a hex editor has revealed what is going on:\n- I added 0x1A (\"EOF\") to a different file and it did not cause any problems.  Pandas read_csv imported it without error.\n- I parsed every line of the problematic CSV individually, until I isolated the one causing the problem.  It was over 3000 rows after the stated row number in the error message.\n- the row in question had a column with a double quote mark following the delimiter - there were not supposed to be any quote marks in the file.  There was no second double quote in the column, or on the row\n- I think the quote mark caused the import to look for a second terminating double quote, ignoring column delimiters and end of line markers until it reached the end of the file.  When it didn't find one before the end of the file,  Im speculating that triggered the \"EOF inside a string\" error message. \n- I was able to work around the problem by setting the quotechar to be the same as the delimiter, while tells read_csv to ignore all quotes.  It now imports the file perfectly.\n- I still think \"error_bad_lines\" should catch this by checking if any row contains a column with a missing terminating quote.  \n- one reason I think this is important is that by adding a second such double quote, many lines apart, I was able to \"fool\" the system into skipping all the intervening lines, even though only two rows had an error.\n"
