I'm hopeful that users (ahem) will help in this regard\n> So I gained / provoked a post on twitter by my questions.\n\nI can give you hope: users just have to find an entry point: aplicability to own work, enough functionality and suffiecient  documentation to know how to make use of it. \n\nWhen Pandas was published first time (more or less together with the larry packages) it dd not see much applicability for my codig. Two things came together: the discontinuation of the scikits.timeseries and your ambitions to develop the best python time series library with the bridge to statistsics. \nYou can even not imagine the number applications and use case you would gain once this is more promoted in science and engineering.\n\nLast but not least, the nature of open source shows that the interest and participation indeally also follow a leaning curve: first after publishing, you'll get mostly bug reports and feature request. Once the user base is there, people's contribution gets more colourful: some wirte docs, others new features, others just report bugs...\n\nAnd pandas being a base libarary, many people will start building their libraries on top of it. together with statsmodels it's such a solid foundatdtion for data analysis, that other coders will then extend its capabilities domain specific (bioinformatics, earth observation, geoscience, etc.).\n\nFor my own libs (not yet published), I became quite good at docstring and Sphinx'ing. But first you have to understand how it works.\n\nAlso, I advice to add a link to the Numpy documentation standards to the contributors page.\n\nUff rather long here But I ain't got a blog or such...\n"

And don't worry, you aren't the first person to make tons of requests / suggestions but offer little help ;) Keep in mind how much coding work has gone into pandas over the last year and that I'm about 300 pages into a 400 page book on data analysis in Python. Plate rather full at the moment. Docs, etc will improve over time, and much faster if people who are not me or Chang get involved in the process-- we have to really be focused on shipping bug-free code and new features which is a much less accessible area of work for people to get involved (since grokking the pandas codebase, while not that complicated, is not a brief affair)\n"
