    "body": "@cpcloud What's the goal here? - Under the hood, when doing things like key lookups, Python first uses `__hash__` to find the right bin for an object, but then uses `__eq__` to test whether it's actually the same object, but it looks like Index's `__eq__` just delegates to the `ndarray` `__eq__` right? So if you use it as a key, it would end up raising the standard error about `bool(ndarray)` being undefined. You'd need to change the `__eq__` method to be able to take advantage of it as a key... (This is also why it's not vitally important for `__hash__` to be unique)  If you're doing this, you should add some tests for using the hash, like putting in sets and dicts, so you can be sure that no one changes `__eq__` - Something like these:\n\n``` python\ndef test_copies_have_same_hash():\n    df = mkdf(...)\n    ind = df.index\n    ind2 = df.copy().index\n    s = set([ind])\n    assert ind in s\n    assert ind2 in s\n```\n\n``` python\ndef  test_different_indices_can_not_look_each_other_up():\n    df = mkdf(...)\n    df2 = mkdf(...) # different length or something\n    ind = df.index\n    ind2 = df2.index\n    d = {ind: 5}\n    assert ind in s\n    assert ind2 not in s\n    assert d[ind] == 5 \n```\n\nThen you'd also have to change `Index`'s `__eq__` to be something like:\n\n``` python\ndef __eq__(self, other):\n     if issubclass(other, Index):\n          return (self.values == other.values).all()\n     else:\n          # either return False or do something else...\n```\n"

    "body": "I don't know a ton, but here's my limited understanding: hashes are sorted\ninto bins, it's important for them to (in general) be random, because you\nwant to try to put objects into separate bins because if too many end up in\nsimilar bins (same hash?), you get \"hash collisions\" which make things very\nslow because you have to do more comparisons (e.g., issues with web\nframeworks where the entire url / request header into a dictionary and so a\nmalformed request can cause huge and slow processing time). So for our\npurposes, we definitely want to create some kind of unique hash, but given\nthat under the hood there will still be an equality check, it's probably\nbetter to go for a faster hashing algorithm.  Anyways, it'll be really easy\nto write a `HashableIndex` and then you can incorporate it into what you\nare doing already :)\n\nOn Fri, Jun 14, 2013 at 7:51 PM, Phillip Cloud notifications@github.comwrote:\n\n> defaulting to repr will be slow for large indices since indexes repr valid\n> python code iirc\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/pydata/pandas/issues/3885#issuecomment-19487495\n> .\n"
