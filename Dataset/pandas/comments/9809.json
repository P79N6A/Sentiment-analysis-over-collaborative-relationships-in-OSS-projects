I am a novice when it comes to python and pandas, and when I read the documentation of a python library, I generally believe it all.  I have not really thought to myself, this is can be removed when I have read the docs.  I think the difficulty level of this task should be raised to intermediate, since you need to know how things have changed in the different pandas versions over time.\n"
