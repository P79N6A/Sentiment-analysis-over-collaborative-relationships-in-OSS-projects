    "body": "That sounds right, but then the error message is not informative and it should still be possible to output the dates as a text string with tz offset, the same way they appear when they output to the terminal. MIgrating pandas types into excel types when outputting is nice but it's not a requirement.\n\nIt's not only a xlsxwriter problem actually, xlwt and xlsxwriter fail with this error and openpyxl creates the file but throws away the timezone information, so it actually silently corrupts the data. This is a little broken all around.\n"
