    "body": "Very honestly, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this many unsigned integers. My rule of thumb is:\r\n\r\n* Use int for things that are unlikely to ever be big enough to worry about an int32 overflow (like the number of columns in a table -- if you had 2 billion columns, you would probably run into other problems sooner)\r\n* Use `int64_t` for things that are expected to be able to overflow a 32-bit signed integer\r\n* Use `size_t` exclusively when dealing with malloc, memcpy, and other C standard library functions, and for handling C++ loop indices in the STL (`for (size_t i = 0; i < foo.size(); ++i)`)\r\n\r\nIn Google's C++ style guide they say\r\n\r\n```\r\nSome people, including some textbook authors, recommend using unsigned types to represent\r\nnumbers that are never negative. This is intended as a form of self-documentation. However, in C, \r\nthe advantages of such documentation are outweighed by the real bugs it can introduce. Consider:\r\n\r\nfor (unsigned int i = foo.Length()-1; i >= 0; --i) ...\r\n\r\nThis code will never terminate! Sometimes gcc will notice this bug and warn you, but often it will not.\r\nEqually bad bugs can occur when comparing signed and unsigned variables. Basically, C's type\r\npromotion scheme causes unsigned types to behave differently than one might expect.\r\n\r\nSo, document that a variable is non-negative using assertions. Don't use an unsigned type.\r\n```"

    "body": "@wesm FWIW, almost all of the changed fields are `malloc`-ed, `memcpy`-ed or `realloc`ed (the source of the original bug). I tried to keep the surface area of the change as small as possible but still address the places where a) an int32_t would overflow and b) one would reasonably expect and `(s)size_t`.\r\n\r\nFor me, `size_t` was always seemed natural because a) it's what `malloc()` expects and b) it's what `sizeof()` returns. The reason why it is (and must be) unsigned, then, becomes clear: if it weren't, one wouldn't be able to allocate the full addressable space via `malloc()` or accurately report the size of a type greater than `int64_t` max, while both are perfectly valid uses of the respective functions (IMHO).\r\n\r\nThat said, it sounds like you're -1 on size_t, which is fine. I'll fix all changed types to be `int64_t`."

    "body": "As an aside, Google's style guide seems a bit all-over-the-map. They suggest not using unsigned types and in the very same breath dictate that assertions should be preferred for \"documenting\" a value must be non-negative. Of course, the only problem with that is `assert` is a macro dependent on the `NDEBUG` macro which itself is not part of C++ standard library. Also, I can't imagine finding a widely used version of `gcc` (well, `g++` I guess) that wouldn't warn about the type difference in a comparison of the form they present. If the compiler can't make *that* determination, you may as well just give up... :trollface: \r\n\r\nEnough bike-shedding, though! I made the requested changes and pushed. Please review at your convenience."

Then you can run the tests directly in a Windows environment on your computer.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think running tests on `Appveyor` is the only way to go ATM if you don't want to go through all that work.  What you could do (to avoid having to wait for other builds) is to make an account on AppVeyor and make a new branch that mirrors this one in the PR.  Then you you can make whatever changes you want on that branch to get tests to pass (without competing with other PR's) and then merge them into the branch for this PR."

    "body": "@jreback Note that the issue is not related to the underlying architecture of the machine. Rather, it's due to the fact that using `int`s in calls to `malloc`/`realloc` exposes you to integer overflow issues when trying to allocate anything more than `INT_MAX / 2` bytes (a 32-bit system can, by definition, store an address greater than 2^16).\r\n\r\nTo trigger the issue, one simply needs to create a CSV where at least one column is larger than `INT_MAX` bytes. However, since that value is typically exactly 2 GB, you'll need a machine with at least that much RAM. In reality, you'll need quite a bit more since a) you need to make at least one copy of the data for the parser and b) you need to make sure you don't start swapping so bad you take down the system while also avoid being killed by the `oom killer`.\r\n\r\nSo, tl;dr, any test for this issue will need to be run on a machine with sufficient RAM, where \"sufficient\" is likely in the > 6GB range."

They are not run by default as I don't want to destroy your numerous CI environments 😄 .\r\n\r\nThe new test, marked as `high_memory`, is crude but effective. The whole test takes roughly 8GB on my MBP and maybe 20 seconds to complete. I have confirmed:\r\n\r\n- If run against current `master`, the `pytest` crashes (which I think we can consider \"a failure\") as was observed in the issue\r\n- If run on the new code with `--run-highmemory` enabled, the test passes\r\n\r\nNote that since I'm not aware of a nontrivial way of constructing a test to see if the interpreter itself will crash, test coverage will likely complain that the two new `error_msg` allocations are not covered (since this code fixes both the crashes at those locations and the code that was incorrectly invoking them in the first place). I hope that's OK as I'm not sure how much more time I can devote to this specific issue."
