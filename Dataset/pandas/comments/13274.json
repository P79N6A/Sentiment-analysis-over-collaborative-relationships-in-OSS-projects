A couple of string checks shouldn't have much effect, so unless there is a strong objection, I'll leave it for now.\n\n2) I can't actually run benchmarks at the moment.  There seems to be an issue with linux-64 channels in Anaconda for `tables` and `libpython` that prevents me from running the benchmarks.  Can you confirm on a different architecture?\n\n3) Can't confirm if `+inf` is in IEEE standard (Googled \"IEEE infinity,\" and that didn't turn up anything).  _However_, `float('+inf')` does work in Python, so I guess we should accept it.  However, it is not supported in the CParser either right now, so I'll need to see where infinity parsing is done there.\n"
