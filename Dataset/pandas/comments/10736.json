    "body": "> both .iloc and .take can be views on the underlying data, depending on how selections happen and if there are multi-dtypes involved.\n\n@jreback This behavior is very surprising to me. I assumed that pandas follows the NumPy rules for copies/views with `iloc`/`take`. That is, `take` always returns a copy and `iloc` returns views only if all indexers are slices or integers.\n\nIf we have places where we are trying to convert array indexers into slices so we can do a view in `iloc`/`take`, those should be eliminated.\n"

Surely we've all lost track of warning outputs in a stream of output, no?\n\n(I'm thinking about my colleagues in the social sciences -- this just seems the kind of subtle and potentially unnecessarily complicated behavior that will really throw them for a loop)\n"

    "body": "@nickeubank this is the fundamental design of numpy. Its less than ideal but generally not a problem. The warning never used to exists and we would get questions, like: why does this not set?\n\ne.g.\n\n`df['foo']['bar'] = 10`.\n\nWhen it would work if it was a view, but the second someone added another dtype it would then not work.\n\nThe thing is you HAVE/WANT to always use views as they are extremely cheap. Otherwise you end up copying everywhere which is bad.\n"
