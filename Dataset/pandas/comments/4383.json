    "body": "Looking through the code for `urlparse`, I see just a `ValueError` being thrown for a bad IPv6 address in `urlsplit`. I think I wrote this. `git blame` will show @jreback because I think he moved it to `pandas/io/common.py` a while back. `urlparse` is crazy liberal with what it accepts. E.g., `urlparse.urlparse('()(*#@%&*888888#@$^)*)(*asdfs09df8s0dg98')` doesn't throw.\n"
