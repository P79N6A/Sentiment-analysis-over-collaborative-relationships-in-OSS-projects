    "body": "The use case is the following: I have a metric that can be calculated on different frequencies (daily, hourly, monthly). The thing is that a different filtering needs to happen depending on the frequency: if the metric is calculated hourly, then all data points after 18:00 or before 8:00 for a given day need to be filtered out. This cannot happen if the metric has been calculated daily, since the timestamps will look like `2014-09-27 00:00`, so the filtering would effectively wipe out all data.\n\nSo basically I need to know, given a datetimeindex, if its frequency ir more os less granular than a day.\n"
