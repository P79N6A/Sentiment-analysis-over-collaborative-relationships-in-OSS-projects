    "body": "yes, for more control over the conversion the `.format` is certainly the preferred way to do, but for consistency with series this would be good.\n\nSomething else I was thinking: we are now using the numpy machinery I suppose to do the conversion, with the result that this also uses the odd numpy representation in local time:\n\n```\n`In [46]: s.astype(str)[0]\nOut[46]: '2012-01-01T01:00:00.000000000+0100'\n\nIn [47]: str(s[0])\nOut[47]: '2012-01-01 00:00:00'\n```\n\nWould it be possible to also have the second output for `astype`?\n"

Further I really though that we added `.strptime`, but if we didn't ok. should also expose this as `Series.dt.format` then. I'll add a list to the top. All these pretty straightforward.\n"
