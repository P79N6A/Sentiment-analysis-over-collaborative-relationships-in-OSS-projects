For any survey dataset, one-size fits all usually won't work (regardless of the default) and the easiest thing will be to use what works best and then change some columns ex post. \n\nWhy these two? \n- drop_order() for unordered Categoricals like gender\n- reverse_order() because often the numbers used for an ordinal ranking will be in arbitrary order. E.g., the self-reported health example (excellent, very good, ..., poor) you may find in Stata coded as 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -- whatever the data producer thought looked best in Stata output. When Pandas displays the latter coding, excellent < very good < ... < poor looks odd.\n  Both are probably just syntactic sugar, but they'd be much easier to work with than what I would guess how it could be done now.\n"
