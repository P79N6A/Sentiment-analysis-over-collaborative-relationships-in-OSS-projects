    "body": "- cut produces an unordered cat: That it isn't ordered is simple an oversight on my part when I changed the cut to the new fastpath constructor and forgot to specify ordered.\n- re labels: labels as a name is used at quite a lot places in pandas and I haven't really tried to understand why they are called 'labels'. @jreback can probably say more about this...\n- re produce a Series: IMO it would be nice to return a Series, if the input was a Series and a Categorical in all else cases (\"Categorical\" is usually used like a np.array)\n"

    "body": "Ah, ok, then in this case labels are actually used as \"description for something\" and my misunderstandings come from different places, where it is an array of ints used in indexing and what was cat.labels in the old Categorical :-)\n\nR's factor has two inputs: `levels` and `labels`. Levels are first used to construct levels from the data and labels are then used to rename the levels (so after applying labels, you don't have any references to the original level names).\n\n`factor(vals, levels=levels, labels=labels)` is translated into current pandas as \n\n``` python\ncat = pd.Categorical(val, levels=levels)\ncat.levels = labels\n```\n\nSo in this cases I think it makes sense to use either `levels` or (if this is renamed) `categories`.\n"

    "body": "On the renaming of `labels` (**only!** in this `cut` function), I provided my reasoning here: https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/8153#discussion_r16955378 as answer on \n\n> (on the return of 'integer bin labels' with `labels=False` in `cut`) This is actually an example of \"0,1,...integer labels\", which is used throughout the pandas codebase, where I find the usage of \"labels\" irritating. In most of the places in pandas, they are used as \"0,1,... labels which indicate in which group a row belongs\". I actually start to read \"labels = group indicator\".\n\nBut _exactly_ for that reason, I would change the name `labels` to `levels/categories`. Because now, you normally provide a list of categories/levels to `labels` (and so _not_ labels as it is used elsewhere, and also not how it was used in Categorical, because there it was what is now called `codes`). Only when providing `labels=False` (which I would interprete as 'no labels'), the output becomes something label-like .. (in the sense how it is used elsewhere in pandas). \n"
