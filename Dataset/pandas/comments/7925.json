    "body": "OK, I see what's going on. The way the code works, when you call `rolling_*(arg, ..., center=True/False)` it first does the rolling calculations with the final window ending on the final element of `arg`. If `center=False` it simply labels the rows by the last value of the window, and stops there. If `center=True`, it relabels the rows based on the center of each window, filling in `NaN`s where necessary. Thus the `center` argument affects only the labeling/alignment of results, not their calculation.\n\nSo in the example provided, regardless of the value of `center`, the final calculated value is based on a window on [7.0, 8.0, 9.0], producing a mean of 8.0. With the default `center=False`, this would lead to row `9` having a value of 8.0. With `center=True`, this leads to row `8` having a value of 8.0, and row `9` is filled in with `NaN`.\n\nNow, clearly what you're expecting is that in the `center=True` case it calculate the row `9` value as the mean of a final window [8.0, 9.0, NaN]. But the code isn't set up to do that.\n\nI suppose that in the `center=True` case we could first pad the input data with an additional window/2 `NaN`s, do the calculations, and then adjust the indexes. I can't think of any obvious problems, other than performance issues, which probably aren't severe. (Note that most `expanding_*` functions are implemented in terms of the corresponding `rolling_*` functions with `window=len(arg)`, so this has the potential to increase the data size by 50% when `center=True`. Though I suppose you could argue that the extra calculations are justified/required.) Ideally someone with more knowledge of the `center` parameter (@changhiskhan?) can opine.\n"

    "body": "Come to think of it, the `expanding_mean(..., center=True)` results look just plain odd, notwithstanding the final `NaN`s. There's no way in !$# that anyone would want that. I understand why they are the way they are: `expanding_*(arg, ...)` is calculated as `rolling_*(arg, ..., window=len(arg), min_periods=0)`, so everything is shifted by a _fixed_ `(len(arg)-1)/2`. I suppose the \"right\" thing to do is to \"halve\" the indices, rather than shift them, but  it still seems sort of odd.\n\nPerhaps best simply to remove the `center` argument from all the `expanding_*` functions? (I'm not sure it's that easy, the way the code is written, but ignore that for now.) Given the odd behavior, I very much doubt anyone is using them with `center=True`.\n"
