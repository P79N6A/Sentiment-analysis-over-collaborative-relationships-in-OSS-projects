    "body": "When you don't specify a delimiter, the Python engine will try to \"sniff\" it out from the first line using the `Sniffer` class from Python's built-in `csv` library.  The reason I think you're getting this error is because the sniffer cannot tell what delimiter you want:\n\n``` python\n>>> import csv\n>>> line = 'name\\n'`  # that is your first line\n>>> print(csv.Sniffer().sniff(line).delimiter)\n'n'\n```\n\nI would not consider this a bug because your data does not provide sufficient information for parsing a delimiter of any kind, nor is the problem originating in the actual `pandas` implementation.  I think as you did, specifying the delimiter, will get around this issue.\n"
