    "body": "Thanks for the quick reply.\n\nI'm a physicist having no experience in collaborating on such a big project as pandas. Sure I would like to gain some experience by improving the docs, but I need to learn how.\n\nAlso, the problem I have goes a tiny step further than the SO question. I am parsing log-files (1.5k files with 100M lines in total; 12GB is the total size of all files) into a dataframe, so I can get some insight into our experiment. I am parsing the log files one by one, and would like to append them to a table in a HDF5 file. A part of each log message, is the _name of the process_, which created the message. And I know there are a lot less names of processes than lines. So I thought using Categoricals is feasible here. (It might just be another form of efficient string storage .. I don't know... ) \n\nI have no way of knowing the complete set of categories in advance. From your SO answer, I learned how to create the following Categoricals using an explicit set of categories. But I have not yet understood how/if I can append following Categoricals to a Table in an HDF5 file \n\n(I should add an example here)\n"
