    "body": "Thanks, jreback for the very quick reply.\nI suspect you may have misunderstood the issue. In any case, in v0.14.1 I still see the same problem.\n\n[Note, this is my 1st time working with github or reporting an issue, so bear with me if there's any conventions I am unaware of.]\n\nThe problem is that in _stocks_, if there is even only 1 value equal to _nan_, then the _Entire_ set of results is discarded and an error is returned.\nWhat would be better, is if the good data was returned, and only the _nan_ data was discarded.\n\nFor example, the below works. I indicate lines I changed compared to v0.14.1.\n\n```\ndef _dl_mult_symbols(symbols, start, end, chunksize, retry_count, pause,\n                     method):\n    stocks = {}\n    for sym_group in _in_chunks(symbols, chunksize):\n        for sym in sym_group:\n            try:\n                stocks[sym] = method(sym, start, end, retry_count, pause)\n            except IOError:\n                warnings.warn('Failed to read symbol: {0!r}, omitting from '    # <---\n                              'data set.'.format(sym), SymbolWarning)           # <---\n                pass # <-- More a hack than a proper fix, \n                         # but I would rather leave this to experienced people than suggest amateur solutions.\n\n    try:\n        return Panel(stocks).swapaxes('items', 'minor')\n    except AttributeError:\n        # cannot construct a panel with just 1D nans indicating no data\n        raise RemoteDataError(\"No data fetched using \"\n                              \"{0!r}\".format(method.__name__))\n\n```\n"

Your soln is not actually what we want here, rather returning a Panel with missing values for the non-returned data.\n\nPls feel free to work on this.\n"
