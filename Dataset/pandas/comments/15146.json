Would you want to change the return value of `resample` to have a PeriodIndex instead of DatetimeIndex? That would be a big change. \r\nOr would you just want to change when you access a scalar value and get a Timestamp object, to change this in a Period object if the timestamp has a `freq` ? But then you would be getting Periods out of a DatetimeIndex with freq, which seems not very consistent."

Because we generally use contiguous indexes, it also is used as the frequency of those intervals. (It could be theoretically be possible to have a PeriodIndex which is Monday every week, for example)"

It isn't recognized by any of the special constructors `now`, `today`, ... or `replace`.  `pd.DatetimeIndex([ts])` doesn't check for `ts.freq`.\r\n\r\nNone of these are big deals, but are sufficiently sub-optimal that I can offer the OP moral support.\r\n\r\n> `freq` on a `Timestamp` is a informative label at most, but doesn't change the value.\r\n\r\nThe only behavior that is affected is `__add__` and `__sub__`, where adding/subtracting integers is defined if `freq` is not `None`.  In that sense it behaves a lot like `Period`."
