    "body": "My testing of the 0.20.0 release candidate uncovered a large number of breakages in both dask and odo.\r\n\r\nI completely understand the need for refactoring but I *really* don't think it's good practice to simply break non-deprecated apis without any warning especially with a library as far down the stack as pandas. I think  this is especially true when it's a fairly simple task to provide a shim module with a warning to at least give 3rd parties a chance to make the necessary changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides the necessary shims for me to get both dask and odo working.\r\n\r\n"
