Otherwise you miss all the platform-specific issues that it could turn up, including the thing where `test_on_offset_implementations` has to be marked `strict=False` because it only fails on *some* operating systems.\r\n\r\nIf you feel that property-based tests are going to be valuable - and there are obvious applications to testing e.g. round-tripping serialization that I couldn't get to pass - personally I'd just make Hypothesis a lightweight required dependency for development.  Happy to let you decide either way though!"
