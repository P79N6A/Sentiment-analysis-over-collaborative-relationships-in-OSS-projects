I agree if there is no legend then there is no explicit way the person viewing the plot knows what is plotted against what, but I guess I wish it was hackable so I could do it anyway and then explain it in the figure description.\n\nUnfortunately for me, I can't transform the data as it's one of many plots I'll have for a publication and they all need to be the same style.\n\nThanks for the help.\n"

The only other thing I can think of is to append a `(right axis)` to the x-axis label, but this doesn't feel great.\n\nThere are certainly ways around this if you drop down to matplotlib though. I may have a chance later to take a crack at your SO questoin.\n"
