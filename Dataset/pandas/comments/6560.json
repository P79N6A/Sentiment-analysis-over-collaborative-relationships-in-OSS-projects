    "body": "@cancan101 - I played with your suggestion a little bit as it sounded cool, but after working through some examples I'm not sure I am in favor of it. In my understanding, Timestamps represent an instant in time, whereas Periods represent a span of time, and I think we should present these differently to users.\n\nOne may have monthly samples of some quantity, but if it's actually a point-in-time sample, taken at say the end of the month vs the start of the month, I think I'd like to see that daily level of detail rather than just seeing the month. If one instead is working with some quantity averaged over the month (e.g. average temperature over a month) then it makes more sense to just show the month, but then I think one should be using a Period rather than a Timestamp.\n\nAdmittedly I haven't played with Periods much, I've just read about them in the Python for Data Analysis book.\n"
