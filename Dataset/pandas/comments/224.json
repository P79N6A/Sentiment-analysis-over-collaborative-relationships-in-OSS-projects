    "body": "Yes, I am thinking of scatter plots - they're the commonest type of plot in my field. The `plot(soy_w['Depth'])` was just a minimal example to show the bug - I was actually trying to do `plot(soy_w['Depth'], soy_w['OtherColumn'])`.\n\nWould it make sesnse to fall back to an array if we try to index to additional axes? The key is mpl calling `y = y[:,np.newaxis]`. Even if this is just a temporary measure while we get matplotlib to handle pandas structures better, I think it's pretty critical to work well with matplotlib.\n"

I guess it's sort of my own fault for breaking the ndarray interface in **getitem**, but I think it's a worthwhile tradeoff. I think we can put in a hack without breaking any unit tests, will take a look later today (after I get my PyCon proposals done)\n"
