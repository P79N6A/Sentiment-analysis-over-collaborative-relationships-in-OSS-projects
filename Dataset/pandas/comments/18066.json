I think in the interest of modularity, we would probably want to move away from incorporating giant chunks of code into our codebase.\r\n\r\nThat being said, we *could* add functions that *call* those function from something like `tabulate` or `PrettyPandas` (assuming they're installed).  However, we would probably need to choose one or the other (or make a uniform API to be able to call both)."
