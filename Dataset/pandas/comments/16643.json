    "body": "Not sure if it matters in this case, but in general you don't want to use mutable values as defaults in python, as they are bound at function declaration time and can be subsequently modified. e.g. described here\r\nhttp://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/writing/gotchas/\r\n\r\nSo the pattern we are using here is correct.  Thanks for the PR, certainly welcome other code cleanups if you see them!"
