Two questions.\r\n\r\nOne: there are a couple of tests in series.test_operators `test_datetime64_ops_nat` that specifically check for the return type to be datetime64.  Sure the behavior isn't intentional?\r\n\r\nTwo: also in `test_datetime64_ops_nat` are tests for `-pd.NaT + Series[datetime64]`.  Should that also be changed to return `Series[timedelta64]`?"
