I do see some test failures related to this change, e.g.:\r\n\r\nAssertionError: Pattern 'Attributes are different' not found in 'DataFrame.iloc[:, 0] are different\r\n\r\nPerhaps this example also suggests that the error messages will be more readable if they still mention \"Attributes\".\r\n\r\nI will try to close this now and be more careful next time about running all the relevant tests."
