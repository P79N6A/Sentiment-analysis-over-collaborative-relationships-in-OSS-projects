    "body": "Indeed integer NAs is one thing that I \"can't do\" with pandas right now. The choice is between float arrays with NAs or object arrays with integers plus float NaNs or some other NA sentinel. The NA-capable dtypes in upcoming NumPy 1.7 and beyond may provide a solution, but I have yet to explore concretely. It's still going to be a bit of a disaster catching interactions between integer and float arrays (right now float array + float array -> NAs propagate). Anyway, I'm not happy with the solution (or any of the other options), but this one seems to cause the least amount of problems. \n"
