    "body": "Apologies I pushed a few \"fixes\" for some unit tests which were failing. Looking at the reason why those tests were failing I've noticed it was because of the use of the argument 'keys' in the function 'concat'. Most people are using it to pass the column names, which is something I personally don't do and therefore I didn't consider when writing the code. I'm going to reset my local branch to commit 'b9cba86ec1c11c200c44c62d0a300b7f326a12e4' and make the necessary changes to allow this case. Before sending the next pull request I'm going to make sure all nosetests pass correctly. This should also fix the build issue. Apologies again, this is due to lack of experience. I'll make sure to learn from my mistake.\n"

    "body": "I see the branch has conflicts. I'm assuming in this sort of situations I need to fix those myself right?\n\nIn the effort of solving them using `git mergetool` I've noticed that sometimes there are pieces of code in my LOCAL branch which are not present in the REMOTE, but I haven't create them myself. What I usually do is to update my master branch:\n\n```\n# go to the master branch\ngit checkout master\n# pull changes from github\ngit fetch upstream\n# update the master branch\ngit rebase upstream/master\n# push it to your Github repo\ngit push\n```\n\nThen I update the local branch:\n\n```\n# go to the feature branch\ngit checkout my-new-feature\n# make a backup in case you mess up\ngit branch tmp my-new-feature\n# rebase on master\ngit rebase master\n```\n\nThe `rebase` will fail and suggest me to use `mergetool` to solve the conflicts manually. Now, how should I behave in situations like the one in the attached picture?\n\n![screenshot from 2015-08-19 08 42 41](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4025968/9351185/3cc512ba-464f-11e5-978b-c8c8a4278ecd.png)\n\nIn the picture above the document on the left is my local, the one in the middle is the result of the merge, and the one on the right is the remote. In this occasions I tend to pick from the remote everything I don't have in my local branch, because I assume these are coming from other submitted pull requests or code merged while I was working on my local branch. What about the code which is in my local, hasn't been written by me, and is not in the remote?  Should I discard it?\n"
