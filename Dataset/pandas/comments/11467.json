However there are more than 400 lines that have a \"\\x00\" as terminator. read_csv gives error because it is not treating \"\\0\" as line terminator.\nI want to have \"\\n\" or \"\\0\" as line terminator.\n\nAlso even if i explicitly use lineterminator=\"\\0\" in read_csv(), looks like it is not treating \"\\0\" as terminator\n\nThis lines below gives me the same error. (cup98LRN.txt is in the zip file). the file has \"\\n\" as line terminator in most lines. about 400 lines has \"\\0\" line terminator.\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('cup98LRN.txt')\ndf = pd.read_csv('cup98LRN.txt', lineterminator=\"\\0\")\n\n**CParserError: Error tokenizing data. C error: Expected 481 fields in line 579, saw 96**\nso it means adding line terminator has no effect.\n\n1) I want to tell read_csv to treat \"\\0\" along with \"\\n\" as line terminator.\n\nunix commands wc - l treats \"\\n\" and \"\\0\" as line terminator and gives me appropriate number of lines.\n"
