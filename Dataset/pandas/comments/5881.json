    "body": "Parking this here because it's a similar issue. I just ran into this now that `read_stata` correctly returns float32 (default in stata). `expanding_apply` and friends always return float (64-bit on my machine).\n\nI was doing an expanding_apply on a series via groupby and it borked because it can't safely cast 64-bit to 32-bit. The workaround is to cast the series beforehand to float64, but it might be nice if you can specify the return type of your function beforehand. \n\nI think the solution would just be a matter of adding a few different version of `algos.roll_generic` and having a return_type argument to the (generic) rolling functions. E.g., return_type in [None, np.float32, np.float64, ...]. AFAIK there's no good way at runtime to determine the return type of the function.\n"
