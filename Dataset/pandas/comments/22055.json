    "body": "Great point, but it's a very common need in the science field. I currently have to read in the file once to grab the header, pull out and store the information as variables, or use the information as a check. \r\n\r\nFor example, pull out the first commented line from two different files (such as VCF and FASTA), and make sure the reference build matches, as there is no sense in continuing a pipeline if one genome is human and the other is canine. \r\n\r\nI suppose you could easily just store the commented lines as a string and let the user parse the info from there. It would save I/O on reopening a file more than once.. and most of the files I deal with are upwards of 30 gigs each. For the love of science? \r\n\r\n"
