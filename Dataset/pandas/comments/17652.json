From what I can tell most of the errors there would be simple like `E225 missing whitespace operator`\r\n\r\nRelatively minor but having worked on some pyx files recently including those in `lint-diff` in the Makefile would be nice. Very clean and easy if we don't need to select a bunch of codes as we currently do in `ci/lint.sh` \r\n\r\nHappy to knock out some of those pyx files if you need help. Let me know."
