    "body": "@wesm as an aside...a similar method to what I did here could be used to support the NaN concept directly in Int columns. If one were to create a NaT like object (maybe NaI) for ints...(which could be the maxint for that type...would have for int8,int16,int32,int64)....then this would be straightforward. Then the dtypes of the series (and underlying numpy array) would be correct (e.g. say int64 or whatever), the NaI would fit it; and just intercept calls to np.nan to translate both ways.\n\nNot a big believer in explict type handling, but I think you have to, to get pure numpy arrays (rathern than object).\n\njust a thought - not sure how much folks are clamoring for NaN in pure int columns\n"

    "body": "Merged. thanks. more generally all of the data management /NA handling needs to get revamped at some point to prevent a mountain of little hacks from coming around. NA values in int arrays is important to a lot of people but the problem is the reliance on numpy internally. pandas needs to take ownership of its own data. a big project \n"
