Would rather have two dupes than no issue being reported at all!\r\n\r\nFor the workaround I was referring https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/21075#issuecomment-389484883, or in you case:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf.groupby([df.Date.dt.year.rename('year'), df.Date.dt.month.rename(month')]).mean()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suspect the PR is tacking on 0,1,... since that handles things most generically, and it corresponds to the level enumeration of a `MultiIndex`.\r\n\r\nAs to why something like `df.Date.dt.year` doesn't automatically change the name?  I don't know for sure, but I suspect it's a combination of: \r\n\r\n1) I don't know of a well agreed upon convention of how to rename (rename entirely, add suffixes, etc.)\r\n2) There's a `rename` method that's easily chainable to explicitly accommodate any desired renaming\r\n3) Probably best to retain existing behavior in the absence of a clearly better alternative\r\n\r\nThat being said, feel free to open a new issue if you feel strongly about automatically renaming these things."
