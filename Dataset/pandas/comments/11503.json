    "body": "@chris-b1 I suspect that you're right that it would be easiest to re-save into a supported format, but there are several problems that remain. The problem for me comes from the fact that I'm using this to teach a course that students are supposed to get this data themselves and to learn to use the `read_excel` function to read in Excel files found in the wild. Requiring them to own a copy of Excel and to re-save these files into a different Excel format is uninspiring. \n\nFurther, I'm not sure why @jreback closed this issue, has it been resolved? Or is it out of scope in some way? As I see it, the decision should be driven by the following questions: \n1. Is the file a valid Excel file? \n   \n   a. If not, it's a file corruption problem and not a problem with `pandas` (this issue should be closed).\n   \n   b. If so (Excel seems to think so, as it opens w/o error), and it is unreadable by `pandas`, then this issue should remain unresolved until it can be read by the `pandas` function `read_excel`.\n   \n   c. A final option is that the library that `pandas` relies on is the culprit, and so while the bug appears in a `pandas` call, it comes from an underlying source (and the issue should be closed in the `pandas` and opened in the appropriate library).\n\nAm I missing some consideration? And if not, why is the issue currently closed?\n"
