No strong feelings either way, having pandas objects populated with\nnon-native datatypes is a fringe use-case so, whatever.\n\nas stated in #3251, pprint_dict didn't enfrorce a limit on nested sequences, which can\nmake the terminal choke on nasty datasets. But again it's not _that_ interesting in practice.\n\nIf someone wants to pick this up for 0.14 - great, if not can close next time you go through stale issues.\n"
