    "body": "Yes this is correct git usage :) \n\nThe problem with this is that as soon as you do anything with the DataFrame you've created the column metadata is going to be lost. Probably the right way to do it would be to store the information _inside the column index_ itself. So it's a bit of an involved undertaking. I will take a closer look at your patch and think about how much work it would be to do \n"
