I read the task you linked and had to find that given the other two issues my understanding of the correct behavior was wrong.\n\nI will change the behavior to be:\n\n```\nidx = pd.Index([1,2,3], name='a')\nidx2 = pd.Index([4,5,6], name='b')\nidx3 = pd.Index([1,2,3], name='a')\nL = [1]\n\nidx.union(idx2).name\n#None\nidx.union(idx3).name\n#a\nidx.union(L)\n#a\n\nidx.intersection(idx2).name\n#None\nidx.intersection(idx3).name\n#a\nidx.intersection(L).name\n#a\n```\n\nRight now index.union(array) is crashing, I fixed that while changing the naming issue. Please let me know if that is intended or not.\n\nI am rerunning the tests, will add above mentioned test cases and reissue a pull request later.\n"
