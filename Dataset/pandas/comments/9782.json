Unfortunately, this is how Python defines `~` for booleans:\n\n```\nIn [20]: ~False\nOut[20]: -1\n\nIn [21]: ~True\nOut[21]: -2\n```\n\nWe could do more aggressive dtype inference to cast the first array to `dtype=bool`, but would likely have severe negative performance implications.\n"

    "body": "This makes sense. \n\nOne could argue that this behavior is really a consequence of overloading `~` as logical not. In fact, if `~False=-1`, then it seems like it's more consistent to produce `-1` than `False` when applying `~` to a boolean array.\n\nWhat I'd like to have is some function or operator equivalent to `s.map(lambda x: not x)`, and probably a warning to be careful when using `~` on booleans. This function/operator could check the dtype, and, if it's bool, it could run whatever efficient algorithm is currently being used. (I'm just speculating, since I don't know the actual inner workings.)\n"
