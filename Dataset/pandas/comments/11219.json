    "body": "I had problems building pandas (`python setup.py develop`), but I managed to locally build pandas, see below.\n\n**Test problem and solution**\nThe test error was caused because the compressed file was opened as read-only. I had to change the `mode` argument used to create compressed file handles in `pandas.core.common._get_handle()`. The function has a mode arg, but it was overriding it with `rb` for compressed files. \nAnyway, thanks for helping me out with this!!\n\n**Build problem and solution**\nBuilding on my Windows laptop, I had other versions of `gcc.exe` installed. Calling `which gcc` should return `C:\\Anaconda\\envs\\pandas_dev\\MinGW\\bin\\gcc.exe` (depending on the path to Anaconda). \nOn my system I had to manually add `C:\\Anaconda\\envs\\pandas_dev\\MinGW\\bin` to the begining of `PATH`:\n\n```\nset PATH=C:\\Anaconda\\envs\\pandas_dev\\MinGW\\bin;%PATH%\n```\n\nand if you already tried `python setup.py develop` once, then you probably need to do `python setup.py clean` before trying again.\n"
