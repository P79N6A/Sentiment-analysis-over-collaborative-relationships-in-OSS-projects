    "body": "@jbrockmendel to come back to your points why this is an improvement\r\n\r\n> The long-term goal of ripping out the BlockManager will be made easier if core.internals is better isolated from the rest of the code.\r\n\r\nBut Blocks and the BlockManager would be ripped out together, so they are already isolated in that sense. And the code / implementation of both are strongly intertwined., slitting those both up does make it IMO not easier to work with.\r\n\r\n> The Block classes themselves need a lot of work\r\n\r\nIn general, by using extension arrays for our internal ones, the code in the specific Blocks should decrease, as we should move towards using ExtensionBlock for all those.\r\n\r\nSo I am still not convinced of the benefit of this change in general (there might be smaller (eg generally useable) parts that can be refactored / moved out)."

Wether / IF block manager is every completely removed is completely not the point here. In order to even attempt that, you have to gradually move away from it. So making code more clear is the first step.\r\n\r\nTrying to make sweeping changes is always a disaster, they take too long to review and are very disruptive.
