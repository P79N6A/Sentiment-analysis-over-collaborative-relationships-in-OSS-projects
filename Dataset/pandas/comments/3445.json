We could then have a separate set of maintainers take primary responsibility for that module (and be able to more easily bring in the kinds of things that @olgabot, @TomAugspurger  and I believe @JanSchulz have worked on on and off).\n\nAlternatively, I get the sense that rplot was trying to bring in some of the concepts that the `ggplot` port would now cover, so maybe we could bring it in that way.\n"

And hasn't changed the last year since that comment (https://github.com/pydata/pandas/commits/master/pandas/tools/rplot.py). While there are some open issues with bugs about this.\n- above there was spoken about splitting it off in seperate projects (eg a ggplot-like one). In the meantime, I think, these projects have already emerged, most notably in python-ggplot and seaborn I think (among probably others)\n\n**So**: would deprecating the trellis rplot interface in pandas make sense?\n\n@orbitfold You are the original author of this I think. What is your opinion on this? \n@jtratner @JanSchulz \n\nAs proposed by @TomAugspurger in #8351, we could make a doc section showing for each example of the current pandas trellis interface, how to do the equivalent using python-ggplot and/or seaborn for easy transitioning.\n"
