(see original stack overflow thread)  For myself I have gotten around this by preprocessing the file before loading into pandas. I imagine that files like these will be rare enough that a work around in read_tables() may not be worth it, However, I will leave this bug's fate to to more knowledgeable people.\n"

    "body": "Yeah, unfortunately since the spaces in the final column aren't quoted there is no workaround available for read_table. However, given that your columns are fixed width, you can use read_fwf as an alternative to preprocessing the file manually.\n\nI'm closing this issue but please feel free to leave any additional feedback. Thanks.\n"
