    "body": "Agreed that the docs could be better here. I originally didn't include any examples since the return value is just `self`, and you wouldn't actually see anything. Might not hurt take an example from the [example notebook](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.17.1/style.html), and take some of the `Note` under the class docstring and copy it to `apply` and `applymap`. Interested in submitting a fix?\n\nAnd for your problem with the `ufloat`s, that's just a design error on my part. I'lll get a PR up soon with a `Styler.format` method that will be what you want. You pass in your regular string formatting template, e.g. `df.style.format('{:.2%}'`).\n"

    "body": "Yeah, it will take a callable or a string format spec. I think in this case you could use the string format. So if your uncertainly column is called `margin` you'd have `df.style.format({'margin': '±{:.2f}'})` and that will be applied to the column (assuming the `uncertainties` package has hooked up `__format__` to work like that, I haven't tried). Otherwise you can use a callable taking a single value and returning a string.\n\nEdit: Just looked at uncertainties, looks like you would have to use a callable here.\n"
