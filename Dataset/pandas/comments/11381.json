    "body": "That's a very strange definition of private. Anything that doesn't start with an underscore and is in the main namespace is public simply by being there in pretty much any Python project I know. And in this case the `write_version` approach was simply copied from numpy/scipy, where the `version` module is definitely public. \n\nBut well, it's up to you to decide here...\n"
