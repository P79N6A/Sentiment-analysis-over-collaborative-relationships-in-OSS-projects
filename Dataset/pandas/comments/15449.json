There is no equivalent for Months or Quarters for example. It seems like it would make sense to have `Week`, `WeekEnd` and `WeekBegin`, but I'm not sure if that would cause confusion.\r\n- How often are people using aliases vs offsets? "

So we could deprecate the latter, in favor of `WeekEnd(weekday=3)`.\r\n\r\n>Would it be confusing to have WeekEnd (would people think it refers to weekends)?\r\n\r\nNot ideal, but not sure if there's a better name.\r\n\r\n>How often are people using aliases vs offsets?\r\n\r\nAliases are likely used more, for ranges and resampling, but at least personally, I use offsets fairly frequently for shifting dates.\r\n```\r\ndf['date_plus_1yr'] = df['date'] + pd.DateOffset(years=1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n"

Would we want to add those as well? (although I don't see much benefit from those when you could do any of that directly with `DateOffset`). I think the `anchored` functionality is more interesting, so `WeekEnd` and `WeekBegin` might work well; and I like the idea of deprecating the 'fixed' use of `Week`.\r\n\r\n"
