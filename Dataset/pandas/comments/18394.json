    "body": "@PMeira Why was the behavior of Series.plot.bar changed to plot bars with different color. Visually these colors add nothing and add to clutter in the chart. Different colors should only be used when they correspond to differences of meaning in the data.\r\n\r\nWhy is the default behavior to provide an unnecessarily visually overwhelming graph? It took me some time to realize why my bars suddenly started acting strangely. Now, I pass color='cornflowerblue' to get all my bars the same pleasant hue.\r\n\r\nReference for visual appeal and the use of colors: http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/rules_for_using_color.pdf\r\n"

It appears that @pcluo is correct about the matplotlib issue.\r\n\r\nI tested with matplotlib 2.1.0 and pandas 0.22.0 and reproduced a similar issue\r\n![oldversuion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31365056/45718897-45fafb00-bb64-11e8-8ab5-a532a317ddf5.PNG)\r\n\r\nThen I tested matplotlib 2.2.2 and pandas 0.22.0 and no issue.\r\n![newversion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31365056/45718990-907c7780-bb64-11e8-8ae6-15aeda54bdaf.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\nI also had matplotlib 2.2.2 and pandas 0.20.3 and had no issue, so I think matplotlib may be the culprit.\r\n![third](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31365056/45719074-cd486e80-bb64-11e8-8f80-88d5adb64676.PNG)\r\n\r\nHope that provides some useful information!"
