    "body": "Your file has two literal backslashes but an `escapechar` can only be one character. The fact that you send two backslashes as an argument is required only to escape it as a single character.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is a bug as much as a mismatch in expectations. Since `escapechar` only supports one character you'll most likely have to choose a different escape char for your csv file, or cleanse it before reading into pandas"

If not, at least I'd need for an explanation for a bizarre behavior."
