    "body": "that is  a bug. Their is a whole set of logic to properly handle division by 0 property (as numpy doesn't handle integer division correctly). And fill appropriately with +-inf/NaN as appropriate.\n\nThese both should yield the same as `[5]`\n\nThis op is handled as `__rdiv__` IOW, a reversed division op. And I think the logic is a bit off for this case.\n\nWelcome to have you dive in if you'd like.\n"
