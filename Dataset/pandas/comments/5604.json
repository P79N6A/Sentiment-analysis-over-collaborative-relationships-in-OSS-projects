    "body": "@jreback, a blacklist was created to block access to some methods while deprecating access to others (my interpretation of the comments in #5480).  In summary, the changes in this PR are:\n1. add the following methods to the groupby whitelist:\n   \n   ```\n   'dtypes', 'value_counts', 'mad', 'any', 'all', 'irow', 'take', 'shift', 'tshift', 'ffill', 'bfill', 'pct_change', 'skew', 'corr', 'corrwith', 'cov'\n   ```\n2. create a blacklist to block access to:\n   `'eval', 'query', to_*`\n3. change AttributeError to a DeprecationWarning when accessing methods not in either whitelist or blacklist\n\nRe: testing, I added a new commit to this PR with improved whitelist testing (the full whitelist is hard-coded in the test suite now and compared to the defined whitelist).  Since some methods in the whitelist are unique to Series or DataFrame, the whitelist needed to be refactored a bit, but that should clean up erroneous tab completion results (i.e., dtype on a DataFrameGroupBy object).\n\nLet me know if I should back out changes 2 & 3, or if there are any other suggestions.\n"
