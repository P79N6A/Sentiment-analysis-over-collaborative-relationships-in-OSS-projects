    "body": "AFAIK the \"correct\" way to do this is to state `closes #2781` or `fixes #2781` in your commit message in which case GitHub will automatically add a reference to this issue in your PR and will automatically close this issue when your PR gets merged into upstream. The reason this isn't being done is because you're missing the `#` symbol in front of the issue number.\n\nI think it would be a bit premature to close the issue before PR is merged, but I'm watching the PR & am happy to close once it gets merged. \n"
