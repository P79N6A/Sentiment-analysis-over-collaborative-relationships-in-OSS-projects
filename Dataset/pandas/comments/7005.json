Only `left`/`right` seems better, but also not fully sure.\n\nI think we should think a bit more carefully about this, also related to the default DataFrame display (#6547) and the issues @jreback linked to. \nEg something like `df.show('left')`, `df.show('lowerright')`, @michaelaye would this also do? Or this maybe misses the convenience of being able to tab complete and it is not that usefull anymore this way?\n\nAlso, if the default DataFrame display will be truncated centrally (#5603), you actually already have somehow left and right in one view?\n"

    "body": "`df.show('left')` is of course quite longer than `df.left()` and not tab-completed.\nBut I totally agree that my feeble attempts here pale in comparison with the linked solutions. As I already noted my feeling that my hacks left me desired to have more specific views in terms of the corners, hence I find one command that can show me the corner cases extremely valuable.\n\nTo motivate this further, real-time data analysis is a lot about understanding what your current operation is doing to the data, and a quick view showing me all 4 corners goes a long way towards this. \n\nIn this respect, if this can be implemented with one extra command and the default being to show me 2 or 3 rows or columns in the corners, I'm all for it and would recommend to reject my PR. But I also would like to stress that in terms of data visualization I would not find it wise to penny-count the number of methods, I don' think there's many more important things in data analysis than to show how it reacts to the applied operations, so IMHO it would be saving 'at the wrong end'. Nevertheless, I believe @jorisvandenbossche 's comment of 6 added methods for this was more commenting on the lack of power that my PR adds compared to the linked PRs, and here I totally agree.\n\nSo, what is the status of the centrally truncated view (i.e. a 4-corner-view), when will it come or is it available in a branch/fork?\n\nIncidentally, I was wondering: Is it possible to automatically adapt the current automatic  number of displayed lines and columns as a percent value of the current notebook's width/length?\n"
