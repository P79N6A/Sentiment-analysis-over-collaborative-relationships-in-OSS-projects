    "body": "+1 for reconsidering the deprecation for Periods. \r\n\r\nThe behavior is unambiguous, simple and useful. Anecdotally speaking it’s used heavily at my organization, and is one of the reasons that people prefer working with periods.\r\n\r\nThat said I still think that the new behavior of period1 - period2 returning an offset object is good, and wouldn’t want to see that change."
