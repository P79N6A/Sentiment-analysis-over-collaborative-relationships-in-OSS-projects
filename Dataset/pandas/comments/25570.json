And the task should not be as difficult because all the information needed to reconstruct the DataFrame is contained in the string representation.  In fact to me it seems all that one needs to do is \r\n\r\n1. Compute the column widths by analyzing the header\r\n2. Extract columns corresponding to the data & the index seperately\r\n3. Refill missing entries in the index\r\n\r\nWhich is essentially what is proposed in this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/55024872/9318372\r\n"
