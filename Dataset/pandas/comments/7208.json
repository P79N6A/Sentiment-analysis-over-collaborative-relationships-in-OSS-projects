    "body": "Thank you, good to know about this!\nAfter some debugging I found the real issue of my performance drain. With .ix, I took a slice from a DataFrame and passed it along to another function. This function would update the slice. However the parent-dataframe was much bigger. Apparantly this slowed down the code tremendously. I now make a copy of the slice and update the parent later with the modified copy. In debugging I discovered that .ix also was somewhat slower, but as said this was not accounting for the full problem. Thank you for your help.\n"
