Eg:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    In [84]: pd.Index(['a', 'e', 'c']).intersection(['e', 'd', 'c']) \r\n    Out[84]: Index(['e', 'c'], dtype='object')\r\n    ```\r\n* `Index.union` typically sorted, but not in all cases:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    In [86]: pd.Index(['a', 'e', 'c']).union(['a', 'b'])\r\n    Out[86]: Index(['a', 'b', 'c', 'e'], dtype='object')\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n  A case where it does not sort: equal index objects:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    In [88]: pd.Index(['a', 'e', 'c']).union(pd.Index(['a', 'e', 'c']))\r\n    Out[88]: Index(['a', 'e', 'c'], dtype='object')\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn pandas 0.24.0, we added a `sort` keyword to most of the set-operation methods. First to `Index.difference` (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/22811), later also to `union` and `intersection` (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/24521).\r\n\r\nTo match the current behaviour, a default of `sort=True` was used for `union` and `difference`. @reidy-p is that the correct reason? Or were there other arguments? \r\n\r\nBut, for `Index.intersection`, a default of `sort=True` actually changed the behaviour, hence this issue.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo we had inconsistent behaviour between `intersection` and `union`/`difference`, and also within one method (sometimes it is not sorted, see example above). \r\nLong term, I think we would ideally get a consistent behaviour. The question is then what the default behaviour should be.\r\n\r\nI think there are several reasons for this to be `False`.Eg that is more consistent with what we did for eg `concat`?

IIUC the desired long-term behavior for Index.intersection is `sort=False`. If we release a 0.24.1 with `sort=False`, then we shouldn't need a deprecation cycle, since every version of pandas except 0.24.0 does the right thing.\r\n\r\nI didn't really appreciate the the subtleties of `Index.union(sort=True)` until now... I agree that passing `sort=True` should always result in a sorted index or error, but we also don't want to change behavior. Your suggestion of `sort=None` meaning \"legacy\" behavior (with all the complexities of maybe not sorting) is good.\r\n\r\n> errors if sort=True is passed but we can't or don't actually sort.\r\n\r\nI think that long-term, once the default for `Index.union` is `sort=False`, we can even sort identical objects (rather than raising an error).

    "body": "I'm a bit late coming back to this but want to say thanks to everyone for a very thoughtful discussion and for following up so quickly.\r\n\r\nJust to add some more context of where I was coming from. I was originally working on #22811 and found that to get ``groupby.nth`` to maintain column order I needed to be able to control the sort behaviour of ``Index.difference`` so I added a ``sort`` parameter to this method. After this was merged in I realised that the other set operations for ``Index`` did not have any ``sort`` parameters which is unfortunately a bit inconsistent. So I opened #24471 to propose adding ``sort`` parameters to the other set operations for ``Index``. This has been discussed in plenty of other issues that I reference in that issue but has never been implemented.\r\n\r\nMy plan was to implement the ``sort`` parameter for ``Index`` and other index types but I felt that it would be far too big to put in one PR so I planned to make several PRs and have a checklist in #24471 to make sure all the issues and corner-cases (such as equal indices) were covered. I agree with @shoyer that it's unfortunate that the parameter is pretty broken at the moment because I didn't get a chance to do as much work on it as I wanted before the release of 0.24.0 and I apologise for any inconvenience. I'd be happy to keep working on the sort parameter to make it work properly once we have any immediate issues with the legacy behaviour fixed."
