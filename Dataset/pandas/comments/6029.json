I'll try to find the other issue where I discovered this.\n"

    "body": "@cancan101, you are highly encouraged to go ahead and start such a project.\nIt probably won't become a new dependency but it will be a useful tool with it's own\nfocus that integrates well with pandas. we love those. \n\nI was going to +1 the timeout arg suggestion ([urllib2.urlopen](http://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.urlopen) supports a `timeout` argument btw) but \nafter a little more thought, I'm not so sure.\n\nFirst, some code:\n\n```\nimport requests\nr=requests.get('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Treme_episodes')\npd.read_html(r.content[0])\n```\n\nWorks just fine. Think about that. You can use your powerful tool of choice to handle network details\nand then hand pandas the data, Isn't that just perfect? Let's say timeouts seem like a reasonable thing\nto add (they kind of do). What about HTTP-basic auth? POST requests? custom HTTP headers?  \n`Requests` does a lot of things, should we expose them all through the method signature?\n\nIf the pandas plotting/mpl wrapper approach taught us anything is that you can end up in a bad\nway if you keep trying to expose more and more of the underlying functionality through your interface. (*)\n\nread_html is about parsing HTML into dataframes. It's not a Requests/urrllib wrapper, it's not a bs4 replacement.\nIf you need the power of requests, use it. pandas will cooperate. If you need the power of xpath\nexpressions, use those. pandas will accept the data you give it.\n\nThis is a bad pattern we seem to fall into time and time again. I suggest we start being really acerbic when \nconfronted with the syllogism: \"You rely on dep X. dep X can do Y. You should do Y\".\nI think the user should just \"Use X\" directly in many (not all. balance!) of those cases. \n\n(*) If you're a design patterns freak, this is [Facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern). Simplified is the whole point.\n"
