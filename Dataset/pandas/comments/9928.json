    "body": "A few thoughts. First, this is just as much if not more a scikit learn issue than a pandas issue -- last time I checked they didn't support dataframes as native input. Second, as a work around, try passing X.values and y.values -- that would help identify if this is really something related to pandas or not. If it does seem to be an issue that only appears when both pandas and scikit learn are combined, it would help if you could provide a full example that reproduces it, including input data. \n"
