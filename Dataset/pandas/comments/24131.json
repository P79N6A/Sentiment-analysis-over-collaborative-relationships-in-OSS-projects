    "body": "@mroeschke I agree that I was not expecting to have it min/max working on string. Since it was able to find min, I thought it was trivial to get the index and this is whay I was surprised. Anyway, on my side the right way is to use `datetime`. @WillAyd I don't understand what you want. I agree that I should use the right type. Since `min()` was working I was expecting `idxmin` to work. It is probably not that simple. Anyway if for everybody this is the expected feature, we can close my question."
