    "body": "so I looked into this and I think it's actually not a precision issue. It's because the function is not handling `pd.NaT` correctly. Please see https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/10072 \n\nBasically `values` are being forced into `float` and therefore `pd.NaT` becomes a non-null floating point number. `median()` therefore computes the median with that invalid value (that value happens to be a large negative number)\n"
