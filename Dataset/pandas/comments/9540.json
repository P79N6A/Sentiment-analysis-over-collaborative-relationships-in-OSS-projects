    "body": "Could you clarify a bit more what you are trying to achieve?\n\nThe `by` splits the original data into groups. df.hist() then calls the matplotlib histogram function for each group with the original weights. In your case the size of each by-group will be random and different. The weights however always are of length 100.\n\nThe by and weights combination seems to  work if the groups all have the same size and match the weights as in this example:\n\n``` python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nnp.random.seed(123)\n\nn = 100\ndf = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(n), columns=['a'])\n\nby = np.repeat([1,2,3,4,5], 20)\nweights = np.repeat(1/20., 20)\ndf.hist(by = by, weights = weights)\nplt.show()\n```\n"
