    "body": "@wesm Had a quick look at this.\n\nCurrently `DataFrame.to_string()` and `DataFrame.to_html()` have the same docstring (through Appender decorator), except for _bold_rows_. However `to_html()` misses _justify_ and _force_unicode_ arguments. It probably makes sense for html not to add the _force_unicode_ argument and always use unicode.\n\nBy the way _bold_rows=True_ also makes the column labels bold.\n"
