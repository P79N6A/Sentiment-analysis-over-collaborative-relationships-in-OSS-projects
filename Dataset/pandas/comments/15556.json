    "body": "(warning: long comment coming :-))\r\n\r\n> didn't see that there was a theme in a separate repo\r\n\r\nThat was also not yet advertised, so that is normal :-)\r\n\r\n> What about the general idea of home page I built [1]? I'm surely biased, but IMO makes it easier to find the different pages, compared to the options in the navigation bar in the pandas-dev bootstrap home [2].\r\n\r\nIt might serve a different purpose, eg the homepage of the documentation subsite vs the homepage of the general pandas site (which directly has links to subsets of the documentation in the top bar). \r\nAnd that's already one of the aspects to discuss to what extent we want to integrate both. \r\n\r\nPersonally I like having both a top navigation bar and side navigation bar, because the pandas documentation is so huge that it IMO would benefit from multiple layers of navigation (the current sidebar is way too long and does not give a good overview). If you are on a specific page (eg http://datapythonista.github.io/docs/new-pandas-doc/options.html in your example), the question is still how to navigate from there to another page. Of course answer can there be to go back to the home page, and make there a new choice. But I think we should think about how exactly we want to have the top and side bar to make this navigation easier. \r\nAnyway, both also don't exclude each other: you can have such a top bar but still have this overview page on the main doc landing page.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think there are several (of course intertwined) issues to tackle:\r\n\r\n\r\n**1. New sphinx theme**\r\n\r\nAs listed at the top of this issue: a new, fresh and mobile friendly sphinx theme. \r\nAnd for me, one of the important goals of such a new theme should be that it is more powerful to allow a more advanced structure / navigation than the current theme with the single flat list on the left side (which is the part where it overlaps with the other issues 2 and 3). \r\n\r\n* Do we write and maintain a custom one? (which can of course still largely be based on existing ones, like the bootstrap theme)\r\n* Or would we actually be happy to, for example, simply go with the readthedocs theme? Which can easily be given a 'personal' touch (like http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/docs.html or https://keras.io/)\r\n\r\n**2. Top-level reorganisation of the site / docs**\r\n\r\nPersonally I think the long flat list of pages in the current navigation makes it very hard to quickly find something in that list (related issue for this: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/6000). \r\nFor this aspect, I would go for some bigger \"sections\" like Getting Started, User Guide, Reference Guide, Community, Contributing, .. but that is of course completely up for discussion.\r\n\r\nWhen we would go for such a more hierarchical structure, then the theme needs to support this.\r\n\r\n* Do we only make such a subdivision for the documentation website (and think separately about re-working the main website), or do we integrate it at once with the main landing page?\r\n  * Dask (http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/) is an example with still a separate main landing page (although many of the top bar links point to doc subsections)\r\n  * If we choose a new theme with some visual identity for the docs, it would be nice to at least visually align the main landing page as well (but they of course still be separate structures).\r\n\r\n* How hierarchical do we want the structure to be? \r\n  * Going from a quick grouping the pages under headers in eg the readthedocs theme, with as example the headers in the dask (http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/docs.html#) or xarray (https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/)  sidebars\r\n  * to a very hierarchical example from the tensorflow docs (eg https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/datasets) with a two-level top bar, left side bar for different pages, and right sidebar for within page navigation\r\n  * or something in between :-)\r\n\r\nI see this issue nr 2 mainly as a reorganisation of the *existing* documentation pages, to get a relatively quick win in better navigation without rewriting the docs.\r\n\r\n**3. Restructuring individual documentation pages**\r\n\r\nPersonally I think some / many of our documentation pages are too long and not that beginner-friendly (many user guide pages are more reference guides). \r\nTo use the example of the \"Indexing and Selecting Data\" page (which goes up to code block nr 350), I can imagine a structure where the main landing page for this part of the documentation gives a more general overview of the concepts of indexing and selecting data in pandas, properly referring to then several more in depth pages on the several topics related to indexing (using loc/iloc, the index object, multi-index, query, ...)\r\n\r\nThe \"User Guide\" could then be divided in some of those big topics as IO, Indexing, Reshaping, Merging/concatenating, Visualization, Working with time data, Working with Categorical data, .. (which would be for the most  part a subset of the current pages), and the landing page for User Guide could give a nice overview of those topics.\r\n\r\nThis is however an even much bigger endeavour :-), so I would for now focus on the two issues above. But, in thinking about the navigation and the theme, it would be nice to at least have this use case in mind to make sure it would be possible.\r\n"

    "body": "Thanks a lot for organizing the discussion. I agree on everything you said.\r\n\r\nAbout 1) the sphinx theme, my experience with the sphinx bootstrap theme is really good. Opened couple of issues, and seems like many people is actively maintaining the project. I'm sure if pandas needs some customization, they'll be happy to help with that. So I don't see any reason to maintain a separate theme at this point.\r\n\r\nAbout 2) the site structure, I also think that having around 40 sections in the top level makes things very complicated to find. That was the discussion I wanted to have, on how I organized the different pages. I think the sections you propose are more or less the same than the ones I defined in my home, I guess that's the obvious division then. I also thought about whether it'd make sense to merge pandas.pydata.org with the documentation. I'm happy with both options.\r\n\r\nAbout 3) changing and splitting pages, I think it'll help a lot to have 2) completed to see things clearer. For example, if we manage to have a section \"Getting started\", it'll be much easier to think on how this section can be structured, if any page should be splitted... than with the current structure where everything is mixed.\r\n\r\nWhat would you think on the next roadmap:\r\na) decide which theme to use\r\nb) replace `nature` with the new theme in master\r\nc) discuss which main sections we want (`Getting started`, `Reference`...)\r\nd) discuss how the navigation of the page should be (sidebars, toctree depth, previous/next links...)\r\ne) replace the current home (index) with the new sections, and customize the theme with the desired navigation in master\r\nf) keep refining the pages (splitting, merging, avoiding duplications...)\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think it's better to keep changing master step by step, than have a branch or a separate project for the whole thing."

    "body": "I do agree with @datapythonista about using (and contributing to) the bootstrap sphinx theme as the theme for Pandas instead of a separate theme. I see benefits for using readthedocs as well (cfr. how dask does this), but the top bar of the bootstrap theme is something nice to have some main headers/topics. \r\n\r\nI do like the [general overview of pages](http://datapythonista.github.io/docs/new-pandas-doc/home.html), but on the other hand I would make it more 'welcoming' for newcomers and combine it with a proper side and header menu in order to support continued navigation (cfr. what joris mentioned on having to go back to the home page). \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/754862/41395080-b5f64d0a-6fac-11e8-83b2-b0884806f26b.png)\r\n\r\nI tried to make some 'mockup' like examples for a potential set of header items, which more ot less corresponds to the [main items of Marc's example](http://datapythonista.github.io/docs/new-pandas-doc/home.html). Not yet implemented, but to have a visual starting point for the discussion. Most of it I do think is achievable from within the bootstrap theme itself...\r\n\r\n1. An installation page with the pages relevant for installation:\r\n![mockup_install](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/754862/41395336-9a0d1212-6fad-11e8-90e1-add395aa712e.png)\r\n\r\n2. The user guide (cfr. contents); this is actually the largest set of pages, which would need further split up of individual pages, etc. \r\n\r\n![mockup_userguide](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/754862/41395457-11eeeabc-6fae-11e8-844d-aef69c3557ad.png)\r\n\r\n (an important item here is to lower the barrier to update te docs (just a direct link)\r\n\r\n3. API reference. Well, an API reference...\r\n\r\n![mockup_api](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/754862/41395535-5b4bbe42-6fae-11e8-897c-e7bda491897b.png)\r\n\r\n4.

I do think this is an important one and needs to be engaging. I like the example of vispy.\r\n\r\n![mockup_community](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/754862/41395592-95eeef74-6fae-11e8-819b-d3fe1a37364b.png)\r\n\r\n6.

I mean, we won't have a `pandas-sphinx-theme`, and we would just add `bootstrap-sphinx-theme` to the dependencies, if I understand it correctly.\r\n\r\nWhat would you think if we start by opening a PR to the `pandas` repo to replace `nature` by `bootstrap` with the minimum changes? Keeping the current structure, and without any additional menu or page.

    "body": "The reasons that I thought the separate repo was a good idea was for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- in the idea that in the end it might become a custom theme (or theme based on an existing one but with customizations). This I cannot really judge to what extent we will need to customize or not. \r\n  But note that we currently also have a custom theme (meaning, we have a `theme` directory in our docs that contains custom css and templates). It can still be an option to keep this in a separate repo even after the experimental phase, e.g. if we also use it for the pandas-website (although this might be more annoying than helpful in practice)\r\n- in the idea that it would generate some discussion and iteration, and to off-load some of that traffic from the main pandas repo (there are already too many issues and PRs to follow here, and this is not really pandas functionality-related)\r\n- It gives easier review of PRs because it is set up to provide a rendered version\r\n- It gives an easier way of experimenting / iterating because a PR can be merged before the theme is in a usable state.\r\n\r\nIt's true that if we already agree on a way forward, it makes the separate repo less pressing. But, personally I think we can still experiment there first. \r\nIMO we should not merge an initial version already in master (the \"replace nature by bootstrap with minimal changes\"), because this should not block a release (we don't know how long it will take to get something we are satisfied with) and I think we should directly have a good version (which doesn't mean it needs to be perfect!) when we use the new theme in a released version. \r\nThe organisation and the theme of the docs is also a form of user experience, people get used to navigate the docs. This is therefore not something we should change too often IMO.\r\n\r\n(if I am making things too complicated, please argue so :-) )\r\n"

Then we can see how much code our theme has, and whether it's better to keep it in a separate project. And we can see in which repo makes more sense \r\n to work on refining, splitting... the individual pages."

    "body": "@WillAyd (and others) to come back on https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/25614 (using the readthedocs theme for our docs).\r\n\r\nFirst, readthedocs ([`sphinx_rtd_theme`](https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme)) is a really nice documentation theme: it is much better than our current theme (looks better, better responsiveness, etc), it is well maintained, and it is used by other projects as well (so gives some familiarity to users). \r\nSo that are certainly important advantages for moving to the readthedocs theme.\r\n\r\nBut personally, I find the readthedocs theme mainly great for relatively simple documentation websites, where the single sidebar navigation (as we also have currently) is sufficient, but lacking for very complex documentation sites where you would like more \"levels\" of navigation (eg combine top navbar with sidebar). \r\nThat is one of the reasons we have been looking into eg a bootstrap based theme (by @stijnvanhoey and @datapythonista, see links above). Although there is some difficulty in getting sphinx' toctrees talk properly with more advanced theme navigation (see eg https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/23763 for Marc's experience).\r\n\r\nGiven this renewed activity on the theme (@WillAyd opening the PR), I wanted to do a final quick test on how feasible it would be to have a more advanced (in terms of navigation) theme based on bootstrap. Instead of basing it on https://github.com/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme (which doesn't yet support bootstrap 4, and also does not fully allow this multi-level navigation out of the box), I basically copied the templates and styling from the bootstrap docs (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) and did some sphinx hacks to get it working. \r\n\r\nThe result can be seen here: https://pandas-dev.github.io/pandas-sphinx-theme/pr-bootstrap-docs-theme/user_guide/text.html\r\n\r\nThis should give the \"idea\" of what I would like to see for the pandas docs, but some notes:\r\n\r\n- This is of course a straight copy of the styling of the bootstrap docs. We might want a different look (eg different colors), so don't look too much at that. Also, some sphinx specific constructs (eg the \"note\" or \"warning\" boxes) don't have yet custom styling (would need to copy some css from sphinx based projects for that)\r\n- The idea is that it would highlight in the left and right sidebar (and also top navbar) where you are. This highlighting is currently still missing (amongst other things because sphinx uses \"current\" and bootstrap \"active\")\r\n- The home page of the docs should of course be reworked to fit into this (and can use a rework anyhow :-))\r\n- The IPython blocks are not executed (so you only see the input, not the output), just to speedup testing. But noting in case you would wonder.\r\n\r\nBut it should give some idea of what is possible with a theme based on this. \r\nOf course, this is still more custom development (although based on an active developed framework, and we might be able to keep it close to their docs theme, to make it easier to port changes), and not simply using a existing theme (such as readthedocs). But personally, I think it can give a better documentation website for pandas.\r\n"

FWIW the RTD theme you have built is a little rougher for TOC navigation than what was shown in [#26514](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/25614) as you physically have to visit a topic on the left hand side to expand its navigation. Maybe worth trying out the conf settings in that PR to see if that improves (may apply to both themes)?"

That seems to be the case with eg the readthedocs docs as well https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor me, this also shows the problem I have with the combination of our docs and the readthedocs theme. Either you set the navigation_depth to 2, but then you don't have any navigation any more in our very long doc pages (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/25131), or either you set it to a larger depth, but then once you expand this in eg the IO user guide page, the left sidebar gets so long that you don't see a lot of the navigation any more and you need to scroll inside the navigation. By splitting the navigation in eg a top bar and a left side bar, you can try to prevent this to a certain extent.\r\n"

I don't think the effort to change to the RTD theme is much less than changing to the bootstrap theme (that based on the research of @stijnvanhoey and myself is the best option).\r\n\r\nA quick change will leave a lot of work pending, of course:\r\n- Better navigation\r\n- Customization of the theme (colors, logo...)\r\n- A good home page\r\n- Integrating the website (which with RTD doesn't seem reasonable)\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nBut from my experience, it makes much more sense to work on it step by step in small PRs, as we did for the structure. And in that way, I'd change to the bootstrap theme, which goes into the right direction.\r\n\r\nI think we don't have a release planned for some time now, right? If that's the case sounds like a good time to start the transition, and have something that looks more finished for the next release."
