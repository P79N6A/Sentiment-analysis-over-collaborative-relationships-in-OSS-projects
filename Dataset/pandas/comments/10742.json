    "body": "The problem is that such float values are not supported for all columns types, and not for all database flavors. In this regard, the approach with None is generic and works in all cases. \nFor now, we have followed the flavor-agnostic path in pandas, and delegating flavor-specific things to sqlalchemy. And I am not sure to what extent we want to deviate from this path.\n\nAnother issue is that the use of NaN in pandas is not only used as Not-a-Number (the actual meaning), but in practice also to represent a 'missing value', for which NULL (and thus None on the python side) is more suited I think.\n\nAnyway, if we would want to add this functionality, we will have to think about the API, as I wouldn't change the default.\n"
