    "body": "To comment on the #8350 tangential relation, one way to think of libdynd is as an experimental sandbox in which array programming ideas similar to numpy but without a strong backwards compatibility guarantee are being evolved. This means, proportional to development resources available, libdynd can quickly react to pandas' needs and implement changes. The flipside of this coin is that any library depending on libdynd also needs to keep track of changes there as it evolves to the various demands from different use cases and projects.\n\nWhat we have been doing with blaze is keeping the head of master of each working together, validating that they work together via travis-ci, and doing releases at roughly the same time.\n"
