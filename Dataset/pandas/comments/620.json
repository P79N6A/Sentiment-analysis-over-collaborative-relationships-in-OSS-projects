    "body": "from @gdraps in #746\n\n```\nHi Wes,\n\nFirst off, thanks for Pandas and your recent talk at the NYC Python meetup.  On the topic of filtering, I found that NumPy vector filters are awesome for numeric data, but I have found myself reaching for the following idioms when dealing with alpha-numeric columns:\n\n   df[df.method.contains('abc')]\n   df[df.method.startswith('ghi')]\n   df[df.method.endswith('xyz')]\n\nWould you consider the addition of these methods to the Series class, not only to complement the existing `isin()` method, but to bridge the gap with SQL libraries, such as SQLAlchemy (http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/expression_api.html#sqlalchemy.sql.operators.ColumnOperators), and improve expressiveness of string queries in Pandas?\n```\n"
