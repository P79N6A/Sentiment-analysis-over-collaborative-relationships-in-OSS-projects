    "body": "this is actually because of how xlsxwriter handles its workbook options, the constructor is literally [`Workbook(path, options)`](http://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/workbook.html#Workbook) where options is a dict, so the correct call signature would be:\n\n``` python\nwriter = pd.ExcelWriter(my_path, engine='xlsxwriter', options={'constant_memory': True})\n```\n\nPlease reopen if this still doesn't resolve your issue.\n"
