You will have to edit `validate_cum_func` and replace the two arguments with `*args` for this to work with older `numpy` versions.\n\nYou probably should also then do some pre-processing on `axis` and `skipna` to make sure that they aren't being given `numpy` parameters (which should then be validated while `axis` and `skipna` are given their default values).\n\nPlease look at `pandas/compat/numpy/function.py` and `pandas/util/validators.py` to see how the validation system works as well as examples.\n\n@Michael-E-Rose : Sorry if this is more complicated than you had expected!  You unfortunately walked into a compatibility minefield with these functions.  Let me know if you have any questions!\n"
