It's really label versus positional, and an integer could be both. \n2. We've seen a lot of use cases that calls for both label and positional indexing (such as \"the 5th element of column A\").\n3. IIRC, the behavior used to be that it would try to use an integer as a label-based index but fall back to positional indexing if the label didn't exist. But that was even worse :)\n"
