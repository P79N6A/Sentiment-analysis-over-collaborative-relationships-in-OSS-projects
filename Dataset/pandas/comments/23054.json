The data set I have to work with also had a few hand-entered \"No data\" values that I dropped by string type and replaced with np.nan before doing the datetime conversion, maybe that is related? I also included this aspect in my recreation attempt, but, it's not causing problems. Maybe there is some other small detail to this that I'm missing. \r\n\r\nJust attaching the cleaned dates as a new column and dropping the ugly one worked though, so at least I can push forward at work."
