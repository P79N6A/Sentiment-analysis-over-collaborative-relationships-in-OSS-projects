    "body": "I _guess_ there should be a link between the two following proposals I see in this issue, but I'm failing to grasp it.\r\n\r\n1) ``pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples([('a', 'b', 'c'), np.nan, ('d', '', '')])`` fails: I think that's perfectly fine. Or at least, I would not call it a bug. Sure, there is scope for an enhancement, but one that I do not feel very important, and that at the same time doesn't seem easy to implement/maintain.\r\nIncidentally, I think that #23558 should be fixed by just passing a tuple of ``NaN``s, and that ``pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples([('a', 'b', 'c'), (np.nan,), ('d', '', '')])`` _should have_ raised - but never mind because it is not harmful and changing it now might break code.\r\n\r\n2) \r\n> Aside from the inconvenience, it is also a real problem to set elements of an array (say if there are several NaNs) to tuples, because they almost always get interpreted as another axis/list-like and then give creative errors.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by \"an array\"? Creating a ``MultiIndex`` with tuple labels is easy:\r\n```\r\nIn [2]: pd.MultiIndex.from_tuples([('a', 'b', 'c'), ('d', (2, 3), '')])\r\nOut[2]: \r\nMultiIndex(levels=[['a', 'd'], [(2, 3), 'b'], ['', 'c']],\r\n           labels=[[0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 0]])\r\n```\r\nIn any case, I fail to see the link with point 1)."
