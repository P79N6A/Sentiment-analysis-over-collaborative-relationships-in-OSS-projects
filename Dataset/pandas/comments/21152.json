But in the end: in the past we made the *choice* to explicitly allow this for Series, and given the inconsistency with DatetimeIndex, for 0.23 we made the *choice* to change this behaviour. \r\n\r\nI am not fully sure this was the best choice (we could also have opted for changing the DatetimeIndex behaviour), but I don't really object the choice (since there is not really a good reason people would want to do this, if they can also use datetime).\r\n\r\n> I would add a 2a): *How* the change was made. Should we have done a deprecation cycle? (yes) And is it worth reinstating with a deprecation? (not sure).\r\n\r\nYep, I agree we should ideally have done this with a deprecation cycle. And I personally think it is still worth to do it for 0.23.1\r\n"

The general thrust of it is that `DatetimeIndex` ops should behave like vectorized versions of `Timestamp` ops.  `Timestamp` follows the convention set by `datetime` when it comes to comparisons with `date`.  The analogy I think of is `datetime:date :: Timestamp:Period[D]`"

(as that does not work on Timestamp, but does work for DatetimeIndex or Series). \r\nWhich doesn't mean this discrepancy is a problem. For me it is fine to not support datetime.date, but support strings (and maybe we should add it to Timestamp for consistency?). I just think users could not have guessed this that it was \"wrong\"."
