    "body": "Thanks for the feedback. The motivation for `df.asof` was largely that there already is a `series.asof`. But as @shoyer points out, there's really no reason this needs to be specialized to timestamps (any sortable index should work). \n\nMaking it a part of index functionality as @jreback suggests, seems a natural choice to make the behaviour available to both frame and series, and also to non timeseries indexes.\n\nThere's really only two fundamental cases: either skip missings everywhere `.reindex(method='ffill')`, or skip them no where (not currently available), the other options can be achieve by the latter and fillna.\n\nI'll take a stab at implementing a `method='asof'` for reindex to handle the latter case, and let's abandon this PR. Might also make sense to deprecate `series.asof` in favor of `series.reindex(method='ffill')`. I'll confirm that it passes the tests for asof and open a seperate issue.\n"

    "body": "@shoyer Ah, well I feel quite the idiot right now. For some reason I was under the impression that `.reindex(where, model='ffill')` is ignored rows with missing values when it tries to find what to pull forward. Demonstrably however, this is not so:\n\n```\nprint(df)\n            a   b\n2008-01-02  1   1\n2008-01-09  2 NaN\n2008-01-16  3   3\n\nprint(df.reindex(new_dates, method='ffill'))\n             a   b\n2008-01-01 NaN NaN\n2008-01-08   1   1\n2008-01-15   2 NaN\n2008-01-22   3   3\n```\n\nI was expecting that bottom right `NaN` to be a `1` - I must have somehow conflated `method='ffill'` in `reindex` and `fillna`. \n\nSo since all the `df.asof` varieties can be achieved using the existing `.reindex(where='ffill')` approach, all this PR does is avoid an intermediate frame, but that's probably not worth cluttering the API for.\n\nSorry for the cycles wasted on my poor understanding.\n"
