You used that deferred object as if it were a {klass} - this materializes the deferred object by taking the mean() of each date group, which is deprecated behavior.  Update your code <...>\n\nWhat I was actually trying to do is take the month over month percent change - which is what `.last().pct_change()` does.  But I forgot the `last`, so it took the mean of month, then the `pct_change` of those means.\n"

It IS correct actually. I think the warning _could_ also include the deferred op reference (e.g. `pct_change()`) I suppose, BUT the warning actually comes out before.\n\nYou might have a look at `Resampler.plot()`.\n"
