For example, some formatting choices yapf makes are not very nice looking and I have manually fixed them.  However, if yapf is subsequently run on these files, that bad formatting will be returned. There is a way to disable yapf from formatting sections of code, but I'm not too happy about having to go back and add this.  Perhaps this can be considered a one-time process and understood flake8 will catch subsequent issues?  In order to make yapf work the way we want, changes will need to be made to it.\n"
