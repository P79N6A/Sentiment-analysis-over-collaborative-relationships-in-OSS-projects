String aliases should be coerced as appropriate (be it via setting or a asfreq method).\r\n> This should raise with a similar message as the constructor (be it via setting or a asfreq method).\r\n\r\n+1\r\n\r\nRegarding adding a `asfreq` to DatetimeIndex, or improving the setting via `freq`: such a potential `DatetimeIndex.asfreq` is somewhat different as `PeriodIndex.asfreq`. For periods it really converts the underlying integer values, while for datetimes, it is just setting an attribute (and checking the passed freq matches the values). \r\nTherefore, I would rather go improving `dti.freq = ...` to parse the passed string and raise a informative error message if needed (when the freq does not match the data).\r\n"

As @jorisvandenbossche  pointed out, the behavior of a potential `asfreq` on `DatetimeIndex` and `TimedeltaIndex`  would be a bit different than `PeriodIndex`.  Not sure how the potential for confusion between methods balances out with the API bloat of adding a new method though."
