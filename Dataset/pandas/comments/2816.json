    "body": "The bugs I fixed had to do with using the color keyword. @lesteve the bug is a result of the fact that LinePlot always ends up assigning a color from a default or custom color cycle so when you plot consecutive Series it always uses the same color. The right thing to do is just to have it omit the color specification if unspecified and matplotlib will automatically choose a different color. Look forward to a PR!\n"
