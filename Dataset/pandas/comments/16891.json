    "body": "CSV is not  a high fidelity format. It cannot represent schema, rather it must be inferred.\r\n\r\nFurther storing list-likes in cells is quite inefficient and non-idiomatic.\r\n\r\nYou are fighting a losing battle here. You are better off exploding the columns, possibly with a multi-level column index, and/or representing this an nd data."
