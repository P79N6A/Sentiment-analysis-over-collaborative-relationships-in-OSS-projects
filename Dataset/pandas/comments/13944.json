    "body": "Thanks for putting this together!\n\nA topic that is somewhat orthogonal to the internals, but one thing I've been thinking about in the context of pandas 2.0, is interaction with JIT compilers - mostly for UDFs.  I'm using `numba` as a frame of reference, but thinking generally.\n\nI came to pandas from SAS - there is _plenty_ to dislike about it - but one thing I actually do miss is a feeling of safety, that if you can write it, it will basically be fast.  Of course with pandas/numpy you have to be much more defensive, and sometimes try really hard to vectorize - just as an example I remember, this [SO answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/32524908/3657742) from @unutbu is really clever, but I would have never come up with it.\n\nI think this need to be vectorized adds to the pandas api  size, and I also think adds significantly to the learning curve.  I'm sure like many others, I've taken a hard look at Julia - it wasn't there yet (and maybe it won't ever be?) but there is a big allure to that model.  As a user, I'd love to be able to just write this, and just have it be fast.\n\n``` python\ndf.groupby('key').transform(lambda x: (x - x.mean()) / x.std())\n```\n\nThis may be more of a stretch, but as a contributor who's not a C++ wizard, it would also be nice if some portion of pandas was implementable at a JIT-able level, ala @shoyer's [numbagg](https://github.com/shoyer/numbagg).  I get this may not possible - you probably couldn't even make `numba` a required dep.\n\nSo I was just curious if you had any thoughts / roadmap ideas for this topic?  A C/C++ API would open the door a lot of the way, but I think there may be value in tighter integration?\n"

    "body": "One thing that surfaced recently in #13395 that I would like consider for pandas 2.0 is to expose the contiguous one dimensional arrays that store the values of DataFrame colums as part of the public API. These would be similar to the existing `Categorical` type, but done in more systematic manner and returned by pandas objects when you call `Series.values` and `Series.unique()`.\n\nThis would be complementary to existing scalar types like `Period`/`Datetime`/`Timestamp`. If the existing scalar type has the name `pandas.Scalar`, I would call the array version `pandas.ScalarArray`, inheriting from `pandas.BaseArray`.\n\nHaving such an API would be useful for third party libraries that integrate with pandas in a deep way (such as seaborn, sklearn, statsmodels and xarray), because it doesn't always make sense to work with labeled values.\n"

I'll indicate in the document pages that are Internals related and those that are separate from Internals and maybe we can make more PRs digging into some of the other refactoring / cleanup we want to do. \n\nLet's start discussing on the mailing list how we intend to proceed with two branches of pandas? I would suggest we should keep the pandas 2.0 branch \"rebaseable\" for as long as possible, but at some point there will be some necessary divergence. \n"
