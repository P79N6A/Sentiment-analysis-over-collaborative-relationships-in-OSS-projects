It just seems that if DataFrame.apply is called on an empty DataFrame and the lambda returns a Series when given an empty Series, the result should be an empty DataFrame.  If the lambda returns a scalar, it would make sense the result is an empty Series.  Unless I misunderstand apply.\n\nI know this is a pretty degenerate case... and we could work around it - but thanks for thinking about it!\n"
