    "body": "At first glance, it appears that the test started failing 3 days ago. The test was written based on the assumption that BigQuery's streaming system caches the table schema for up to 2 minutes. This is mentioned in the following stackoverflow post.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/25279116/cannot-insert-new-value-to-bigquery-table-after-updating-with-new-column-using-s\n\nThis assumption is documented in `gbq.py`.\nhttps://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/7d40f18718ba80e8b8d706eaed2fc4c098686e71/pandas/io/gbq.py#L569\n\nIt appears that this assumption is no longer valid.  Another user mentioned a similar issue in [Google BigQuery Issue 191](https://code.google.com/p/google-bigquery/issues/detail?id=191):\n\n> Our team has noticed that updates are taking over 2 minutes now (more like ~10 minutes) as of the past 12 hours.\n\n`pandas.io.gbq.to_gbq()` will also fail for end users under the following condition:\n- Users set the `if_exists` parameter of `pandas.io.gbq.to_gbq()` to `'replace'`\n- The schema differs from the remote BigQuery schema\n- The BigQuery system cache is greater than 2 minutes (i.e. change in schema is not reflected in BigQuery). \n\n```\n    if_exists : {'fail', 'replace', 'append'}, default 'fail'\n        'fail': If table exists, do nothing.\n        'replace': If table exists, drop it, recreate it, and insert data.\n        'append': If table exists, insert data. Create if does not exist.\n```\n"
