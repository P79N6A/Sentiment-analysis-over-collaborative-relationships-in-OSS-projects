    "body": "@trottier the bundled ujson is a custom modified fork to add built-in support for encoding and decoding pandas objects at the C-level (better performance), so it's not a simple drop-in. IIRC standard ujson is also significantly faster than simplejson.\n\nThat said though I do wonder if this could be fixed. It seems to handle very large numbers pretty well, and a very brief look at the code suggests it just reverts to `sprintf` if the value is above a threshold, I wonder if something similar could be done for very small values. I'm not in a position to play with this now but I'll have a deeper look when I get some time.\n"

    "body": "@trottier: I assume the actual problem is that you want to be able to dump data from pandas to json and then read it back again, and got bitten because the json routines throw away precision? That's pretty nasty.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you add extra decimal points; IEEE doubles always have the same amount of precision in them. The important thing is that for any (finite) float value, you get bit-accurate round-tripping. The usual rule is to print as many decimals as are necessary to accomplish this, but if you have extra that's okay too.\n\nThat said, double printing/reading is _extremely hard_, and from a quick skim I wouldn't trust ujson to do it at all. Obviously there's the nasty stuff where it just throws away precision by default, but even if you use a very high `double_precision` value, I wouldn't be surprised if it still blew up on e.g. denormalized numbers. And I bet it makes rounding errors in some cases; you can't print by just dividing by ten and ignoring rounding error and get accurate results. And even with the new `precise_float` option for decoding, I bet it completely blows up if it's in a non-C locale. (`strtod` can not, in general, read JSON-formatted floats; it might expect a `,` as decimal separator etc.)\n\nPython ships with high-quality double<->string conversion routines based on those in netlib -- `PyOS_string_to_double`, `PyOS_double_to_string` (or `PyOS_ascii_strtod`, `PyOS_ascii_formatd` in pre-2.7 versions).\n\nIt's _possible_ that using these routines would produce some measurable slowdown... the string_to_double routine in particular has some mallocs, returns a newly-malloc'd pointer that you have to free, instead of writing into an existing buffer. But it'd be pretty easy for someone to patch ujson to use them and then run a benchmark to see whether they're actually slower. (And a 10% slowdown or whatever would be a pretty reasonable trade-off for, like, getting correct results, anyway...)\n\nImplementation is here if anyone's curious about what's involved in doing this right: http://hg.python.org/cpython/file/44f455e6163d/Python/dtoa.c\n"

Ujson doesn't use the word \"precision\" properly, so if you try to represent 1.2345678901234567e-1 you'll lose one decimal place of precision, e-2 and you'll lose two, etc.\n\n```\nujson.dumps(1.23456789123456e-5, double_precision=100)\n==> '0.000012345678912'\n\nujson.dumps(1.23456789123456e-6, double_precision=100)\n==> '0.000001234567891'\n```\n"

It might be worth investigating the optional use of `PyOS_string_to_double` etc in future though if you think it will provide exact round-trip precision.\n"
