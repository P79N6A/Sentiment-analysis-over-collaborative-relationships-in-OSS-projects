I've been able to install 0.21 and 0.22 to previous Python 3.4 interpreters and the fix you linked looks like it's scheduled for 0.23 and shouldn't be in the releases. I mean if `pandas` hasn't officially supported 3.4 since 0.21, then I guess it doesn't really matter that this has broke, though it might be a symptom of another problem."
