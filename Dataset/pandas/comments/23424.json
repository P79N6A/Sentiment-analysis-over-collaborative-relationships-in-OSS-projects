While I could use `sudo xcode-select -s <path>` to switch between the 2 versions, and `clang --version` confirmed it was switching the compiler version at least, I am suspicious that the libstdc++ libs and headers from 9.4.1 have been left somewhere thats not affected by the switch.  So there may be some scenarios where this breaks (eg fresh install of Mojave).\r\n\r\nI'll continue to investigate, if thats OK"

    "body": "hi @WillAyd the behaviour seems to depend if clang is able to find stdlibc++ headers/libs. This depends on the xcode install history, hence the difficulty in reproducing this.\r\n\r\ni suppose there are 2 options: (1) require the user to workaround this by installing stdlibc++ or (2) change mac os targets to build + link libc++. \r\n\r\nSo far i am unable to get (1) working again on my system. I've tried:\r\n- `xcode-select--install`, this responds with `xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use \"Software Update\" to install updates`.\r\n- installing `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg` as per @JustinZhengBC \r\n\r\nBut after each step I get the original compile error I reported. \r\n\r\nfor option 2 i've created a PR. I didn't meant to preempt any decision on taking this - its my first PR and i didnt realise that pushing a branch to my fork would update the GH issue. CI is running now with travis, azure (passed), circle ci, appveyor (passed)\r\n\r\nplease let me know how you'd like to proceed"

    "body": "Hi, I got to the bottom of this issue, in the end, after a trawl through clang, distutils and python make/config files.\r\n\r\nThe compiler standard library defaults to either `libstdc++` or `libc++`, depending on the targetted macOS version - `libstdc++` for 10.8 and below, and `libc++` for 10.9 and above. This is determined by the environment variable `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` or the compiler option`-mmacosx-version-min`, defaulting to the system version otherwise. \r\n\r\nWhen `distuils` builds extensions on macOS, it sets`MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to the version that python was compiled with, even if the host system / Xcode is newer.  \r\n\r\nRecent macOS versions of python have a 64-bit only variant built for 10.9 (python.org), and a universal 64/32-bit variant built for 10.6 (python.org) or 10.7 (conda). I am running the conda universal variant, so `distutils` targets macOS 10.7, despite my system being 10.14, with Xcode 10 which doesn't install `libstdc++`. Hence the failure I saw.\r\n\r\nIt may work for some users, for 1 of 2 reasons:\r\n- `libstdc++` is lying around somewhere from a previous Xcode 9 install\r\n- when running a recent 64-bit only variant of python, which targets macOS 10.9 and hence `libc++`\r\n\r\nI've pushed a revised change which sets the targeted macOS to 10.9, when running on a 10.9 or above system, with a python/distutils which targets pre-10.9. This should not break builds on pre-10.9 systems, unlike my previous approach. It fixes the issue on my system.  CI is running now. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to submit it as a PR (assuming CI passes)"
