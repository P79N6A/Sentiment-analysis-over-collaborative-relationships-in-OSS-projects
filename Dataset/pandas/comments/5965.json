    "body": "Thanks for reporting this, it has already been fixed (#5844) and will be part of the \nnext 0.13.1 release. I've uploaded a corrected tarball to github releases, so you can immediately:\n\n`pip install https://github.com/pydata/pandas/releases/download/v0.13.0/pandas-0.13.0.tar.gz`\n\nI'll send the word out to get the fixed version uploaded to pypi as well, that might\ntake a few days though.\n\nIn the future, it would be a great help if you pitch in and test the RC release when we\nannounce it and help us catch these problems earlier. Thanks.\n"
