    "body": "Thanks for the report, this is a duplicate of #11733, definitely would like to solve this.  \r\n\r\n`index_col=None`, contrary to what you could might expect, is treated as \"infer whether or not there is an index column\" and is also the default for `read_excel`.   So as mentioned in that issue, I think the right approach is change the default for `index_col` to a sentinel (e.g. `'infer'`) so that `index_col=None` can mean something.  PRs / ideas for the api welcome!\r\n"
