    "body": "I'm not familiar with Python 3, but I know there's a conversion tool, so maybe I can try that when I get a chance.\r\n\r\nI can report that I got rid of most (maybe all?) of the problems by changing two arguments in _read_csv_:  I set \"na_values\" to \"''\" and \"keep_default_na\" to _False_.  Apparently one factor leading to the issues in this particular case was that the \"na\" settings in _read_csv_ affect not only the values in a csv but also the index/column labels.  When doing natural language processing and using tokens (words) as DataFrame and Series labels, it's pretty much inevitable that the default null values will come up, unless you explicitly exclude them from your vocabulary (and there are good reasons not do do so).  The current behavior of _read_csv_ is not nonsensical, but it could be better documented, and I think there's a good case for having different args for the labels and the values."
