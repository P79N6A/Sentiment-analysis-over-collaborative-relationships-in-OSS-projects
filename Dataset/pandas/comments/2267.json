However, now that I go back to the Pandas documentation, I see on the front page:\n\n> Here is a basic tenet to keep in mind: data alignment is intrinsic. The link between labels and data will not be broken unless done so explicitly by you.\n\nSo, this behavior makes sense now---I just needed to hit myself over the head with a concrete example of what that statement meant.\n"
