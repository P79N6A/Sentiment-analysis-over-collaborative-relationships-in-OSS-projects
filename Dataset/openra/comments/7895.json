    "body": "So I've started looking into this. The current issue is that refreshing the server list is very much a gui thing. Clicking refresh currently does a server list download, and upon completion of said download, proceeds to clear the entire list box out and re-load it from scratch.\n\nIn order to know that a new game has been added, we must, at the very least, cache the host:port of each game as a list, and upon server update, check this previous list to see if any NEW host:port items exist.\n\nThis adds a secondary problem. If we simply bolt this on as an automagic timer, this will cause the UI to constantly scroll back to the top; OR it does NOT update the UI, and most likely confuse someone when they look and don't see a change (because they still have to click refresh).\n\nSo what we could do is, instead of clearing out the entire list and re-building it from scratch, we do more of a merge operation that updates the existing list by adding/removing/updating items as needed.\n\nWould this freak out the ScrollPanelWidget? I guess if it does we could also fix it in the same patch, assuming it isn't a major issue.\n\nEither way, I'd like to hear what the consensus is before I put any effort towards this item.\n"
