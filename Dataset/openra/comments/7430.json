    "body": "@RoosterDragon I've made a new push which pushes even further the pathfinder. According to my tests, not only I've achieved performance boosts of +80-90% over the old pathfinder, but the current pathfinder now can GUARANTEE that the shortest path is given (previously it wasn't guaranteed, given the treatment that was done on closed/seen nodes). To achieve this, I applied several tactics over the priorityqueue and a comparer with the CellLayer array for realtime comparisons.\n\nNow, there is lot of room for caching results and even develop a hierarchical pathfinding solution which would dramatically boost the pathfinder performance.\n\nI would wish, if you are so kind, to provide me with feedback of your profilings with this new version and your comments on the code.\n"

I've played a 6v6 game (11 bots and 1 human player) on a big map for 15 minutes.\n\nShowing the function \"EvalPath\" that processes the path for a unit. Note the improvement inside the FindBidiPath function.\n\nThis profiling has proven to me that the current cache is quite useless. A better approach (under study) would be to pre-generate at map loading time a Shortest Path Tree for different unit classes and paths so every path from one point to another is covered and precalculated.\n\nAnother thing to consider is to integrate a hierarchical pathfinder approach to dramatically boost performance.\n\nBleed:\n![bleed profile](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5826108/6204089/f86d661e-b53d-11e4-9fd9-baa798055055.jpg)\n\nThis PR: \n![pr profile](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5826108/6204091/febfdc18-b53d-11e4-8a72-c1a621412702.jpg)\n"
