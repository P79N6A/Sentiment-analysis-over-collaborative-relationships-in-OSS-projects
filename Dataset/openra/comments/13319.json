    "body": "I'm not a fan of having this work only when the player clicks the quit button, but not when they leave by any other means (e.g. closing the game through their window manager or losing network connection).  Better to have a feature not implemented at all than to have it work sporadically.\r\n\r\nYou can make this work on disconnect by having the server synthesise the surrender order when it drops the client.  Look at the Server.cs changes in #10787, but please also read the context around that PR and linked issues to understand the complications related to the (maybe fixed, maybe not) desyncs."

    "body": "Agreed, though Surrender and Leave are the only 2 ways to leave the match without closing the game. Now they behave differently what is also not ideal. Often players don't realize this difference, they simply leave as they know they lost to play another match, so it could improve the situation overall.\r\nI'll look at that PR."
