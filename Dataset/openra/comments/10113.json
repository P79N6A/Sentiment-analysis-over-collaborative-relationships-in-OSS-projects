    "body": "The most annoying part is when you order your units to attack enemy units and the engineer runs up next to them. Maybe this would be alright for RA since the engineer doesn't capture instantly. This might be annoying for TD if you want some engineers in your army to capture husks and enemy buildings. If you rushed an engi+apc you would have to singularly click all the units to capture since using box select would prioritize the apc.  I like the current system because using control groups is adequate to control them in my opinion but it is annoying when they sprint up to the enemy\n"

The proper solution (and I think the original RA did this) is to not have the engineers move when given an attack order. You have a group huddled together and you give an attack order. Those that can attack go running after the target. Those that can't remain idle. \n"
