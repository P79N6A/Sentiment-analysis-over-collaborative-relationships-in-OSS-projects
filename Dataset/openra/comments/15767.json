As a result, support units were out of this. I don't mind adding them, but then should transport units be in as well? What about the engie? I have no definite opinion on the matter, but a consensus on where to draw the line needs to be made. What I don't want though, is to have the harvesters counted in."

By precaution, I'd say count it in ?\r\n\r\nI don't know, again it's all about where you draw the line: look at engie for instance, you could argue that they do affect the enemy player if used as a mean to capture their building. Chinooks never do any damage, but they do if they crash, so should they be counted in? Even harvesters could be counted in since they can be used to tank and crush infantry. \r\n\r\nSo yeah again, the current patchset is where *I* drew the line, but obviously don't mind adjusting it to a certain extent (see remark on the harvs in my previous post) in one direction or another. That said, since the issue is debatable in many aspects, I'd prefer if a definite consensus was decided before I make any change."

Doing so makes the diffs much smallers.\r\n- rebased on `bleed`\r\n\r\nNote: I haven't retested all the mods again, so please double checks if more units need exceptions."
