    "body": "# Issue\r\nWhen a player attempts to capture someones Construction Yard the engineer(s) could disappear without capturing the building if the opposing player un-deploys the building to an MVC as the unit(s) are entering.\r\n\r\n# Reproduction\r\nI was able to reproduce this issue on `release-20161019` and `bleed` as of 01/18/17 1:00 AM CST (replays below)\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n\r\n1. Start 2 clients and put them in the same multiplayer game.\r\n2. Build multiple engineers on player 1 and get them near player 2's base\r\n3. Order player 1 engineers to capture player 2's construction yard (from a bit of a distance)\r\n4. Switch to player 2 and have construction yard selected and ready to un-deploy\r\n5. Un-deploy to MVC just as player 1 engineers reach the edge of the building (see image for reference)\r\n6. Engineers will disappear but the MVC will stay in player 2's control\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n\r\n![00](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12243529/22054733/c658f8ba-dd1c-11e6-8672-4268d1458b03.png)\r\n[Map in video](http://resource.openra.net/maps/13528/)\r\n\r\n### Replay Files\r\n[Issue in video](https://mega.nz/#!Zs8HDZrQ!s6cpa3yQCttISRRt8GOEzsijGy6HK0a0qcX58fJGv78)\r\n[Reproduction on release branch](https://mega.nz/#!xolUmLpb!aYJ2OaVjDggmCzjsmfras5PjGYPl9MGlNIdRGXYyCJU) (starts about 9 min in)\r\n[Reproduction on bleed branch](https://mega.nz/#!8pVn2DCb!PG_cGZhU_ZmeKQtdYZw0dOAKKCTaIvY_w_WPoWAGywQ) (last commit [`59619a4e0d4c3eec1dd0d1841d627ad7689d2f5c`](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/commit/59619a4e0d4c3eec1dd0d1841d627ad7689d2f5c))\r\n\r\n"
