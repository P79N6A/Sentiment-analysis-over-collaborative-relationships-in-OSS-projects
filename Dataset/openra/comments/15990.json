    "body": "Most people will have to use both hands to hit these keys. If we look back at the original issue, time and control have been the main factors that motivated the author to ask for this feature. In his opinion, re-assigning the control-group would create a greater \"mess\" than removing certain units from a control-group. I know that these settings could be changed to a more ergonomic setup by the player, however these defaults alone make me doubt if there is any additional value in this change.\r\n\r\nThe author raised another point that is more interesting IMO: Removing units from control-groups when they are sent to repair. It is the underlying problem this feature request tries to address. You have to remove those units from a control group, that you want to send to repair. Otherwise any order given to the control-group will \"overwrite\" the repair order.\r\n\r\nIMO, there is no problem with assigning control-groups (which includes the removal of units from control-groups). However - and this would need to be discussed separately - I would support a change that removes units (temporarily?) from control groups, when they are send to repair.\r\n\r\nMustaphaTR is right that a unit can only be in one control group. This means that you already have a very fast and more comfortable solution to remove single units from conrol-groups by assigning a \"dummy\" control-group to them. In the light of this, I don't see additional value in this change that justifies the costs pchote already mentioned.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "@pchote Those are all valid points and things that I've been thinking about as well. I agree we need more opinions here. Here's my opinion:\r\n\r\n**Overhead for players**\r\nI think this is not a big problem as players don't bother remembering all of the hotkeys but only the ones that they find useful. For example there a lot of keys that I don't use - viewport bookmarks, production facilities cycle and player stance toggle (I wish there was a way to unbind them but that's another issue). \r\n\r\nAny piece of software with a complex UI will probably have a lot of hotkeys (think of photo editing suites, softrawe IDEs, etc.) and novice users will perform most tasks first with the mouse, gradually learning the hotkeys and deciding which ones make sense to their workflow (playstyle).\r\n\r\n**Maintenance cost**\r\nThis is a fairly simple hotkey.\r\n\r\n**The need for this hotkey**\r\nThis is the most important part of the question... The most common use-case is for units that are ordered to repair. Other use-cases will depend on player style - a few from my experience: splitting a small part of a grouped army, managing air units (I tend to use 2-3 control groups for aircraft). \r\n\r\nPerhaps this is not sufficient to justify the existence of such a hotkey. And as mentioned there is a work-around (adding to a dummy group) but to me that feels awkward."
