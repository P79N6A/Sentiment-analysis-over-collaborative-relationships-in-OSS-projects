That is silly.\n\nI personally think we should instead remove the disable bots server command - this is a legacy hack added back in the days before RA had a skirmish option, specifically to prevent people from hogging the (only) two or three dedicated servers with 1vbot games.  There is no reason to keep it in modern versions of OpenRA.\n"
