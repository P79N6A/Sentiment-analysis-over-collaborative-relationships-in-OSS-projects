    "body": "Hi,\n\nI am relatively new to Lua scripting used in OpenRA, but I have been experimenting pieces of it to build a working AI that can provide a good degree of intelligence, or even **mimic player behavior**.\n\nSome of my works are here. (Pardon me if you see code from elsewhere, especially missions)\nhttp://resource.openra.net/maps/14893/\nhttp://resource.openra.net/maps/15020/\n\nMy _ultimate_ goal is to build a set of Lua scripts that can perform the following tasks.\n**Already existent**\n- A1. Given building types and locations, perform base building.\n- A2. Given factory types and a list of actors, perform unit production.\n- A3. Holding lists for units - this can be used to transfer units to various sub-lists (a.k.a. teamtypes) for little tasks.\n- A4. Stance changing (\"no way I will continue to defend/hold if a V2RL keeps shooting me!\")\n- A5. Given waypoints, somewhat-working Allied and Soviet aircraft movements.\n\n**Probably possible to build/refine.**\nEconomy\n- B1a. Given cost and buildtime, trickle expenses (like how it is done for the player) every _n_ ticks.\n- B1b. Given cost and buildtime, maintain a \"progress\" counter for each factory/production queue. (place on map/activate at 100%)\n- B1c. If AI money is insufficient, put trickle expenses and \"progress\" counter on hold.\n- B1d. Provide refunds and related customer service for AI.\n- B1e. Player engineers can disrupt AI production, OpenRA style.\n\nTeamtype and Actor behavior\n- B2a. Extend _A3_ to include a sub-list for base defense.\n- B2b. Extend _A3_ to include sub-lists for ore miner defense, that can be cleared when there are no threats.\n- B2c. Offensive sub-lists to keep track of kills / losses / actor health.\n- B2d. If losses are sustained, attacking sub-list to regroup and reinforce from holding list.\n- B2e. Make a sub-list for repairing units.\n- B2f. Extend _B2e_ to include heal/repair by medic/mechanic. \n- B2g. Extend _B2c_ + _B2d_ + location of enemy attacker to produce \"formations\". (lol micro)\n\nActor scripts\n- B3a. Scripts: Attack infantry-only / Attack tanks-only / Attack structures-only (may be currently possible using rules.yaml, weapons.yaml and Lua scripts, \"e7.noattacktanks\")\n- B3b. Dogs with a greater carnal desire to pursue thy enemy.\n\nBase building enhancements\n- B4a. AI to prioritize certain buildings (power/factory/refinery) in base building\n- B4b. Given _B4a_, AI can note all its pre-placed buildings (with allowance for exceptions) and append them in its base building list.\n- B4c. AI to prioritize buildings closer to base? Mostly aesthetic, but with _B4c_ this can be helpful.\n\n**Probably not possible given the limited scope of Lua functions, yet**\n**Require access to CanPowerDown or related controls**\n- C1. AI to toggle power off when on low power (a hacky method exists: transfer ownership)\n- C2. AI to toggle power on when on sufficient power.\n- C3. AI to keep track of max power expenditure vs actual power usage, to help prioritize power plants.\n- C4. AI to 'divert' power between base defenses based on surrounding threat.\n\n**Require access to the terrain and overlay layers** \n- D1. AI to _choose_ building placement locations, obeying terrain limits and base adjacency.\n- D2. AI to _choose_ its own attack waypoints based on terrain and enemy attack patterns\n- D3. AI to scan for ore to prioritize refinery placements\n- D4. Extend _D2_ + _D3_ for MCV expansion.\n- D5. Factor base expansions into _D1_.\n- D6. Extend _D4_ for other expansion styles (AI base push?)\n- D7. Extend _D2_ for learning AI. (??!)\n\nProbably should end my little rant somewhere.\nIf successful (a big _if_), this could be a quick fix for #10589.\nI suspect that Lua functionality may need to be expanded to tackle some of the more interesting points.\n"
