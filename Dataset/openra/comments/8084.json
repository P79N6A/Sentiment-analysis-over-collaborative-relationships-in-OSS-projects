    "body": "The code looks good, and it seems to work ingame, but creates an issue that needs to be addressed - migs and yaks start turning back toward their target too late. They lose the target the moment they start turning, so you need to tell them to attack after each pass.\nIf they just turn earlier, this can be avoided.\nOr maybe if you queue the Move activity to the last known location, but then check if the old target is visible and attack it (that might be problematic due to the airplane's movement style though).\n\nP.S.: Also please rebase.\n"
