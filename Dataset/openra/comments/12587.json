    "body": "> Modern games and operating systems tend to be 64-bit only these days.\r\n\r\nThere you have the first problem. Especially true with lots of indie game titles these days that I have to skip due to the fact that although I would def. be able to handle them, they tend to be more and more 64-bit only. Which makes me sad, considering that the 32-bit machine I am sitting in front of would easily be able to handle these games in the years to come.\r\n\r\n> I haven't checked how many players are still running 32-bit operating systems.\r\n\r\nAlthough I do not know the data and also would like to see it I think you would be heavily surprised as to how many players are not only playing ORA for the retro aspects, but also due to the fact that they cannot handle much more elaborate engines in terms of processing power and graphic hogging. The recent dropping of XP has stirred up a bee hive. I fear switching to 64-bit only would do the same for the wasp nest next door.\r\n\r\n> 32-bit only era hardware will also make playing OpenRA especially the upcoming TS/RA2 mods not much fun anyway.\r\n\r\nI beg to differ with the same reason as on the top. The architecture - while of course setting the limits for certain hardware does not necessarily show you the \"beefiness\" of such systems. That being said when it comes to heavily modified gen2-mods like CD and SP or AS, I have no problem running them on my 32-bit machine in terms of performance. And the limiting factors there - if any lag would take hold - is definitely not the 32-bit barrier. \r\n\r\n> Hopefully no one will be excluded.\r\n\r\nTotally unimportant side note: You will lose me.\r\n\r\n\r\n_PS: My technical knowledge in that regard is limited. All rights reserved._\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "Once upon a time there was this pchote who said my previous PC (AMD Athlon II X3 450, 2 GB RAM, Radeon HD 3000) should handle gen2 mods fine and the three complaints I'd raise against that are terrain texture sizes, voxel renderer perf and maybe, MAYBE pathfinding. Neither are related to pathfinding, the first two is GPU, the third... is acknowledged. Resolving the first two is already enough for a good gameplay experience.\r\n\r\nI switched to 64bit in 2016, with the sole reason for my switch was that I got 8 GB RAM now. There are machines shipped with 2 GB RAM even today which doesn't benefit (IMO they even lose) in x64.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge that the idea of 64bit mempools is intriguing but indeed it would probably mean losing more on the player side and I really don't think after XP-drop and the logo proposal drama we need yet another conflict of such a level for now."
