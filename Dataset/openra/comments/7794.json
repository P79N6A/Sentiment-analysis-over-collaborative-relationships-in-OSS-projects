    "body": "I would understand you, if you are afraid of low quality fan made units, i share that fear, but snipers aren't crap or ugly. ;) I see the sniper as the \"new\" allies tents (terrain fitting) - new content, but they are fitting to the rest and extend the game gracefully. Tweaking the balances might be one of the hardest things, hornestly big respect for that, but detecting missing pieces of the jigsaw is the supreme discipline in my opinion. Creating & Adding fitting new content like the radar ping or the sniper included. And that's far way from featurecreap. \n\nI think the developers are capable and smart enough to understand how things intertwine and shouln't be afraid of touching every aspect of the game to improve it and don't stick, or even restrict the possibilities, to the original art-content.\nI just don't think that it's wrong to create new red alertish additional stuff like the sniper.\nTo be exact i think it's just the opposite. It's awesome to find additional details added with much blood, sweat and tears. ;) \n\nDo you know the game dune2 the golden path? One of the best things i saw in that whole dune2 remake was the new Flak Trikes unit. I had to salute to Drackbolt for that brilliant adding.\nOr do you know the Diablo 1 MOD - Belzebub? Same here, a stunning and mindblowing amount of new and fitting content. This mod is better than the official Hellfire addon. But I'm digressing here... Back to OpenRA..\n\nIts not my decision, but please do consider a voting at fb for example. This could show how the majority is thinking about the sniper.\n\nThe other hypothetical way would be to remove the sniper and watch the bounty rising to undo that :)\n"

The shock trooper naturally fits the sniper role, but was left being rather useless because the sniper was already there.  The shock trooper fits the soviet theme much better than a rather generic sniper, so it made a lot of sense to combine the two units using the assets of the existing shock trooper.\n"

    "body": "I agree to that fact that shocktroopers are fitting more to the soviets theme and to the epic battle between Tesla and Einstein. But that's not my point. Even if shocktroopers might now can kill other infantry with a zzap, that will not make them equal. I'm still favouring the sniper. Because snipers can be used a lot more tactically. I see three additional purposeways compared to the shocktrooper:\n1. Stationary hidden scouts:\n   I sometimes use them that way, with a hold fire order \"no attack\". That helps especially when you need to detect enemy movement on the map, because normal scouts like dogs and yaks will get killed or hunted down and can scout once-only. Snipers are a really great way to gain additional view at the front that will support fast hit and run attacks of other units especially if you are facing an basewalking pro allies player. As soviets it's a pain in the ass to find enemy artys standing close to an aa, because of the high range of the artys and the lack of view and additional the gap-gens. In such situations you will be very happy to have the view of a hidden sniper.\n2. The soviet camouflage pillbox\n   Hidden stationary defence in your base, in range of your nuclear silos, techcenters, consturctionyards,.. to kill any evil infantry sneaking in your base, like paratroopers, engineers, apc rushes, chinook drops, phase transporters, and of course tanya! You will definitively have the fist shot.\n3. Oil-deck babysitting\n   Oil decks are often spread over the map, far away, some at smaller islands and rarely in your base. In such cases you can use snipers to catch some enemy engineers approaching. \n\nMake the sniper unbuildable would kill all these nice dynamics.\n"

    "body": "Wow, that's a very good proposal, sneaky hijacker ;) that idea has potential.\nOkey, hidden scout role check!  and new sneaky steal check!\n\nOne thing that I also love at the sniper is that the bullet doesn't have any trace or effect. That supports his sneakiness. -> you can't tell from what direction he was shooting, if hes out of your view. You theoretically could do some evil micro management with fooling the enemy to run back an forth, with more as one sniper.^^ by switching hold fire off and on, depending on where the enemy is. But I never saw that happen in a match.\nThe white trace of atrys for example is a good way to guess the artys position. The same effect will have the tesla zzaap from the shock troopers. but I think that's okey as trade off.\n"
