Chat message lifetime is designed for reading multiple lines of text  and needs to last longer than notification lifetime (bound to an ingame event).\r\n\r\nAnother thing I thought about is that we might want to have some more space for additional text lines: missions currently use the chat widget for showing both mission objectives and \"story chat\" which does not seem ideally. We could consider to add additional dedicated lines for primary and secondary objectives in the future that have their own lifetime. "
