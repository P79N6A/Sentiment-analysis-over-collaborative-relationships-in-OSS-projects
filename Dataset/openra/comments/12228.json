    "body": "@StexoO thanks, not keen on that solution, I was thinking adding a per-building cooldown timer on infiltration could be good. I.e. if a spy infiltrates a refinery that refinery can't be infiltrated again for 30(n) seconds, that way you can't just spam spies into a ref and steal the entire bank, and power down requires some skill as you will have to infiltrate different power plants to keep them in low power. This would also fix the spy lock when base pushing. Be good to get some opinions on this.\n"
