    "body": "@Trychlik, does it persist when changing to desktop and back again to OpenRA? Also, are they active every time you start OpenRA? I do rarely see the dock enabled, but switching (using the four-finger swipe gesture on my Macbook Pro) to Desktop and back again to OpenRA seems to disable it."

    "body": "This is a general macOS \"feature\" that affects all games and other applications that use the \"fullscreen desktop\" API to integrate nicely with mission control/spaces, cmd-tab switching etc.\r\n\r\nYou can switch to \"Fullscreen (Legacy)\" in the settings to work around this, but beware that this will also disable swiping between desktops and cmd-tab.  It also does not work properly on the current release with Retina displays (#13216), but we'll fix that for the next release.  Apple doesn't provide an API to disable hot corners without also disabling these other features, so there's not really anything more we can do here, sorry."
