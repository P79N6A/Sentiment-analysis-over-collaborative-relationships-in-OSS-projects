    "body": "@reaperrr \n\nThats the point lol. Gun turrets do decent damage to structures EXCEPT Guard towers cause their damage type vs wood is only 25. I put it up to 100. The same issue was on AGTs as well as they did 100 damage type vs heavy and armored but only 25 to wood. Which means these defense structures did next to no damage at all. (IE: the guard tower can out repair gun turrets shots and the guard tower can kill the turret). This makes it so guard towers are killed by the correct structures and units.\n\nThis also enables flamethrower infantry and grenadiers a better solution at killing these structures. (As wood damage type vs flame damage type)\n"

    "body": "@GraionDilach \n\nThen the problem persists. Because base destruction will cause affect due to GTs able to take out Turrets due to their disadvantage to the wood issue. Since GTs use no armor affect they count as wood and turrets, AGT, and obli make them soaky and tanky for fire. (Let alone the GT can kill gun turrets and even AGTs which should not be possible) So this would actually be a major problem with structures all basing under wood.\n\nEDIT: On the side however there are a few solutions, One being a pain in the rear in which to create a new armor type for structures. The simpler one is to have it modified in the yamls as it is. Because with the MCV cost increase it will be difficult for players to mass up turrets and do base crawling. Which in effect would fix the GT issue with the other defense structures. \n\nIf none of these seem like good ideas however then I can delete and recreate to fit the major current issues. The GT issue has some up a few times in the past (About a release ago) just no one has caught on yet.\n"

The explicit 100 versus values can also be removed.\n"

Im not good with this coding business so that will require a lot of trial and error to get done. While the solution was lobbied about half a year ago may have worked it created a loophole issue vs GT of defense structures and created a bottleneck issue. As for reverting I have no idea on how to do this and will close the PR and recreate.\n"
