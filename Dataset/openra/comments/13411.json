Though its a lot less rare for it to pop up and im still having issues claiming a specific point.\r\n\r\nIn the future when I do my games in TD or RA I will have a pen and paper near me to write down the time of the game and then recheck the replay to see if it happens in there. If it is not caught on the replay then will mark more specific by pen and paper."
