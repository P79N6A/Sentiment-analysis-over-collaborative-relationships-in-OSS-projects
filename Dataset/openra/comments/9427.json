    "body": "All I can say to this is \"tough...\".\nA 20-year-old game's assets are naturally not meant to be visible on a miniature screen with 4k resolution. Neither are modern-day games, for that matter.\nThe widgets (radar, build palette, etc.) are intentionally unaffected by pixel doubling.\n\nAnd \"zooming\" has been discussed a lot and has been decided it's just not feasable with those assets. Also I'm pretty sure we already have an issue open with a feature request for \"zooming\", so if you don't mind I'll close this now.\n"
