    "body": "Great work! I'll follow up with an ingame / usability review later, but for now have a major technical comment.\r\n\r\nI raised this issue in the earlier discussion, and I'm afraid I'm going to have to insist on it now that it has made its way to a PR: chrome.png is generated from [chrome.svg](https://github.com/OpenRA/ArtSrc/blob/master/cnc/chrome.svg) and should never be edited by hand.\r\n\r\nPlease update chrome.svg to add anything that can be vector based, and then create a new 512x512 raster format file (ideally xcf or psd without any photoshop-specific features) for the pixel based sidebar backgrounds.\r\n\r\nVRAM is precious, so please try not to duplicate UI elements unnecessarily. The sidebar artwork could be made much more efficiently by having a single shared frame, with smaller cutouts that are drawn on top ingame for the faction logo and the faction-accented buttons areas."

    "body": "Thanks @pchote ☺️ I will wait for any usability reviews before addressing the technical matters. I was not aware that chrome.svg existed. I'm not sure that I'd be able to pull it off entirely without Photoshop effects but I'll see what can be done. \r\n\r\nThe duplication of assets was intentional because I based that on TS chrome and I wanted to have distinct skins for each faction. That idea didn't quite work out but I decided to keep the layout.\r\n\r\nIs it OK that I split off `bits.png` and `dialog.png`? I assume that I'll need to file a PR to the ArtSrc repo with source files for them? "

Textures should only be split off if the benefits outweigh the potentially non-neglible performance degradation it may bring."
