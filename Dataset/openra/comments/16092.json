    "body": "This is `AttackMove`'s long known bogus behaviour biting us, again.  The `AttackMove` trait relies on `INotifyIdle.TickIdle` running to recover itself and queue a new `AttackMoveActivity`.  Implementing `INotifyBecomingIdle.OnBecomingIdle` on `Aircraft` means that this now never happens.\r\n\r\nThe proper fix here is to rewrite `AttackMove` to use child activities.  This is far too big of a job to do on the playtest timescale, so I think we can get away with bodging an explicit `AttackMove` check into `Aircraft`'s idle handler."
