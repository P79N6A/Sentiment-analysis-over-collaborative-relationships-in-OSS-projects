    "body": "Balance can be further adjusted when we get this merged, but in my opinion. RA mod should keep Generals Style the long timer reusable engineers. Afaik ZxGanon has plans to introduce the KW like short delay consumed engis to TD mod. D2k can keep the old behaviur so we have all the engi logics shown in our main mods. Best probably would be to hear more from the community tho.\r\n\r\nAlso about the blnking trait? Can we get ability to play a sound for each blink and make delay between blinks get shorter and shorter as capture goes on as in Generals? Would be nice to be able to replicate behaviour there."

    "body": "Yes I have been waiting for so long for this change.\r\n\r\nI canÂ´t wait to implement this into Shattered Paradise and my TD Mod since this is just the most modern and balanced way to implement engineer capturing.\r\n\r\nAlso since lobby options are impelmented everyone can customize it (if not implementing it as a must have like we are gonna do in SP).\r\n\r\nExplaination:\r\nThis Engineer trait introduced into Kanes Wrath was a way to balance out engineers that did instant capture in the previous game Tiberium Wars. It was a hellish overpowered and instant win mechanic to capture key structures without being able to defend them in any kind of way so all factions went for this start. It was disguting to put it simple.\r\n\r\nWith this counterplay is gonna be enabled while finally removing the lock on production facilities. Conyard can now finally undeploy when trying to capture them or even selling structures off if not able to defend.\r\n\r\nOf course this will weaken capturing a lot and there is the neat to rebalance this in TD and SP like shortening the captruing time in SP from 7 seconds to 5 seconds or giving Oil Dericks a capture ammount upon taking an Oil Derrick but this is gonna pay off.\r\n\r\nBut still keep in mind that you still have to spot the engineer from capping your structures and that even happens in RA where capping takes roughly 12-14 seconds so I see no issue in implementing this.\r\n\r\nNow coming to RA:\r\nI would say that touching the RA Engineer in terms of multiplayer should be done as you tried to express pchote. Implementing the changes while providing lobby options for people to still keep the old capture way we have in the current release.\r\n\r\nWith that people can try out both ways."
