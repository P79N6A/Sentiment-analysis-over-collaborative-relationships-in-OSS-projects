Other Allied factions might think twice before spamming them, as they are more time / cost consuming.\n\nAlso, you can get the cash trick by sending an heli transport full of spies, an APC, etc ... not necessarily by base push, and for an instant cash boost (too late for enemy to react)\n\nThere is no other faction who can get this cash boost, so I think this might cause a balance problem, especially for late games on low resources maps.\n"

    "body": "Sorry, but :-1: from me here. I think this should stay as faction special and thus allow \"faction special tactics\". Also there are a lot of maybe's in the example, your opponent could detect the transport, have a camo pillbox near to the refinery and you still need to block your infantry production queue by producing the spies while your opponent can use that time to get units out (-> this tactic is kind of a risk maybe? For each spy you can get one rocket soldier or two rifle men).\n\nBack to my original argument (the last one isn't too good actually): You should still be able to get kind of an advantage of choosing the British faction, why should you play it if it is the same (even worse, as the other factions have stuff the British doesn't) as other factions?\n"

Whereas they'll never hesitate to use them for a power down.\n\nIf this is implemented -> #10355 , then France would be the only faction who could deter usage of spies, which would make sense IMO (maybe with new Fake buildings, like fake PP, or even fake Ref ???)\n"
