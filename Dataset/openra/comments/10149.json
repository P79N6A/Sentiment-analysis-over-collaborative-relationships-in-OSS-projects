The question is probably where to draw the line: which effects are required for gameplay: removing corpses e.g. might cause some irritations etc. but if the whole plan won't make the game run smoother on less powerful hardware, then we don't need to pursue this further.\n"

So the performance impact isn't too bad.\n"
