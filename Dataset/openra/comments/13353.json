Please pick a convention (IMO having the civ husks with civs and tree husks with trees would be better, since these are legitimate map props.  \"Normal\" player-unit husks are temporary actors that probably shouldn't be exposed in the editor in any mod).\r\n* RA i'm not sure if it's worth having the spy plane, or badger variants accessible in the editor.
