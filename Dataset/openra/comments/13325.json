    "body": "I assumed the high ping occurs on each joining of lobby, but seems only first time so it isn't so major problem. If someone wanted, he could at first join skirmish lobby to mitigate this issue before joining multiplayer lobby. I am not sure what causes it, seems like initial socket background work and ping being the first order of validated client connection? As it isn't major issue and not sure about how to proceed, closing it atm."
