    "body": "I'm travelling for most of the next week, so also won't have time to give this a proper review. I gave it a quick skim, and two things stuck out:\n- Double check that you aren't using an immediate order to send the activate bot command. Immediate orders are for non-world state (like chat etc) that should not be held up by the frame synchronization setup, and they will desync the game if they manipulate world state.\n- Some maps explicitly disable bots, and this feature should respect that setting.\n\nI also propose that our options for player disconnect should be \"replace with bot\" or \"player surrenders\" - leaving idle actors on the map is rather unpolished. I think we have a ticket for this, but it is a pain to search from my phone. If we do this, then the bot order probably wants to be replaced with a more general synced player disconnected order, and then a trait on the player actor can choose whether to activate the bot or destroy everything.\n"
