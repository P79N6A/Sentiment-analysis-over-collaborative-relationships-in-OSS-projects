    "body": "Nope I was referring to normal click and drag selection with the repair cursor, not repairing bulk units.  So when you click and drag select with the repair cursor, it would act as a normal drag select box.  I just thought since this could be a quality of life issue and since it was also present in the original, I would bring it up.  It would save an extra click when wanting to quickly select units after repairing buildings.      "
