    "body": "I'm concerned that all these individual (\"pot-shot\") balance prs are going to hurt more than they help.  Balance is about more than just individual a vs b stats â€“ everything needs to be considered at the same time to make sure you don't mess up the overall meta.   It feels to me that this is being overlooked with the current collection of parallel / independent balance prs.  I don't mean to pick on you / this ticket specifically, but I feel that something needs to be said.\n"
