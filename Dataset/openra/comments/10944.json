    "body": "When a map is created it will add `MapGrid.MaximumTerrainHeight` to the height to account for the behaviour of the heightmap at the north edge of the map.  This is _supposed_ to exist above the north edge of the cordone, but it looks like this was broken (or maybe never worked?).  Should be an easy fix (one or two lines max).  The default mods without heightmaps will give you the size that you ask for.\n"

But that didn't crashed on people.\n\nNow it tries to draw more rows than what actually exist if the map was imported. So this is quite well related to #10686 as well.\n"
