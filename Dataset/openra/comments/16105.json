So that would need to depend on #16217 and future PRs that fix the other attack variants as well. Since the current approach works and depending on how long it takes to get to fixing those other activties, I'd suggest keeping this as a standalone and making a new PR reimplementing it using `ChildActivity` at a later date."

    "body": "The issue that yaks reject attack-move orders when landed is fixed and I agree that nudging is out-of-scope for this PR. There is one more issue I noticed but that one shouldn't block my :+1: for this, as everything else looks good to me.\r\n\r\nJust for completeness: When you have 3 yaks on one airfield and let them attack-move at some tanks so that they run out of ammo before destroying them, the yaks will continue their attack-move after reloading. However, if you have 3 airfields for the 3 yaks, they won't continue their attack-move after reloading. It looks like that freeing the airfield for waiting planes triggers their attack-move to continue.\r\n"
