So for now, a constant will do.\n\nI've also fixed the sell/repair/etc issue. Apparently that cropped up when I changed around the cancel with an if/else statement. I've changed it so it does an ApplyOrders anyhow like it did before, it didn't appear to break right click and fixed that issue.\n\nIn addition to those fixes, I removed the ApplyOrders under the left button down statement since that apparently is unnecessary now. I know previously it was used to place buildings and causes a few issues since it would order my units around when I made a drag box, now it appears to be obsolete.\n"

With the nuke, it targets the point on the map beneath the support power icon. With the chronosphere you get a selection cursor, but cannot activate it. IIRC, that was the most buggy part of the original left-click order implementation as well.\n- Ordering aircraft back to their airfield by clicking on it does not work, it gets selected instead. Interestingly, ordering units to the repair pad works.\n\nWith left-click order disabled, the following things don't work:\n- Placing buildings\n- Support powers again, you get a cursor to aim this time, but clicking it does nothing (tested on soviet01).\n"

    "body": "Ok, the issues with support powers was due to my last commit about removing what I thought was useless code. I've fixed it to work a bit more intelligently, and this should make it so that when you target a support power, you won't also select what's under it.\n\nThe issue with the aircraft was subtle, but was because of my check for IMove. I just went ahead and did what I figured would be done eventually and added a function on the order generator to see if it overrides the selection. Currently it's just a boolean return function I've hardcoded to return true or false depending on the class. In the future, it might be wise to make it a real get function so that the generator can be more flexible, for instance have deploy override selection only when it can deploy.\n\nIn addition, I added a clear selection for building placement and support power selection when using left click orders so you don't accidentally order your units where the target it. I couldn't find an easy way to do this other than going to each power's order generator and appending the statement to the constructor.\n\nEDIT: Ok, I swear I didn't break the build. Well, there may be lingering errors but this time it looks like it failed to install mono somehow.\n"

    "body": "@SilverlineDev I haven't touched the code in a while but I was looking into adding an option for that. I was going to use a slider for it but had a few issues with it and ultimately decided to hardcode it temporarily. I guess I could look into it again, but I couldn't put an ETA on it.\n\nAs for the latter problem, that's a result of the flag that prioritizes action over selection. I could swap the flag but it's not that easy. If I recall how I coded it, doing so would prioritize selection over all instances of enter and unload. Meaning that you could never load or unload without using a modifier or hotkey. I'm not quite sure how to fix this but I'll look into it if it's a concern.\n\nEDIT: I realized something, the latter issue includes deployment. I hadn't addressed it before because I thought about it from that point of view and figured deploying from inside a selection was a benefit. I'm not quite sure how to fix this, maybe add a check to see if the if the selection is the target (by checking the amount and location of the current world selection)?\n"
