Maybe that behavior could be configurable but I feel the actual problem is there's no quick way to paint water (and to a lesser extent ra interior floors) so maybe a fill area tool gets around this.\n"

If you drag the mouse with a 2x2 or larger template it requires all the tiles under the footprint to be of a different template to what you are placing.  If we didn't do that then you would end up with a dragged line of just one edge of the template.\n"
