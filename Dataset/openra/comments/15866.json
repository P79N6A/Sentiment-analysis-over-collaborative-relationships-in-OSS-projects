    "body": "Tested this on two comp stomps. No ground-breaking regressions spotted yet apart from the one mentioned in the end of the OP. Which IS a gameplay-changing thing, but one I think actually makes the game better as now your units won't have the knowledge about buildings that you don't have - if you see a building under fog you are able to attack it and can continue to attack it even if it was destroyed/sold. Shift-clicking defences with V2RLs and moving on won't work now, you'll have to bring in a scout as well or else your rockets will keep falling onto the cell that once was a flame tower you'd destroyed. Also, you can't send an infantry dispatch on AssaultMove against a base scouted before, because it will get stuck on the first under-fog building as it is able to fire further than it can see."

I also was able to see the AA Gun disappear when it got destroyed, even without re-discovering it.\r\n\r\nNext observation - when I targeted another Power Plant nearby with artilleries, it made possible to select it and see its health bar as well; same for a pillbox. But not for the refinery to the right.\r\n\r\nUpd: AI got those buildings repaired, and I can't select them yet again, nor do I see the health bar.

    "body": "Updated with fixes for all the points @netnazgul raised, but I haven't had time to test these thoroughly so would appreciate if you could repeat your testing and confirm no new regressions.\r\n\r\nUnits that don't explicitly define `TargetFrozenActors: True`, and which aren't being force-targeted, will now move within sight range rather than firing into fog.\r\n\r\nRe lack of update rules: we can't access weapon stats from the actor updates, so theres no way to detect and warn about units that may need to have `TargetFrozenActors` enabled.  I think the best way to handle this is with an entry in the SDK update notes, which is how we have handled similar changes in the past."

The attack cursor will switch from the out-of-range version to the in-range version when you hold down the modifier.  Frozen actors flash when targeted, so I don't understand your comment there."

    "body": "Also there is another potentially annoying feature that will be hard to approach: targeting units that get out of vision. \r\nOne of two bad outcomes is happening - either your unit loses the order alltogether (when it was standing still when given order to target), or the attack order gets converted into a move order (when it was moving during retargeting). So on a periodic vision (like Yak's vision) you practically have no option to attack at all because the order will be dropped each time. You can sometimes force fire the cell when units there are out of your vision, but force-firing while you see the unit makes that a simple attack with the same problem as above. On the gif below I was unable to attack 2 rocket soldiers at all.\r\n![openra_fog-actors-attack](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1614714/49750906-2683f200-fcbd-11e8-9c58-f049c3add4bc.gif)\r\n\r\nOn an unrelated note this happened. Replay viewer shows 200% speed as \"194% speed\" at this moment, so probably something else broke in the process. I can provide replay for this:\r\n![openra_fog-actors-attack2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1614714/49751273-086ac180-fcbe-11e8-9a49-d50622f5ee35.gif)\r\n\r\nAnd in the end the game finished with a crash identical to the one above, with lots of my units in an assault-move.\r\n"
