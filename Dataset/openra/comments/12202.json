All \"misplaced\" tiles are actually missing tiles from the arrakis tileset.\nBy using Tile Attribute Editor from the D2k+ homepage and a lot of comparing using openRA Map editor I could find out the missing tiles/tilecomplexes and added 17 new templates to the arrakis.yaml.\n\nNow eight more missions (only BLOXBGBS for now) all are generated without error :):):)\nvery happy about this! :)\nI will commit my arrakis.yaml as soon as I have the other tilesets integrated as well. Should be fully backwards compatible since I am not removing any old tiles (though they are mighty wrong sometimes...^^).\n"
