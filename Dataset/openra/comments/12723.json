So when they congregate in an area they venture for a different route. This was a common problem in the original games."

I was just about to create a bug until I spotted this one. \r\n\r\nI've seen it happen with as little as 3 units. As soon as the two slower units clog up a bottleneck in the path, the faster unit approaching from the rear almost instantly gives up and goes a very very longer way around (even though waiting would still have been quicker), often resulting in death by driving via an enemy base.\r\n\r\nHighly frustrating."
