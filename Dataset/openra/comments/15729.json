    "body": "This is proposing a fundamental change in the classic production logic - one of the defining features of the production logic is the choice between throwing away production time (when cancelling a unit) vs getting a more appropriate unit out slightly sooner.  This would also introduce strategies such as pausing production for many items at 99%, and then releasing them all at once when someone attacks you / you capture an enemy facility / etc.\r\n\r\n I wouldn't object to merging a support for this (like we did for KKND's `ParallelProductionQueue`), but I would object to adopting it in our default mods (like I did for KKND's `ParallelProductionQueue`)."

It's only a modifier for pushing an item to the top of the queue - **after** the currently produced item and **without** pausing anything. This is not a fundamental change but a time-saver and a usability improvement. And as others have pointed out this would make specialty units (engies, spies, hijackers, etc.) used more often as you would not have to cancel your whole queue just to train a single E6.\r\n\r\n@matjaeck The production UI is a whole other question that IMO deserves a separate ticket. Right now it's not very user friendly as the production commands and shortcuts are not exposed to the UI."
