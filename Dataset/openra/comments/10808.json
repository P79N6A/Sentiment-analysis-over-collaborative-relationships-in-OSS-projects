    "body": "I have to agree with @Mailaender though, while your way would be the best, it would look complicatzed in yaml and also would overcomplicate the PR as well. (Although I have to acknowledge it would also bring RA2 Crazy Ivans a step closer.) I'd even suggest wait with such until the Upgrade->Condition rename and conditional upgrades, iirc planned by @atlimit8.\n\nA random idea - unsure on feasibility - that the deploy would fire a weapon instead which has the unit artwork via one warhead and have the explosion in another with the delay set in `SpreadDamageWarhead` with a custom `DeathType`, which could only kill the Devastator, thereby triggering an `Explodes` trait specific to this `DeathType`. Although I'm not sure if this is how D2k worked, asin deploying is only one-way and the unit cannot be moved thenafter.\n"

(you can read about the armor types in TibEd) ... then place a couple of tanks around the self destructing devstator -> what happens ? how many do survive ? in what range?  .. do the same with light vehicles in a wider radius ... same with infantry ... and buildings ... \n\nwe should end up \"atleast\" with a good guess on max range and survivability of different armortypes\n\nalso @OmegaBolt or @reaperrr should be able to help here \n"
