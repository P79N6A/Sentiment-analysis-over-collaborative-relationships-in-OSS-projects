    "body": "@penev92 , @epicelite \nthere was a couple of talks ... about the pillbox , changing it ... so it withstands better infantry rushes \n\nalong with the new introduced production-multiplier which gave barracks and helipads/airfields (easy and fast to produce) a significant \"spam rate\" for their units ... we got a \"infantry\" problem generally ... quite early ingame ... ( @chrisforbes might remember the discussion ingame) \nso people start attacking with 20-30+ infantry (mixed) under 3 minutes ingame ... which is very hard to defend , and very often leads to \"packing up the mcv\" (which throws the players back in terms of tech)\n\nso there was a discussion about changing the weapons for the pillbox (different then we currently do) ... even buffing them ? ... cant quite remember ... i had the idea about adding more slots in a pillbox , to increase firepower , speed and so on ... (chrisf or pchote didnt like the idea because its too close to RA2 )\n\ni wouldnt touch the turret , because thats acutally a pretty balanced defense\n"

(you can do that with only 1 barrack) \n\noverhauling the pillbox could fix more then 1 problem for infantry (atleast for allies) \n"

(this could work , if the speed is equal the speed of a heavy tank ... this way , allies could strike apcs down with turrets which actually hit em ) \n\n@epicelite : calm down , tweaking the flame-tower was an idea to reduce the \"infantry-mob-rushes\" under 3 minutes ... you might have had a game vs James ... then you know what im talking about  ...

    "body": "I do agree it's indeed a problem. I do agree that it requires almost no skill or micro control to perform such a rush. I'd like to propose another solution not mentioned here so far.\n\nSince flamethrowers are usually used in early game for rushes (based on my experience), you shouldn't really make any changes to pillboxes whatsoever (because pillboxes are useful during the entire match). My suggestion is to increase the price of a flamethrower. Since it's a rush, it should punish your economy, so if it fails, you should be behind economically. Currently, a flamethrower costs $300. An APC costs $850. Thus, the cost of 1 APC and 5 flamethrowers is equal to $2350. Seems pretty expensive, but maybe it makes sense to make this rush even more expensive by increasing the price of a flamethrower to $500 (the total cost of the rush will be $3350). Also, sometimes I see people using 3 APC's with 15 flamethrowers. Countering this with a single pillbox is impossible (without losing a building or two), so the increased price should not allow a rusher to produce that many flamethrowers.\n\nI also noticed people tend to cooperate and use chinooks (Allies) with flamethrowers (Soviet). I suppose that with the increased price this option is now more viable, because teammates could share the cost of the rush.\n\nHowever, this solution doesn't attempt to solve the problem of easy micro control of flamethrowers. But maybe with the increased price it won't be the problem anymore.\n\nP.S. The new price is the subject of discussion, I don't insist on $500.\n"
