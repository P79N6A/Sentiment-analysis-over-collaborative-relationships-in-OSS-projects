    "body": "At least one of the reasons seems to be that actors are literally \"cutting corners\" when the next cell on their path requires turning. Even actors that don't share cells (vehicles) don't move from cell center to cell center, but rather turn as soon as they enter a cell. I'm not just talking about corners of cells adjacent to their path, but even cells _on_ their path.\nThis behavior is clealy different from the original games and probably contributes a lot to this issue, it might even be the only problem here.\n"

    "body": "As discussed on IRC, that alone doesn't do the trick because it makes actors stop for a bit until they finish turning, effectively slowing them down.\n\nI looked at the movement behavior of the original TD for a bit and noticed a few things:\n- 1. OpenRA's L-turn actually looks relatively fine. However, in TD units would always perform the diagonal move first (unless that cell is occupied, of course), while in OpenRA, actors usually (but not always) perform the straight move first.\n- 2. OpenRA's U-turn is crap and the main problem. In our engine, actors start turning as soon as they enter the first cell, whereas In RA/TD, actors only start to turn shortly before reaching the cell center of the first cell. It also seems the distance from cell center at which they start turning scales depending on the turn rate (higher ROT means they move closer to cell center before turning), while in OpenRA they simply turn as early and quickly as they can.\n- 3. OpenRA performs L-moves where the original performs a `_/Â¯`. I assume this is because our Move code only checks two cells ahead (next + next+1), seems like the originals checked at least next+2 as well.\n\nEdit: 2. is obviously the main problem.\n"
