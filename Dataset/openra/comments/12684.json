    "body": "We have a visualization specifically for setting up these firing offsets, so I don't think there is a good excuse for not having these set up properly.\r\n\r\nConsider the d2k grenadier:\r\n![grenadier](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/167819/22625578/9d1b3f2e-eb92-11e6-914f-2e4de71826f7.png)\r\n\r\nThe square end of the indicator should line up with the end of the barrel (in this case the position of the infantry's hand at the end of the throw).  The low resolution makes it kind of hard to guess, but the current position in this PR (white indicator) is quite clearly off from my best guess (red indicator).\r\n\r\nI'd say that the current position is about 2px too far from the center of the actor, and about 4px too low.  D2k uses 32 WDist per pixel, so that means that the `x` offset needs to be reduced by ~64 and the `z` offset increased by ~128.  Tweaking the offset to `128,0,-96` does indeed look much better ingame.  There is an ambiguity between the `y` and `z` offsets when looking to the sides and the `x` and `z` offsets when looking north/south, but that can be resolved by checking the infantry from the four main facings."
