    "body": "I like the overall idea, but I'd rather `UpgradesActorsNear` not know about `RenderUpgradeCircle`, otherwise that mostly defeats the purpose of having them as separate traits.\nI'd rather:\n- Either have `RenderUpgradeCircle` define a `Range` and let modders set it to the same range as that on `UpgradesActorsNear` (very, very simple, but somewhat prone to human errors).\n- Or do a 1:1 mapping between the traits with trait instance names like `Armament` has. Then `RenderUpgradeCircle` can have a reference to the corresponding `UpgradeActorsNear` and the latter can have a public `Range` property that the first can get. (IMO this is the best option because then the `Range` of UAN can easily upgradable, and RUC will still render at the current range without needing manual changing).\n\nI'd be OK with either of the above, or another option if someone has ideas.\n"
