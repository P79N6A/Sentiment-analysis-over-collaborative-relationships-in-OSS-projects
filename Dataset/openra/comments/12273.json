    "body": "yes that is what i mean. Exept that it also works on any other transport vehicle, so phase transporters, apc's rangers. so for example, you can load 5 mammoth's into an apc, then load 8 of thos apc's filled with 5 mammoth's into a chinook. that would mean that you can load 40 mammoth tanks into 1 chinook. Or any other combination that you can think of. Cheers, Ohmk Torque\n"
