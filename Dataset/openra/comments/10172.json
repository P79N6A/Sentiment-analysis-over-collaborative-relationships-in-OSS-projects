I note that there is no error-checking code to see if `CreateDIBSection` or `CreateBitmap` fails, and I suspect those functions are failing for some race-condition. I'd need to set-up a native debugger and step-in to SDL to find out what's going on, which I don't have the time for currently, unfortunately.\n\nIn summary: this may be a bug in SDL.\n"
