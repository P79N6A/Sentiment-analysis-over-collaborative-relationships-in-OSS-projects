On maps with larger areas per player, Minelayers are actually starting being used to delay attacks and narrow down attack routes.\n\nShifting the role of the engineer from engi-cap-canceling to an utility unit is not really a bad idea. Using engineers as a mine detector would allow players to avoid building a Minelayer simply to detect mines after which the unit is discarded or put to use laying its own mines by whim because, well, now you have a Minelayer.\n\nEngineers are cheaper and more available, but as opposed to the Minelayer it's slow, fragile and will still die if walking over or standing next to an exploding mine field.\n"

    "body": "@abcdefg30 asked me on IRC to be more explicit with my opinions on these balance topics, so here we go... this is a bit of a meta-complaint, but this pr seems the best place to put it.\n\nEngineers are one of the most iconic C&C units, and i'm not comfortable with moving the RA engineers even further away from that formula, even if it does improve them from a purely gameplay perspective (keeping the external capturing after we fixed the technical issues with the \"classic\" behaviour is bad enough... and contributes directly to the current problems that they have)\n\nModernizing/tweaking the balance to suit modern expectations is one thing, but it shouldn't be a free ticket to let the holy-grail of perfect gameplay override all other concerns.   The C&C/Red Alert names come with expectations, and we have a responsibility to constrain our changes to respect that.\n\nOf course, different people have different opinions on the best tradeoff between gameplay and faithfulness, so this argument is a giant messy can of worms.  IMO the large majority of our changes to RA and TD are solid improvements that broadly respect the gameplay mechanics and themes of the originals.  RA Engineers, however, are one thing that I've long (and loudly) considered we got wrong, and I see this ticket as taking us even further in that wrong direction.\n\nTL;DR: A sad :-1:\n"

Soscared said: ~mines are finally be used. \nI think making them more easy to detect will harm the useage of mines again. \nIt's that thing in my opinion to force the other player to also build minelayers for that detection, that makes mines just that good. \n\nAlso think about 800$+Service Depot + warfactroy vs. 500$ +barracks\n"
