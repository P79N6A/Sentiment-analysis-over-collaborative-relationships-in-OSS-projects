    "body": "Hi @antoniomdk,\r\nfirst of all, the change should be added [here](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/OpenRA.Game/Map/Map.cs#L634). You'll need a new Trait for it (which *must* be in `OpenRA.Game`) to check which actors should be drawn as well as which color should be used. One problem is that you have to get the footprint of the actor (in order to draw the size of it on the map, not just a point), which could be solved by moving `Footprint` to `OpenRA.Game`.\r\nNote that this would be my way to draw actors on the map preview and it is probably not entirely correct :).\r\n\r\nIf you have any further questions, you can of course join our IRC channel #OpenRA ([link to wiki](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki#community-resources))."
