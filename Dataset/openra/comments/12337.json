    "body": "I just wanna plant a red flag on this issue. So far players have engaged the playtest minimally but from what little I've seen so far (very little) the path-around friendly mines fills me with profound apprehension. As of now I don't have the data to back it up but for what it's worth all about me tells me this is a potential pit fall. Right off the bat I have difficulty imagining less than arena-open maps not being sealed off cheap and fast once players realize how easy they can eliminate wide flanks and passages with invisible mine walls.\r\n\r\nJust for the record I'd be more comfortable with _positive proof_ that this specific feature doesn't break balance. As discussed earlier regarding balancing, official play-tests generally functions sub-optimally thereof as even the most dedicated ones can't be bothered with switching mods and organizing playtest games. Once the switch mods feature is implemented between official releases and playtests that could change.\r\n\r\nAnyways as stated before I generally want to avoid feature specific inclusions that affects balance but this seem like a minor feature/performance tweak that may have more than reasonable ramifications for RA's balance."
