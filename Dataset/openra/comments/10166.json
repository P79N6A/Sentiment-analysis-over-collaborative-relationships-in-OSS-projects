Also true for any other unit from that same structure that is set to auto?\n\nBecause we want to make sure that you cannot auto-queue unit compositions, becasue then I really have to agree with penev here (\"Hjelp! My game is playing itself\" - a.k.a.: \"Look Ma, no hands!\")\n\nTL;DR - It would be overkill if you could auto-queue more than one unit (compositions). Also keep in mind that this would make auto-queueing unit compositions instantly possible in TD since multiple construcion facilities give you multiple queues.\n\nI have the feeling that this would have a far greater impact on TD than on RA in bigger games.\n"
