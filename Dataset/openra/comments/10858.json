Additional information which can be added later is placed to another field.\n17:32 <+ihptru> removing it from yaml will leave description field empty. Nothing is going to be broken.\n17:32 <+pchote> we will still want people to be able to add descriptions for the resource center\n17:32 <+pchote> and then maybe edit them too\n17:32 <+pchote> using fields on the site itself\n17:32 <+ihptru> this exists\n17:32 <+pchote> oh, I didn't know that\n17:33 <+ihptru> people always could add more info, most of them do it\n17:33 <+ihptru> and then can edit, or remove\n17:33 <+pchote> does it just use the map description as the initial value?\n17:33 <+ihptru> yes, and additional info is concatenated afterwards with new line.\n17:33 <+pchote> great\n17:34 <+ihptru> api serves that too\n17:34 <+ihptru> example: http://resource.openra.net/map/hash/445031937c804e22c431cb9565c44208d38ccfe0\n17:34 <+ihptru> `description` and `info`\n17:35 <+ihptru> first from yaml.\n17:35 <+pchote> ah, makes sense\n17:35 <+ihptru> http://resource.openra.net/maps/9204/\n17:35 <@orabot> Title: OpenRA Resource Center - Map details - Abnormality\n```\n"
