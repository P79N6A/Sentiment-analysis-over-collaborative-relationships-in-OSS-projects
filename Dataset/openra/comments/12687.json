    "body": "I would understand that some assets for Snow weren't made because they were never used in-game considering Westwood didn't introduce an editor until Red Alert.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, considering OpenRA is a fan-made modernized port, making duplicates of the missing shore tiles and river tiles shouldn't be too difficult considering a lot of the assets are more-or-less identical from TD to RA (aside from extremely subtle difference in grass or dirt color).\r\n\r\nHaving not experimented with the OpenRA iteration of the RA editor, it might have the missing tiles. \r\nAlso JUNGLE isn't too different from TEMPERAT so recreating some of the missing beach tiles shouldn't be to difficult. \r\n\r\nI wouldn't know myself since I'm more familiar with the visual side as opposed to the programing side but, I do know that TEMPERAT (either in TD or RA) has all the beach and/or river tiles that JUNGLE and SNOW or WINTER are missing (whichever is the one with grass but patches of snow as tiles ).\r\n\r\nAlso, I should clarify that the JUNGLE theme is missing beach tiles."

    "body": "While I do understand that tiles don't exist in some places, couldn't some be exported over from RA to TD? I know RA has all of the missing beach tiles for every theme except the Winter/Snow one and the Jungle theme but, the Jungle only makes sense because it was a custom-made theme (that strangely was in cnc.net RA but, not in OpenRA RA). \r\nWhile naval combat isn't a thing in TD, the palette is definitely suffering from the lack of tile pieces to even make a complete coastline.\r\n\r\nI actually wasn't too surprised when I saw that no one tried taking advantage of the dinosaurs to make Isla Nublar. When I thought of taking on the task, I quickly hit a road block because there was only Beach tiles to make lakes and ponds but, not coasts (exclusively inward facing Beach tiles)."
