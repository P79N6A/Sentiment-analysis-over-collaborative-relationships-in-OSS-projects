It might work now, but once someone adds (critical) rules to `UpgradeRules.UpgradeActors` or `UpgradeRules.UpgradePlayers`, it will just silently stop working, and I can almost guarantee that no-one will catch it before we release it. Let's just leave the unsupported map formats properly unsupported.\n"
