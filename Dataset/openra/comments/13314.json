    "body": "I guess you're right, although I can't come up with any examples (unless bridges fall into that category already?).\r\nI still think we should untie shapes from `Health` though, as the above advantages would still apply.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should move it to a dedicated `HitShape` trait, afterall? That way, we and/or 3rd-party modders could make other stuff like `Shield` traits etc. interact with shapes, while avoiding clashes with `Health`.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think we can or even should leave this PR dedicated to its original purpose then and deal with any shape trait refactoring in its own PR, but in my opinion multiple rectangle shapes are still a better solution for asymmetric structures in the legacy mods than resorting to skewing shapes (that's still a desired feature on its own, I'm just not convinced we should use it for the legacy mods)."

That's what the `Target` code falls back to on all actors, anyway. `TargetableLocations` does not really make the actor targetable afterall, that's what `Targetable` is for.\r\n\r\nBasically, moving HitShapes to `TargetableLocations` and then adding that trait to the actors in your example should not have any impact, let alone cause any regressions, because the `CenterPosition` of any actor is considered a 'targetable position' on bleed already.\r\n\r\n\r\n*However*, the actual problems I see are that \r\na) having the shape reside on `TargetableLocations` might be a little unintuitive to some modders, and \r\nb) making shapes disableable via conditions will likely be tricky due to the way they are loaded (out of scope for now, at least), so having them on a conditional trait when they're not disableable would be misleading.\r\n\r\nMaking the shape a separate trait is probably the 'safer' and more future-proof approach."
