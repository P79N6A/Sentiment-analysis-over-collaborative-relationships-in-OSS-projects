Managing your production is one of the key features of the game, and is certainly one of the biggest deciders between an average/poor and a good player.\n\nDo any other modern games (outside of AoM) include this feature?  Unless there is a precedence in other well known games (and therefore a reasonable expectation for this to exist), then I don't think we should include this feature.\n"

Also true for any other unit from that same structure that is set to auto?\n\nBecause we want to make sure that you _cannot_ auto-queue unit compositions, becasue then I really have to agree with penev here (\"Hjelp! My game is playing itself\" - a.k.a.: \"Look Ma, no hands!\")\n\nTL;DR - It would be overkill if you could auto-queue more than one unit (compositions). Also keep in mind that this would make auto-queueing unit compositions instantly possible in TD since multiple construcion facilities give you multiple queues.\n\nI have the feeling that this would have a far greater impact on TD than on RA in bigger games.\n"

    "body": "All this does is remove mindless click spamming to reach a number and not any significant thought. However, with #9595 for directly canceling and CTRL + SHIFT + left_click used to queue say 100 (or enough to last at least a long game), this can be approximated.\n\nThis is incompatible with #9595 since that uses CTRL + right_click for something else. Also, right clicking is associated with canceling and left clicking with queuing. Therefore, this should use CTRL + left_click.\n\nPlacing \"PR: Changes Requested\" for switching to the more orthogonal use of CTRL + left_click instead of CTRL + right_click.\n"

I could use autohotkey to get this same effect. \n\nLets be honest here, this only solves one problem, having to micro your build queue on broken maps, or broken units. The two units (I only play RA) that will see this, is Arty and SHOK, maybe a few others but not to the levels seen by these two. \n\nWhy did you set units to defend by default? Why do miners do searching for gems/ore? why are there rally points for buildings. These are all the game \"playing itself\" except not really... if you set a bad rally point, kiss your units good bye, auto queue the wrong unit, good buy cash hello steamroller.\n\nAnd just to make sure I hit every point, if you really want to go with the whole \" separates better players\" argument, why does every one who plays sovi spam shok inf & flak, and every one who plays allies spam arty and hinds?? Auto queue is a solution to one unit being the only one that anyone uses.\n"

Ctrl-clicking on an icon should auto-queue _that_ unit, and not just toggle the queue repeat.  Proper UX for this as-is would be to have a separate \"toggle queue\" button.\n\nI believe that @r34ch's proposal in #10166 to indicate queue status on the queue icon is a more elegant solution, so on balance I am now against taking this auto-queue feature, even if the ui is improved.
