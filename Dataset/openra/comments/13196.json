The footprint is used for marking occupied positions rather than the shape.

I'll add a target position on the edge of the exit (at the border of the visible sprite), that should be a good compromise.\r\n\r\n> Top parts of IX Res.

In my opinion this is good enough until someone like @atlimit8 implements RectangleUnion or Polygon hitshapes, then we can adapt those edge cases. I wanted to avoid using my hacky per-cell hit-shapes, as that hack will eventually go away anyway.\r\n\r\n> These doesn't look matching.\r\n\r\nI know, I took visual appearance of the buildings into account a bit.\r\n\r\n> An easy fix for these and the RA conyard would be to replace the `RotateToIsometry` flag with a general WAngle rotation angle, and then rotate the shapes to more closely match the structures.\r\n\r\nI don't think that will help on the Ix Research Center, but for the heavy factory and maybe high tech factory it might work, yeah.\r\nEdit: Although rotating hit shapes would a) match the original even less, and b) could lead to overlapping hitshapes which would make it more likely that two buildings receive full damage at once when they're place right beside each other."

    "body": "> I think it's a bit odd to have the heavy factory footprint rotated, but none of the other rotated rectangular structures.\r\n\r\nYeah, I was unsure about it, too.\r\nThe problem with rotating the shape in the pre-TS legacy mods is that the camera angle Westood used for rendering makes it impossible to use rotated rectangles without either a) having the corners of the hit-shapes exceed both footprint and sprite or b) be too small compared to non-rotated, footprint-based shapes of the other buildings.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd vote for dropping the rotation from the heavy factory and using the same shape as the hightech factory and Ix RC, and only tweak the targetable locations to be placed both inside the shape and on the sprite. In my opinion that would be good enough for now.\r\n\r\nTo fix the shapes properly, we'll ultimately need either the `RectangleUnionShape` @atlimit8 suggested or the completely custom `PolygonShape` we've talked about in the past, but that's both out of my league and would make this PR too large, in my opinion."

I'm not sure how exactly to balance that, but i think it would be better to do here unless someone wants to take proper Ornithopter system before Next release."
