This moves the mammoths role _even closer_ to that of the heavy tank and without any changes to turn speed I can't see this actually having a real impact in relation to survivability - its seems more like a random buff for the sake of a buff.\n\nAlso, this proposed implementation buffs the mammoths ability to get in position to crush concrete walls - but where is the late game Allied option to deal with walls?\n"

Even with the help of the Iron Curtain the unit becomes a liability and not worth the investment. Turret turn rate was never an issue.\n\nThe Mammoth Tank could potentially replace the Heavy tank on maps with no manouverability, such as Singles, Doubles and on team games with chokes. No issue imo.\n\nIf concrete walls is a problem for Allies then that should be solved in a seperate issue.\n"

    "body": "Mammoth Tanks have been utterly void in this release and thus so is the argument that the wall crush ability is a sufficient buff. Even the Chrono Tank have seen more light this release, despite being looked upon as an underperforming unit. The fact is, just like with other \"exotic\" units in the RA mod, Mammoths are mostly built for spoofs and by new players. It's built when players sort of shop around the build menu looking for fun units to play. What the zombie-like speed is doing is literally punishing players looking to have fun with the unit.\n\nThe Mammoth Tank getting eaten by artillery fire is at the core of the problem for the unit. Attack or retreat the Mammoth is dead.\n\nEven at speed 50 the Mammoth Tank  is _vastly_ outperformed by the Heavy Tank. Imo, with exception to spammy big team player choke maps, the change isn't gonna get anywhere close to putting the balance at risk.\n\nGet this through a playtest already :+1: \n"

E.g. buffing its HP alone is gonna move it along the route of becoming a \"boss\" unit. A slow beast moving towards you, you'd have to try stopping it like you're player Murto's Tower defense. At worst you'd end up with an exotic mobile base defense.\n\nNo, whatever will happen with this unit in the future it ought not to circumvent the speed buff.\n\n> Buffing speed fixes none of these issues.\n\nThese were never really issues and I'm confused - are you arguing against the speed buff because it won't help the Mammoth Tank become a main battle tank?\n\nThe core idea was to help the Mammoth Tanks role as a breach unit.\n"

The real issue is that no one can agree on what the mammoth tank's role should be.\n\nShould it be an all-purpose upgrade for the heavy? (generally better damage/health and decent speed)\n\nShould it be a Goliath that needs a lot of pounding from units to bring it down (good health, decent damage, low speed)\n\nThese are the two main ideas being thrown around and neither is wrong. What is wrong is that there isn't an agreement of which it should be or if it should be something else.\n\nThere is no point arguing over these kinds of buffs until everyone decides on the role.\n"
