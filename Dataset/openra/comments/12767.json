We need smaller and low eco maps as well.\r\n\r\nIf Forest Path is taken out then I think it could be replaced by Snow Off by Aaron Lloyd: http://resource.openra.net/maps/14675\r\n\r\nThis map is rather similar to Forest Path but way better. Of 1v1 maps I would remove man to man from the map pool."
