It is not quite clear to me what this is trying to audit and why we need it. However a check and a user friendly message like \"don't run OpenRA with administrator rights\" or \"C:\\ProgramFiles\\OpenRA\\Support\\ isn't writable\" might help us have less obvious and repetitive problem reports where people confuse this with a 1995 era game. It seems what Windows users try when things don't work is reinstall, run as admin or compatibility mode when instead they should check their graphics drivers or other common problems from the FAQ.\n"

Graion's intention is to not install mods onto his (smaller, presumably) C: partition, where the user's support directory would be located by default. His solution is to allow installing mods into the game directory, whose location the user can customize during installation. Of course, as mentioned by pchote, that solution is horrible. Users shouldn't mess with the main installation.\n\nThe proper solution, in my eyes, would be to allow the user to specify the location of the user's support directory as well. This is currently not possible, afaik. Then people would be able to move their stuff from the C: drive to whatever other drive they wish.\n"

    "body": "After thinking some more about it, an even better solution would be to split the support dir into a \"Settings\" and a \"Content\" directory. The former would contain settings.yaml, news.yaml, motd.txt and the Logs directory and be located in the same place where the Support dir currently is. The content directory would contain the Content, mods, maps and Replays directories. Its default location should probably be the same place as the settings directory, for compatibility with old installations.\n\nThe advantage would be that we can just use a normal game settings property that gets saved to settings.yaml to change the support directory and won't have to do any gymnastics with command-line parameters and editing shortcuts. Another advantage would be that the location of the log files would remain fixed. Also something similar was already planned for Linux: #10374. On Linux, the launch-game.sh script should move the directories on the first run after the change. I don't know what should happen on OS X.\n"
