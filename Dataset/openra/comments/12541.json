    "body": "> Using the SPG can cause unintended placing of buildings because the cursor focuses irregularly on the SPG, instead of a reliable and fixed section.\r\n\r\nDo you have any images demonstrating this?  I'm strugging to visualize how moving the fixed point from the center of the actor to the center of an arbitrary cell changes anything.  In both cases the actor is fixed relative to the cell grid, so at best you're just moving the boundary for cursor weirdness by half a cell (for even-sized buildings)."
