    "body": "While this will fix the crash, I think it only hides the problem.\nI imagine a reproduce-case would be to place 2 refineries at the exact same spot (last I checked the game won't complain) either via YAML or the map editor. Your fix would just hide the (actually bogus) fact that there are 2 refineries at those coordinates, not 1.\nI don't consider #8467 a crash that needs fixing unless we can reproduce and debug (and find that there is something else causing it). It is on a work-in-progress map/mission, so that doesn't help its case much either.\n"
