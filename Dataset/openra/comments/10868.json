    "body": "1) Players tab would be the same - everything there seems to be logical. The only thing I would change - \"Slot Admin\" button. I would place it on top so you won't need to scroll down all the way down to reach it. Or you can make buttons always on top (out of players scroll list).\nOr functions can be separated on different buttons. Like this:\n![orateams](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17611709/13493198/bb048b12-e14d-11e5-93f9-84d373c41334.jpg)\nDifferent setup functions can be placed on top of list: configure teams, configure bots, configure colors for players (I miss the standart 8 color pallette, though).\n\n2) Music control - well, I don't know the real reason why player control can't be placed in the corner of the screen as small simple panel. \"Prev, Play / Pause, Next, Shuffle On/Off, Select track (popup list)\". Then you can change music anywhere from main menu to depth of mission selection or map selection.\n![oraplay](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/17611709/13493504/839c5978-e14f-11e5-9501-ce380e212f9a.jpg)\n"

    "body": "With regards to the player tab, I mean the specific design implementation: in our existing UIs tabs are attached to the top or bottom of a scrollpanel or bin.  The player bin has a static row of labels (which don't scroll) above the scrollpanel, and the player rows are then inside the bin (which do scroll).  Placing the tabs at the top means either removing the labels, moving them inside the bin, or having a scroll panel nested inside a bin: none of these are very good options.  This is why we placed the tabs at the bottom.\n"
