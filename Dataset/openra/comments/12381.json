    "body": "This now also removes the upgrades lint check until the conversion is complete.\n\nThe old lint check was validating the old system where you granted as many upgrades as you needed, but never ones that you didn't need, and then each trait can only care about one thing at a time (e.g. `notmobile` which is granted by N traits and consumed by anything that needs to know when the actor can't move).\n\nThe new system inverts this, having traits grant one specific condition per action, and then traits can combine these as they want on the consumer end (e.g. `waiting-for-pickup` on a carryable actor that could be consumed by 0..N traits).\n\nRight now we're stuck in the middle of these two approaches, and can't meaningfully validate _either_.  Instead we get false positives that break the build.\n"
