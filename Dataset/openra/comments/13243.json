    "body": "You're right: With the release of Windows 8.1, the behavior of the GetVersionEx API has changed in the value it will return for the operating system version. The value returned by the GetVersionEx function now depends on how the application is manifested.\r\n\r\nApplications not manifested for Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 will return the Windows 8 OS version value (6.2).\r\n\r\nI added this small .manifest file with listed supported Win 10 in this PR #13244 for consideration of inclusion."
