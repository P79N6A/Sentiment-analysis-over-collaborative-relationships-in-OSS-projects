This is most in line with the philosophy with AppImage, which is \"one app = one file\". But from the above I get that you don't want this.\r\n\r\n2. Like with every good rule, there are exceptions, in which it may be desirable not to strictly follow the \"one app = one file\" approach:\r\n\r\n* If one main application calls other helper applications, the helper applications should not be shipped separately but be included in the main application AppImage. \r\n* If multiple applications share a lot of resources, it also may be desirable to ship them in one big AppImage (example: LibreOffice). This may be the case here?\r\n\r\nSo if you would like to go the second route, put all of your applications into one AppImage and write a  custom \"menu\" GUI that lets the user select one of the tools when the AppImage is double-clicked."

One of the main focuses of development in 2017 was to decouple the different applications to enable a unified installation and integration experience for both official and third party mods.  The second route is a non-starter because it regresses this work.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that OpenRA is philosophically a software collection, and our users expect to be able to download the three default mods in one go.  Getting three for one has been a core part of the project's outreach and marketing.  For example, this is how the macOS disk image looks:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.openra.net//images/news/20171014-dmg.png\" width=\"600\" />\r\n\r\nProviding separate AppImage downloads is the easiest and cleanest option from a technical perspective, but it is sad to break tradition and I expect it will generate some complaints from users.  The extra work to redo the download page will delay being able to adopt this, but on balance I think AppImages are still going to be worthwhile."
