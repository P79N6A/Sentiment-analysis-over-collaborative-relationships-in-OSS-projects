    "body": "0 - switch between 'No Team' players so works for 1v1 without team and for players having 'No Team' in team game. It doesn't work for 1v1 when they are in Team 1 and Team 2.\r\n1 - switch between players in Team 1\r\n2 - switch between players in Team 2 ....\r\nIMO there are no configurable hotkeys due to simpler/natural implementation for keys 0-9 mapped to Team number 0-9.\r\n\r\nI assume this is feature, not bug. Configurable hotkeys could be added, but I don't think it is needed."
