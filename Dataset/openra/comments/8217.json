It may also block reflection and dynamic libraries, which would completely rule out openra running there.\n- The mobile platforms don't support OpenGL (only the ES versions), and so somebody would need to rewrite the rendering code and shaders.\n- There are still a bunch of situations where performance becomes unbearably bad on normal computers.  Even if somebody were to resolve the above points it is unlikely to run well.\n"

The Xamarin SDK has been [open sourced](http://open.xamarin.com/), Visual Studio 2015 has a free [**_Community_**](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) flavour for open source projects that incidentally also supports the entire Xamarin framework (albeit, limited to Windows & Mac OS X for development) and Microsoft has [released .NET Core 1.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/06/27/announcing-net-core-1-0/) as the foundation of .NET for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux! I understand that the absence of Linux as a development platform, courtesy VS 2015, is a big let down (is definitely the case for me). My knowledge of C# is at a very elementary level and my understanding of the internals of OpenRA is zero. I'm a big fan of your work :alien: and understand how much of an effort it would be to go mobile. So, I merely wonder if these announcements bear any significance to the project with regards to mobile platforms? \n"
