    "body": "Units will exit the repair pad in the direction of the rallypoint, so if that cell is blocked, they won't leave. To prevent that, I usually set the rallypoint to the opposite direction of the front lint (ie. opposite from the direction where damaged units would most probably approach from) immediately after placing a repair pad.\n\nHowever, we could of course try other exits when the immediately obvious one is blocked. That doesn't currently happen.\n"

    "body": "Not only does a unit on the exit block unit movement  but a unit on the entrance will stop it from entering and buildings + terrain will stop a unit following the rally point as it tries to take the quickest route (straight) and becomes stuck. (steps to reproduce: place a building between the repair pad and its rallypoint ending).\n\nI noticed something very unique though, this rally point will cause the unit to actually displace every unit along the route UNLESS the other units came from the rally point. This is only attributed to the repair pad, all other rally points work as normal.\n"
