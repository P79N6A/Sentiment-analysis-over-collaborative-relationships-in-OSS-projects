I was going to change the PR to nerf shockie health to a more sensible level (60hp) but also increase the charge time of the german chronosphere to 3 minutes, as both factions are simply too good.\n\nAfter I want to tweak country specific units (buff phase tank dmg, demo truck speed, fake structures damage)\n\nThe final PR would be all the 'underused' units of the game (light tank, longbow, hijaker etc)\n\nI will close this for now.\n"
