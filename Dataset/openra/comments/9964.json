    "body": "@r34ch I understand. I fully agree GPS should be offline at low power, since the building is also powered down. \n\nI do not think this would throw off the balance though, maybe it will restore some balance late game, where it becomes hard to play against anyone with GPS up and running. This also (maybe even more so) counts for other Allied players.\n\nI just don't think powering down the paradrop does much balance wise, nor makes sense since you can't power down your airfield. \n\nMaybe you should have the option to power down your tech center? Although you should not have acces to the tech units either when the power is down, same counts for Soviets and the radar dome IMO.\n"
