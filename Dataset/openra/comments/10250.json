Making the light tank too strong can disrupt the balance further. Maybe the flactruck could also get a vision range increase (it got its attack range nerved anyway, and it already has trouble hunting down hinds late game).\n\nI also think Soviets need something that can provide vision, now that vision got even more important. I think the Hind is just so much easier to use as the Yak for vision, having a second unit with a large vision range would be very useful to counter basewalking or chokepoints as a soviet player.\n"
