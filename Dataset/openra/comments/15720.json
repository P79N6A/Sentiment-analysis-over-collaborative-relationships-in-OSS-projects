Its entire job is based around changing the actors state depending on whether its footprint is revealed or not!\r\n\r\nI suspect it may be better (less edgecases, more perf) to create a new `IDefaultVisibility` trait for oil patches if you still need it."

    "body": "Discussion in IRC clarified that this is trying to solve an issue where buildings that have only `=` (bib-type/pathable) cells in their footprint are never revealed even when there is active vision.\r\n\r\nThis happens because `IOccupySpace.OccupiedCells` doesn't return these pathable cells - and can't, because the main purpose of this interface/method is to return cells that should be inserted into the ActorMap and block pathfinding.\r\n\r\nFalling back to `frozenStates[byPlayer].IsVisible` probably works here because the `FrozenActor` visibility calculation is based on `BuildingInfo.FrozenUnderFogTiles()`, which does include `=` type cells.\r\n\r\nI believe the correct fix here is to change `self.OccupiesSpace.OccupiedCells()` to `footprint` in `IsVisibleInner` (adding a new `AnyExplored` extension overload that accepts PPos), but this will of course need to be tested."
