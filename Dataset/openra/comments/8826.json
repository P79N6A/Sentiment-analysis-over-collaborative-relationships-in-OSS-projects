    "body": "This is a funny one. Crates have a default lifetime of three minutes. Due to the size of the map, the badger aircraft apparently took longer than that to reach the drop location, so the crate died while it was still in the aircraft, and when it was time to drop it, the game crashed.\n\nI guess a reasonable fix would be to only increment the lifetime counter if the crate is actually in the world, which would probably better reflect the intention of the Lifetime property anyway (ie. the time that the crate should be available for pickup in the game).\n"
