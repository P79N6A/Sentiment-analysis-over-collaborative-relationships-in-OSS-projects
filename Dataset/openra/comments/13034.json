    "body": "> If OpenRA is in Fullscreen mode, there will be graphical glitches\r\n>If OpenRA is in Windowed mode, it will run perfectly\r\n\r\nFrom OpenRA's perspective these two cases are identical.  The \"Fullscreen\" mode is simply a borderless window that is positioned to cover the whole screen.  The \"Fullscreen (Legacy)\" mode works somewhat differently.\r\n\r\nThis makes me think that this is a bug in your GPU drivers.  Have you tried updating those to the latest version?"
