    "body": "I'm not convinced about the \"Dune 2000\" label. This is the case in all mods when you lose a unit - you instantly lose visibility. I think a workaround for that specifically for the worms will be just a big hack.\nWe could, however, keep player visibility of the area for a second after an actor dies, which will also fix this.\n"

( for the same reason , i do want all \"aircraft\" types to act the same as in d2k , not reveal any shroud )\n\n![dune compared](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9139965/6557904/f71afd2a-c678-11e4-940e-a4d1167721da.png)\n"
