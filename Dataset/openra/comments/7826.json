Steps to reproduce are the same, but since it has more limited \"range\" its just a bit harder to reproduce (but still quite easy).\n\n**I forgot to mention (from the start) that it doesn't show up in replays, just during play - if that helps finding the problem.**\n\n**UPDATE:**\nI just tested the \"old\" 20141029 release and it's also present there to the same extent as in current playtest 20150405. So I guess it's now the way it always was, and it is less obvious than in previous playtest.\n"
