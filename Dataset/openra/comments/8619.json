    "body": "OK, I'm going to be blunt.\n\nYou already had a PR about this that was way more complicated that it needed to be. Because of that a lot of developers spent _a lot_ of time on it, including myself. _Then_, at one point, it reached a dead end. Instead of just closing it, I decided to give it a last chance, and spent around four hours of my time to rewrite it in a much simpler way. (Please keep in mind that even before I did so my opinion was that enough time was wasted on the PR by so many people for no gain.) Ultimately the PR was closed because you didn't want to use my suggested solution.\n\nNow you are opening a new PR about the same thing (which is more than likely unfinished feature-wise). The code looks like a slightly more complicated version of the code I suggested for your previous PR, plus a (unnecessary?) `Tick()` method.\nYou say that you \"haven't even tested\" my suggested code. (?)\n\nIn light of that, I am going to -1 any solution that is more complicated than the one I proposed, unless you can explain how it is better than mine.\n"

(I don't know how to do this.)\n- Store `playersByTeam` in a data structure like Dictionary<> instead of querying it every tick. :white_check_mark: Or cache `IOrderedEnumerable`.

If that's a problem, team labels could be omitted if total number of teams exceeds a set number.\n\nIt is better to have separate Tick and Draw methods. It allows for separation of tasks. Tick does game state dependent logic, generates the actual text that will be drawn. Draw is only responsible for drawing on screen. It gets a list of texts and draws them. This has benefits for the following cases:\n- ~~When there is lag and Tick frequency is lower than Draw.~~\n- ~~When game is paused. Tick stops, Draw continues~~\n- ~~If in the future, Tick and Draw frequencies are decoupled, Draw could run at much higher rate than Tick. I think currently it runs with the same frequency as Tick (when there's no lag).~~\n\nThe other reason you listed is that this is more complicated than the version you implemented. If that is so, you should open a PR for it so we have a better implementation. It was nice of you to write that code to help me and I got some ideas from it. But what do you want now?\n"
