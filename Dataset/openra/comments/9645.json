    "body": "It's en edge case for the launch angle & speed determination logic - since the missile is spawned at height zero and the lookahead gives zero as maximum height at zero distance ahead, the missile thinks it is at the edge of a cliff. This is an invalid condition in and of itself because it should explode the missile straight away, but the logic tries to handle it by setting the launch speed to minimum and launch angle to a maximum. Setting the speed to  minimum however makes the missile explode before it reaches the heli.\n\nThere's a new PR in the pipes that'll have the logic a lot cleaner and simpler which should probably avoid things like this.\n\nRight now there's a simple fix of not considering the missile launched with zero height and cliff distance zero ahead as actually having a cliff in front of it. Another one would be setting the launch height of the SAM missile to at least 1 (since with the new logic any missile that finds itself with height equal to zero at any moment, obviously apart from the instant it is launched, should explode). But I'll file a PR with the first fix and then see about the best solution in the follow up PR to #8717.\n"
