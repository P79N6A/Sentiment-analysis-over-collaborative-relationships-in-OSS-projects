    "body": "An alternative approach which is simpler, but less robust.  Including it here for completeness, but I think the method above is better:\n1. The client receives a `HandshakeRequest` from the server, with no changes to what it currently contains.\n2. The client generates a random blob, PRIVMSGs it to a dedicated IRC bot, and adds it to the `HandshakeResponse` along with their IRC name.\n3. The server PRIVMSGs the IRC bot the IRC name and blob from the response.\n4.  The IRC bot returns either true or false depending on whether the blob matches what it has stored.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that it can behave badly if there is latency in the IRC connection: the server may be able to query the IRC bot before the client message goes through, and this will cause the authentication to falsely fail.\n"
