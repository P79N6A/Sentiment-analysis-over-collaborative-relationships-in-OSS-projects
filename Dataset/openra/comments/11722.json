The  Launch block is right in the middle of this file (between the graphics and server blocks), with no indication that this has nothing to do with settings.yaml.  The first sentence of the page claims \"This documentation is aimed at server administrators.\", but those arguments aren't used for servers either.\n\nWe should not be shipping incorrect documentation in our installers, so we should not be merging this without clarification to either the purpose of the documentation, or its content. :-1:  That has _everything_ to do with this PR.\n\nAlso shame on you for calling review feedback invalid because _I didn't catch the issue early enough_.  I had made it clear well in advance that I was going to be busy with work for all of July and most of August, and that I wouldn't be available for seriously reviewing PRs.  There wasn't any indication from the notification chatter that those docs included the Launch block, which is valid for the man page, but invalid here.\n"
