    "body": "Units are moving in a real engagement. Pulling back tanks when you can when one is damaged. Harder to do vs Light Tanks however as they move faster then Medium Tanks. Specially since the game still has the slight glitch where you can circle a unit and they won't shoot. When considering terrain locations its pretty even in most regards. Usually its whoever makes the first move loses their stuff. Unless they play smart and use artillery with aircraft for sight. The main issue as I said is light tanks can out power the medium tanks by just a slight amount. Considering, that medium tanks take twenty seconds to build and light tanks take fifteen seconds. It is a pretty easy way to catch up. Specially if used with E3. Losing tanks as GDI comes up as more time costing rather then resource costing.\n\nThis however, I think is fine in determinations of speed. I do like the speed differences of medium and lights. This I believe is fine.\n"
