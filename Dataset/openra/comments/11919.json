On Linux, the driver only gives you 3.0 but at least that works flawlessly.\n\n@ROCKNROLLKID I have a backup PC with an Intel GMA 950 GPU which could run Win10 x86 good enough for my mother - on the Microsoft GDI software renderer. I've also used a Radeon HD 3000 integrated for a good while with OpenRA (which I used from '11-12 onwards, first with Win7, then Kubuntu 12.04 and ultimately with Win10). I have no idea where you got the idea that 1 GB cards are required for Win7, also pretty sure the playerbase would heavily disagree you there.\n\nYes, OpenRA uses textures. Generated from spritesheets, so pretty much all the feats you listed are useless in this case. Bumping the minimum requirements **is** a problem - even dropping XP was for some. This is not the game AAA gamers play or pick up even, so don't apply gamer PCs as primary target.\n"

Yes, it is not required, but what I meant was, in order to run Windows 7 - 10 without any slow downs or issues, you need to have at least a 1 gb card, atleast for the x64. I understand x86 is a little more lightweight so maybe users there can get away with only 512mb card.\n\nAnyways mailaender and chrisorbes made it clear they have no plans for right now, but maybe someday it will happen.\n"
