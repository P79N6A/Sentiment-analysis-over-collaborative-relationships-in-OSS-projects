    "body": "Hey, SoScared, I was just looking through all your fixed up maps. They all look great so far, but this one has me ever so slightly worried, I'm worried that the way you have the spawn point ore patches set up it slightly favours the northern player.\n\nBecause of the refinery orientation and preferring to keep the bulk of the ore south of the refinery the southern player would be encouraged to build their refinery in the northern half of the ore patch where it'd be more vulnerable and the southern player would more likely put their's in the northern half of their's too where it'd be better protected. It's a minor issue but I still think it could be a balance problem.\n"
