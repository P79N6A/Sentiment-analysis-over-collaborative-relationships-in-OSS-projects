    "body": "@SoScared Please feel free to make changes as you see fit, you make a valid point. \n\nFwiw my reasoning was such; The large ore patch hinders base placement for those who stayed in spawn. Those who moved out at game start could get good eco with a single large base (3 mines in each corner plus the two in the middle if you didnâ€™t mind redeploying your initial MCV a couple times). It almost made little sense to stay in spawn.\n\nBy splitting the ore in spawn it gave people in spawn a little more room for defensive placement of tech structures and by removing 1 ore spawn from each corner, lessened the advantage of taking and entrenching these areas so early.\n\nThat said, I didn't think of the changing 2 REF start. And it was only theory crafting.\n"

    "body": "Here's the upload of mine (see screenshot): http://resource.openra.net/maps/8905/\n\nThe only changes was the original patch and I re-positioned one of the three ore mines at the corner expansions to free up more space for more equal ref placements there. The three ore mines at the corner expansion are almost void of ore so it cannot support a build-up of ore harvesters alone. If a player wants to move the MCV from the start he may take that chance but that's gonna require the player successfully take full control of the middle ore as well as the expansion to benefit the move.\n\nI suggest integrating the ore patches this way to your map to preserve the map's intended play-style.\n"
