Would make the computer a lot tougher in certain missions (maybe good for making a mission 'hard' on hard mod) (though maybe make sure you can turn it off on certain defensive structures?).\n- Make a setting on structures/units can be critical to keep or destroy to win the mission.\n\nAll of this would reduce the amount of script writing to a minimum. Would also mean making the rest of the campaign would be so much faster.\n\nThough like I said this is probably asking way too much, though one can dream :)\n"
