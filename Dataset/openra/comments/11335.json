You disguise spies by selecting the spy and right-clicking on an enemy infantry unit, whereupon your spy takes on the enemy unit's appearance - color, weapons and all - and shows a little moving eye symbol on its top right to indicate that it's disguised. Play the fifth allied mission (\"Tanya's tale\") to try it out for yourself.\n"
