Namely that managing the buildqueue is part of the game and should not be to 'easy' and should work intuitive? \n\nThe idea of a priority unit is not to autoproduce it, but to put 1 (or more) units in front the queue. Like in a discotheque: there is a long line, but suddenly a V.I.P. comes and the manager decides to let the V.I.P. in next, and all others in the queue will go after that.\n"

This one is about giving a player more fine-grained, manual control over an in-progress queue without having to wipe the slate clean and start over.\n\nAlthough a better, long-term solution might be something resembling Starcraft's queue, where items in the pipeline could be visually reordered, a ctrl-click (or whatever) to add units to the front of the queue (letting the current unit finish) seems uncontroversial (to me). It would just be a matter of PushFront() instead of PushBack(), without any new UI.\n"
