I have seen this before and I actually experienced this myself while building my own RTS engine.\n\nPathfinding wise, you could have the naive heuristic saying shrouded areas are always passable. Of course, when traversing the path a unit encounters some non-passable entities/terrain and your path finder kicks in again. This might be a bit expensive, but 'first make it work then fast'. (making fast could be doing partial path finding till the next node in your path you where unable to reach?)\n"

I'm not sure about how C&C does this, but I believe the behavior there is to have an optimistic 'shortest direction' movement. Ie, no path finding, just take the best cell to move to. Until you hit an obstacle and only then calculate a path.\n\nPerhaps it might help in this case, although it still requires a layered way of approaching path finding. It also is perf-wise much faster because you don't do path finding at all at first. \n\nAlso hitting a unit is not considered an obstacle to use path finding for. \n"
