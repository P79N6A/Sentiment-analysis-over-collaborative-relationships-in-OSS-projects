There are also strange behaviors with spawning points of buildings re affected to strange places with the same idea as previously described .. a building was selected and unselected then another unit is controled and when i come back to the building spawning point has been set silly.. \nFinally, some unwanted building constructions seem to be added to the construction queue.. could be also on units construction queue but more rarely than buildings.\n\nYou can find a replay which is showing a group of 4 soldiers that are located in the middle of the map,\naround 30s , When they were selected the order was to attack on left side (i'm intensively using attack key when i'm playing. ) then i have selected another unit or building (can't remember what is was..,also  too bad that selection can't be shown during the replay) and then you will notice that the 4 soldiers group will change direction to the right just like another order was given... but it wasn't at all, then i need to re select and re assign a new attack to the left.. :-/\n\nAs it occurs a lot when i'm playing (really too often definitely) , i think it is a bug related to this previous topic rather than myself doing silly/strange things with the mouse or keys.. ^^\n\nyou can find the replay there : \n\n http://www.jeuxdecartes.ovh/data/OpenRA-2016-10-selectionBug.orarep\n\nhth\n"
