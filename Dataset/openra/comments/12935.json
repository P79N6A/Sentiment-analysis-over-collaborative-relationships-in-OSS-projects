The 'decoration' on the 4P and 6P versions do not match cell-for-cell but the differences are v. minor. \r\n\r\nI'll probably upload a last revision of the 8P map soon, maybe tomorrow. I'm not sure if I'll get to the larger ones. BLACK's versions have several clipping errors and should not be included in their current state. \r\n\r\nThe 10P Order of Battle by BLACK really squishes the back two spawns together and punts off some tib trees to the sides.. It looks a bit off and to be honest I'd want to have a crack at re-doing the spawns more 'properly' if there's going to be a 10P version of this map included. I'm not sure if I'll get to that soon, but can do if there's a real call for this to be done.. Re SoScared's comment above, yeah the reduced tib should somewhat discourage v. early base expansions on this map which will probably improve it.\r\n\r\nThe map pool is def. a step forward and while I'd probably have some further thoughts I think it's looking a lot better :)"
