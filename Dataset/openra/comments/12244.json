    "body": "Yes, you are right. I thought initially about replacing the Tile-ID while converting with a simple `If(blox****):switch:case` statement in `GetTile(int tileIndex)` of D2kMapImporter.cs, replacing the few exceptions where the \"lazy\" method fails. (it fails because the frame-IDs for the same terrain feature can vary significantly for different tilesets)\n\nBut there were tiles missing. This is also a reason why vanilla blox\\* wont work without new tiles.  So the tileset has to change anyway. Also often tiles were falesly integrated into bigger templates (like what should have been a 1x1 tile was actually on the 2,2 position of a 2x2 tile). Would be very tedious to solve this if it is at all solvable. Also, there were allready(!) duplicates (i.e. ID 386 and 359) in the tileset.\n\nAlternatively, we could make a tag that hides the (manually identified) duplicate templates from the user in the editor. \nOf course to find the duplicates ( for ID converting) i first had to put them into the editor, so I did just the yaml edit which allready fixes everything...\n\nWhat do you think? which course of action would be right, and why?\n"

    "body": "For one, I am interested in d2k map scripting! Not directly the mission maps though, but as a side product (i want to make cooperative versus play (playing missions human v human ). The first map is nearly done.). \nI wanted to contribute to openra as a side product, too. I could have just fixed the neccessary maps in the map editor not getting this project forward an inch, but decided to try a fix for ALL maps instead. If you tell me now that won't consider this even though there is no better solution right now, i wonder if it is worth to put any more time into contributing. All potential campaign scripters first have to face the problem that there are few flawless maps to work with!!\n"
