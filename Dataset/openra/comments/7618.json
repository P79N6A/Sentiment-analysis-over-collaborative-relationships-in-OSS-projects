    "body": "@obrakmann  Yeah, it definitely should, that's the same error I ran into. Looking at the stack trace the error happens when the harvester wants to deliver the resources and then tries to find a refinery, but all of them are crowded (3 or more harvesters per ref). This then generates an infinite loop in the makePath function of the pathfinder.\n\nMy changes allow that in the unfortunate case all refs are crowded, then it will take one of them nonetheless.\n"

I could see that if there are no available refineries, there is a wait time of 1 second, inferior to the 2 seconds span of the pathcache. Everytime you access a value in the cache, the ticks are refreshed back. That made the harvesters loop into an infinite zero-path calculation and stay there forever unless you explicitly move them.\n\nPlease fetch and reset again and try please.\n"

The heuristic now considers the distance between the search point where you clicked and the nearest resource that there is in that position, so that now goes first for the nearest resource that it finds in the point you clicked (previously it was quite \"random\"). But yeah the heuristic needs still some work and to be revisited.\n\nThe priority thing in harvesters is something that already happened in the past. That corresponds to another area. As I've said harvesters' code needs a refactor. Once it's done probably we'll be able to detect where the problem originates.\n"

    "body": "OK, this looks good ingame. I had 3 refineries and 30 harvesters and there was absolutely no blockage.\nI'd merge this as it is, but I want to clear something up first.\nImagine you have 1 refinery and 10 harvesters. You send all harvesters to harvest simultaneously. First 3 finished will \"reserve\" the 3 refinery \"slots\" (refineries seem to allow only 3 reservations). The rest, when full, will sit idle at the resource field while the first of those 3 unloads. Then one of the idle harvesters will go to the refinery to wait in line, while the rest continue to sit at the resource field.\nThis can be very bad if you are harvesting a resource field that is far from your base, near enemy territory, or especially when playing D2k.\n\nP.S.: I just realized that the \"no more blockage at the refinery\" is actually a result of \"no more than 3 harvesters may approach the refinery at a time\", which IMO fixes an annoyance, but introduces an even bigger problem.\nI'd like to see full harvesters with no refinery at which to unload to move ... maybe behind the closest refinery? That way:\n1. They won't sit in the middle of nowhere, waiting to be picked off by enemy scouts/raiding parties/worms.\n2. They won't block the harvester that is currently unloading.\n"

    "body": "Yeah, I think it still happens on bleed if the harvester can't find a path to the refinery (it is completely blocked already). But now if the refinery is completely free, just reserved (by 3 harvesters that are far far away), the other harvesters still won't move.\nI know there's no perfect solution here that will magically fix all problems, but I said which I think would be best for the moment and why. Once that is (if it is) done, I _may_ address the \"behind the refinery\" thing in my (eventually coming) docking fixing PR if that is out of your scope/interest.\nIf you want, you can wait for feedback from someone else.\n"

Let's just get bleed into a playable state again first.\n"
