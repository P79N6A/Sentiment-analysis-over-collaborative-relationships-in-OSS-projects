It can be achieved with \"almost\" purely a change in how things are rendered, it just keeps on repeating all on x and y axis. Mouse clicks and actions are translated to as if it was one map. \n\nBesides the renderer the biggest change would be pathfinding, so it wouldn't go all the way from one edge to the other edge over the map, but just go straight to the nearest one on the other side of the edge. (left/right  top/bottom).\n\nIt would be cool because no one will have an edge of the map as a defence. Your enemies are always on all sides until you have conquered the whole width or height of the map. It would require special maps, but it would certainly create a whole new and very fun dimension to OpenRA.\n"

    "body": "True it won't be just in or outside the viewport, complicating things and it will probably result in many new errors and visual artifacts. I wouldn't add it high on the list of features. I just agree with Aaron-Lloyd (original poster), the earth map would be a good example to have such a feature.\n\nThat said, it's all about people donating time, so instead of playing the game more, I'll install again visual studio soon and take a look at the code to see what I can do. This sounds like something separated enough for me to be able to play with without blocking the development because I have not enough time to be \"fast\". Is there a means to claim projects at openra? so people are not working on the same thing?\n"
