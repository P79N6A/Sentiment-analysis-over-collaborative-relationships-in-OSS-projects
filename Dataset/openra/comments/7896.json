    "body": "This is basically the same fix we did for the rocket troopers. Unlike those, the helicopters don't try to move back into range when they're too close, instead they just don't shoot. They'll start shooting on their own when the target moves into range by itself.\n\nThis isn't as nice as the rocket trooper's behaviour, but probably better than wasting ammo for nothing. :+1: \n"
