    "body": "@pchote Windows DPI setting is \"standard size (96 DPI)\".\n@obrakmann Where is the `settings.yaml` file located?\n\nAha!\nI changed the window resolution to 800x600 and now the artifact is **gone**. Then i changed the _desktop resolution_ to 800x600 and restarted OpenRA, the problem is back. So that fixed the issue while in Window mode. \nThe difference is that the entire window including borders did not fit inside the vertical desktop resolution; perhaps that was the cause?\n\n**Workaround**\nWith the OpenRA window resolution at 800x600, i then changed it to Fullscreen and restarted. The (entire) issue is now resolved!\n\nAlso, since this workaround i was able to reproduce the issue in Window mode by using an Y resolution above Screen height, but not any more in Fullscreen mode, where i saw the black bar. That suddenly works as it should.\n"
