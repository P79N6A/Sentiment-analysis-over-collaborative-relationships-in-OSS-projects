I'll try to give proper context for each group of commits when its ready to PR, so it shouldn't be as intimidating as it might first look.\r\n\r\nAs a nice side effect, this has forced a solution to the `MoveAdacentTo` target line weirdness, which was the last big blocker for fixing #2598. It may be feasible to resurrect #14384 for Next + 1 after this."
