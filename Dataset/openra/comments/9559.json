    "body": "This is exactly how it works in C&C Generals. Both selection box sizes and UI aspects work 100% the same. The old games also had the HP bar above the units and the pips below.\n\nI don't see the logic of changing just because a bunch of noname recent strageies/MOBAs (I seen that design at them moreso) apparently made this differently.\n\nThe sole thing I can agree with is that the health bars need a way to make the overlap distuinguishable enough (TS/RA2 used an SHP for the HP bar which had ticks and outer edge for this reason but I prefer the engine effect I think) butr everything else sounds like kicking a heritage straight in the face.\n"
