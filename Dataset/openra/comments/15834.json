    "body": "That is true. \r\n\r\nThere is still some kind of identification nowadays, and filtering. \r\nCurrently, in case of lag and in general, all spectators are asked to leave one by one (sometimes a player appears to be the cause), and usually they're remembered next games. \r\n\r\nAnd in any case, kicking often happens before the start with latency values / colors. \r\n\r\n\r\nI'd argue that sometimes, a game can go well even if players appear to lag before starting. And vice versa. \r\n\r\nIt is punishing for the players, and the potential spectators, not to be able to know where the problem comes from. And after deciding a re-make due to lag, it results in kicking a lot of spectators to avoid potential lag."
