    "body": "I'm using 3 different shellmaps on Generals Alpha, and map selections seems pretty random to me.\r\n\r\nI don't really remember what temperate shellmap exactly was like. I know it was Sov10 and i use same map on Generals Alpha too, but complately different set up. My main point is that i really would like to see another shellmap on RA, it doesn't have to be old temperate shellmap (map is pretty small too, i see the map edges on 1366x768)."
