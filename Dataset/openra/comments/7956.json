Please stop wasting my time.\n\nAlso: One issue per ticket, please.\n\nThat said, we will not return to the old behaviour, as we told you already about a gazillion times. The score screen will stay, although the particular implementation might change. I will probably add the possibility to hide the score screen to pan around the map, and I might even move the chat below the stats if there's enough space, but it's too late for that for the upcoming release. It also depends on how much I feel like dealing with the inevitable shitstorm I now know I will have to endure.\n\nClosed as duplicate of #6865, #6864 and #3037.\n"
