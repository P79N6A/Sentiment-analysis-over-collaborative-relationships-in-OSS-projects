    "body": "I guess that you are running windows with a 1.25 display scaling factor, giving your desktop an effective resolution of 1536 x 864 for DPI-unaware applications.  We recently re-disabled our DPI awareness on Windows, which means that the 1600 x 900 size is now bigger than your effective screen size.  Making the window smaller will fix the issue."
