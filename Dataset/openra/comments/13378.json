    "body": "This was a decision that was made a long time ago, and our code was written based on that assumption.  The field is called `Name`, implying uniqueness.  If we wanted to support duplicates then we would have called it `Type`.  Our rendering traits are written assuming a single armament for each name, and will break (either explicitly or ignore the duplicates) if there are multiple.  Traits that accept multiple armaments accept an array of names in their info.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to argue against allowing duplicate names on a conceptual level, although that does somewhat go against our policy of erring on the side of explicitness in how things are defined.  If you want to see that be supported, however, you will need to rewrite pretty much all of the code that involves `ArmamentInfo.Name`."
