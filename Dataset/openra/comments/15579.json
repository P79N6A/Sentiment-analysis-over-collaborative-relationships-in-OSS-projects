    "body": "From @pchote in #15581:\r\n> I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, this should fix the trees disappearing by making the husk visible, but on the other **we shouldn't be leaking that the tree has died through the fog at all**.\r\n\r\nI had the same thought. Considering they have FrozenUnderFog, the issue described in the OP is definitely a bug, even if we end up using HiddenUnderShroud this still needs investigation as it might (or rather *should*) affect other actors as well."
