    "body": "The single player campaign missions (most of them) do feature different difficulty levels to choose from in the mission select screen before game start. \r\nFor the skirmish mode, the client uses an AI script that is not divided into different difficulties. Instead there are different bots to choose from (Turtle AI, Rush AI, etc...). Instead of a set difficulty rate for a certain AI (which does not exist), the different AI's are meant to provide you with different behaviors/difficulties. \r\n\r\nTry playing around with the different AIs. For example, Rush is more heads on compared to Turtle. Please do keep in mind that the AIs (at least at the moment) do not differ too greatly. Their buildup is mostly the same (except for Naval), but their unit behavior differs slightly.\r\n\r\nSome ppl are working on the AI once in a while, instead of introducing difficulty levels for each AI (which would make things really difficult to implement) - it is planned to enhance the AIs further to make them more varied.\r\n\r\nUltimately it would be preferable to have more varied AI including e.g. \"Easy AI, Medium Ai...\" select-able."
