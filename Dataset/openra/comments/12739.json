    "body": "@SoScared I’ll rank my views from 100% on board to minor disagreements. Overall this is a good set of changes and as always thanks for the work you put into this and for putting up with our nitpicking.\r\n\r\n**100% On Board**\r\n\r\n**Barracks/Tent HP reduction, MCV build time increase and +1 Paradrop:**\r\nThanks for taking the testing of OMnom’s maps into account. I know it was late in the process and with different methodology; but between OMnom, Lorrydriver, km, Barf, Medium Tank and myself we had a large amount of high level games played with these values.\r\n\r\n**Flame Tower:** As a general rule I don’t like to see static buffed just to balance it vs. other static. However it would be a heckuva lot more work to balance Allies and Soviets vs the base crawl using another method. I’m on board with this change.\r\n\r\n**Neutral:** \r\n\r\n**Yak and Mig vision, tech center health, MGG build time reduction.** These are probably fine. I don’t have much to add.\r\n\r\n**Destroyer:** This game has boats?!\r\n\r\n**Nitpicking:** (This is more thinking out loud than outright opposition)\r\n\r\n**Mobile Radar Jammer:** This is already strong and used normally in games that reach T3. My main concern is the extra cell of vision and the extra cell of missile jamming. A soviet player could be in a lot of trouble if they don’t keep a Yak alive vs this. \r\n\r\n**Light Tank:** I thought this was a bit too much damage in the testing I did. I know they seem worthless at times but I view the light tank sort of like the grenadier; a niche unit that works situationally. Currently the light tank is good with pressure openers and late game with mass chrono-crushes and raids as Germany. As I always say, there’s a huge difference between underused and unused.\r\n"

I'm under the strong impression that MRJ's have little-to-no presence in the late game whatsoever. Certainly not normally. With exception to naval maps (coast guard protecting against destroyers) I've seen sporadic attempts at integrating the unit into the meta with various unit compositions but that's about it. Care to elaborate?"

Off the top of my head I can think of games vs Barf, FiveAces and OMnom where MRJ’s were used effectively by myself or my opponent.\r\n\r\nI will say that if I don’t build an MRJ in T3 play it’s more because I forgot to build the thing in the first place; I always want one in my composition as allies. A standard tank-led army can win the day with one in its current state. It’s a high micro unit that requires you to keep tanks in the four cell ‘safe zone’. And if one shows up against you it is a high priority target. \r\n\r\nThen again I’m one of the few guys who likes to build Mammoths late game so you might want to gather some more opinions.\r\n\r\nOn a separate note, and I meant to add this to my original comment, getting T3 out in the first place is a concern right now. I reckon it's too late for the next release but I would like to see efforts to address this. I'm in favor of reducing build times of the radar dome and tech center, OMnom favors his tab edit, and others want to reduce build times for T3 units. Something to think about going ahead."

This is a personal preference but I regard T2 as being still immature in regards to a big chunk of it got exposed very recently with the map pool and competitive overhaul of 2016 and still has great growth potential. This will to a certain degree push back T3 development somewhat in that T2 will be slightly redefined by further tilting strength in favor of standard army play vs base play - placing additional risk on moving towards tech.\r\n\r\nParts of this PR are balance changes that slipped away in before the current release."

    "body": "Copy/pasting part of a recent conversation between Fortnight and myself, also addressing @Smittytron on the Light Tank feedback. Because why not:\r\n\r\n- - - - - - - -\r\n\r\n**Fortnight wrote:**\r\n\r\n> \r\n> To me the Light Tank is actually in a pretty good place in 20161019. It dominates all other types of early vehicles with offensive capabilities (Ranger, APC, Mobile Flak) and it is produced quickly and travels fast.\r\n> \r\n> I did a test with the new changes. In 20161019 it takes 3 Light Tanks to be able to win against 1 Medium Tank, after the buff it just takes 2 Light Tanks (one will survive with around 25% HP remaining). It might make sense that two tanks for 1400 credits should be able to beat one tank for 850 credits, however there's more to account for than attack power.\r\n> \r\n> What worries me is that this Light Tank buff diminishes the purpose of Medium Tank. There's few things in RTS games that matter more than mobility, speed is such a huge factor and Light Tank is faster on all fronts (move speed, turn speed, turret rotation). And since damage is dealt in small chunks with short reload in between there's less overkill as well (less waste).\r\n> \r\n> Combined with the shorter production time and lower price I can't see much reason for having slow Medium Tank armies after the buff when you can have larger (for the same cost) and much faster Light Tank armies that sweep around on the map, able to outrun any threat and chase down almost anything.\r\n> \r\n> Those extra 5% againt heavy armor may not seem like much but going from 40 to 45 is a 12.5% buff and those 12.5 add up when you start having three or more Light Tanks in the mix. Harvesters already can't escape from Light Tanks, now they won't even have time to try and escape.\r\n> \r\n> You also don't need a Service Depot to build Light Tanks, another reason why they should be much worse against heavy armor than Medium Tanks. Since more buildings is required before being allowed to build them (a Service Depot needs resources in credits, power and time) they should at least be useful on some front compared to what's already available from the War Factory.\r\n> \r\n> Concerning the 10% buff vs Light Armor I don't think it's needed because in 20161019 a single Light Tank will destroy a V2 Rocket in about 6 seconds while a single Medium Tank takes 12 seconds to do the same. So Light Tank already has a purpose in taking down light armor very effectively.\r\n> \r\n> Another thing Light Tank does better than Medium Tank is killing infantry, in 20161019 a Light Tank will kill Tanya (or any other infantry) roughly twice as fast as a Medium Tank. So not only do Light Tanks run over infantry easier due to their movement speed, they also do more damage when firing at them (and is able to change between targets quicker). \r\n\r\n**SoScared wrote:**\r\n\r\n> As for the Light Tank buff I think I understand your concern but I don't share it. The Light Tank won't be able to replace the Medium Tanks mid-game as long as infantry/vehicle army compositions is a thing in RA and the way the map pool has been developing and is continuing to develop we're just going to see more of it after the next release. The abysmal armor HP of the Light Tank makes it relatively useless as a damage soaker compared to the Medium Tank. The damage output buff makes it stronger in wolf-packs yes but that requires you to sacrifice Harvester/Medium Tank/MCV production and so far no-one has successfully managed to take advantage spamming Light Tank/infantry vs conventional play in the past ca. 8 months the Light Tank buff has been part of playtests. The most apparent reason for this, assuming the Light Tank is utilized efficiently, is that the opponents just turtle for a few minutes while getting the extra expansion up or building up their Medium Tank army and just brawls through the map with very little resistance. Occasionally top tier players tried their best to base their strategy on Light Tank as the main army components taking advantage of the damage buff but it just wouldn't work. Notorious Light Tank users such as Gatekeeper also never managed to risk the meta with this Light Tank and that should count for something.\r\n> \r\n> Buffing the Light Tank damage output seeks to help it hunt down light vehicles and finish off damaged harvesters and MCVs out on the field, extending its expiration date just a bit further into the mid game instead of being immediately squishysacked into a blob of infantry because of their inevitable uselessness. From mid-game and up the Light Tank fails to compete with production of Medium Tanks/MCVs/Artillery and various T3 vehicles.\r\n> \r\n> Having said all that, there's noting 100% for certain in game balancing so at the end of the day we'll have to wait and see. As for the unit in relation to e.g. rebalanced strength of the rocket soldiers and whatnot that's an issue I'm sure to be discussed during the next release cycle"
