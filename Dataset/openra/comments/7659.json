Ofcourse the AI uses game information to make decisions because having an AI 'predict' where you will be placing buildings/units the same way humans do is pretty hard. But maybe the AI shouldn't directly go for the best kill, instead go for the second best location to bomb/strike. That way it's less frustrating for (new) players, but still a challenge to win. It's not fun when it's too easy.\n"
