    "body": "The problem here is a \"race condition\" between unbinding the scroll panel during UI disposal and a message being received by the IRC client.  It's not a real race condition because it is caused by our frame end tasks rather than thread safety issues.\n\nI tied myself in a knot trying to outline the exact code flow that triggers this... the key points are that:\n- `ScrollPanelWidget.Bind(null, null, null, false)` runs first, queuing a frame end task to tear down the state but doing nothing immediately.\n- `ScrollPanelWidget.BindingAdd` or `ScrollPanelWidget.BindingRefresh` run next, queuing their own frame end tasks to update the scroll panel contents\n- The (un)binding task runs, removing the bindings and setting `collection` to null.\n- The refresh task runs and explodes because the state it assumed to be sane has been destroyed.\n\nSpecifically, [ScrollPanelWidget.cs#L441](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Widgets/ScrollPanelWidget.cs#L441) is running with `collection == null` and exploding.\n\nI suspect that the best fix here will be to add `collection` arguments to the `ScrollPanelWidget.Binding*` methods, and then check that `this.collection == collection` at the start of the frame end tasks that they queue.  If they don't match then someone has changes the bindings out from under them and they should immediately return.\n"
