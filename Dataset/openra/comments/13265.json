We already have an issue for that: #12057\r\n\r\nIf you mean some people may want defences to go to side where enemies are rather than backlines, i may code that, i think.\r\n\r\n> failure modes on maps where there isn't enough space to place structures\r\n\r\nWell, this currently doesn't spawn them and add a message to Debug.log, as we already do for Starting Units.\r\n\r\nAlso another thing i can do for this PR to add seperate `*SupportRadius:` and a `SupportBuildingsFacing:` tags. As one may want spawn defence Turrets not randomly faced, but units are or make units spawn further so they'll be out of the base for example."
