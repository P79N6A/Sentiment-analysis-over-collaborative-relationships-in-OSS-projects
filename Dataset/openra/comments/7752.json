    "body": "If I read that error message correctly, it seems to complain about a token starting with a % sign, so you might get away with just quoting the path, or even just escaping the % signs with a backslash. I think quoting the whole line might mislead the parser, but I can't really say for sure.\n\n[it seems that the percent sign has a special meaning in yaml context](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#%%20directive/)\n\nAnyway, let's try it out and see what appveyor thinks of it. :+1: \n"
