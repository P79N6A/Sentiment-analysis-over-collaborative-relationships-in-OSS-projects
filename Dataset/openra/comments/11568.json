    "body": "I would say add in the score screen of something as an example up above. But to also have the ability to go back to the map after post game just to see what the enemy had conquered/lost too. \n\nAlso nice little note, Playing as GDI gave the graph bars when it came to unit kills and buildings. If you played as Nod It showed the graph bar and the soldiers dieing in various ways as the bar continued to progress.\n\nPerhaps for C&C95 if things wanted to get fancy you could have the unit commando be animated blowing up a structure if he was used to kill structures or perhaps units.\n\nFor RA96 depending on faction played you could have the british spy being used to animate as \"Spies used\" and with a number. For example of Ukraine \"Demotrucks used\" with a demo truck exploding with a score counter.\n"
