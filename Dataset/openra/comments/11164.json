    "body": "About the creeps/neutral enemy config, I think we shouldn't go overboard on this (read: throw a lint warning, but not an error), since iirc quite a few singleplayer maps throughout C&C games actually used such inconsistent configs (usually in cases where it didn't matter, like unarmed explosive barrels in RA), so this can easily happen when importing maps. There may even be a few missions that rely on that kind of setup.\nIn any case, I think we should only warn modders/mappers, but not enforce it.\n"
