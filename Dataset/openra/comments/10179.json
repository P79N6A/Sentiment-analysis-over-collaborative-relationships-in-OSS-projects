    "body": "The effect differs greatly (RA/D2k) from the one used in TD. I agree that it's sometimes difficult to make out what's cloaked and what's not, depending on the terrain and the number of units deployed. On first glimpse that is, obviously theres a distinct difference between cloaked and uncloaked units, albeit with a higher number of units and a bigger base, this can get a tad unclear.\n\nWith higher numbers of units on screen, the TD stealth effect does a way better job in differentiating between cloaked and uncloaked units at first glimpse due to its \"shining-cloak\" effect.\n"
