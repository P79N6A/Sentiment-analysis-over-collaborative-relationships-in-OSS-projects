Only UI related things (such as delays between sound notifications, etc) should be defined in seconds, and these should all be scaled.\n\nGiven this, I propose a more accurate title: world simulation times should be converted to ticks.

    "body": "An excerpt from IRC, which makes the issue clearer:\n\n```\n11:10 <+pchote> r34ch: think about it this way: imagine it takes say 250 ticks (10 seconds at normal game speed) to travel 10 cells\n11:10 < r34ch> ok\n11:10 <+pchote> and that at the regular game speed it takes a chrono tank 10 seconds to recharge\n11:10 < r34ch> ok\n11:11 <+pchote> a chronotank starting from 0 charge can teleport the same distance as a tank can drive\n11:11 <+pchote> if you increase the game speed to fastest, then it *still* takes 250 ticks for a tank to drive 10 cells\n11:11 <+pchote> the only difference is that the game simulates at twice the rate\n11:11 <+pchote> so that 250 ticks now takes 5 seconds instead of 10\n11:12 <+pchote> if you scale the chrono charge based on the game speed, then it means that it now still takes 10 seconds for the chrono to charge\n11:12 <+pchote> which means that chronotanks are now nerfed by 2x compared to regular tanks\n11:13 < r34ch> so ...some other part of the code takes care of that, so we have to make sure to keep using 25 as the tick rate or?\n11:13 < r34ch> I understand what you are saying in english, I am just not familiar with very much of how the game actually works\n11:13 <+pchote> things that actually do care about real-time seconds (such as delays between UI effects) should account for the game speed\n11:13 <+pchote> but anything inside the world shouldn't scale them\n11:13 <+pchote> instead, we need to make sure that things that use \"seconds\" are instead defined as ticks\n11:14 <+pchote> i.e. instead of defining ChargeTime = 20, we need to change PortableChrono to define ChargeDelay = 500\n11:15 <+pchote> the convention that we use is that times defined in seconds are named with \"Time\" and times defined in ticks are named with \"Delay\"\n11:15 < r34ch> oh ok I sort of get it\n11:15 < r34ch> so 'balancing' things should all be done using ticks?\n11:15 <+pchote> yeah, exactly :)\n11:15 < r34ch> I see\n11:16 < r34ch> ok I'll have another look\n11:16 < r34ch> is 500 the correct value btw?\n11:16 <+pchote> the trait defines the default charge time as 20 seconds\n11:17 <+pchote> 20 \"seconds at normal game speed\" * 25 ticks / \"seconds at normal game speed\" = 500\n11:17 <+pchote> the ra mod rules may change that 20 to something else\n11:17 <+pchote> but the default trait value will want to change to 500, yeah\n11:18 < r34ch> and change to ChargeDelay instead of ChargeTime?\n11:18 <+pchote> yeah\n11:18 < r34ch> ok cool\n```\n"

We don't need to replace them with raw tick values, as\n`DateTime.Seconds(x)` just returns `x * 25`, `DateTime.Minutes(x)` returns `DateTime.Seconds(x) * 60`,\nso they actually just return ticks...\n\nI think the problem at the moment (with the lua timers) is, that `Utils.FormatTime` `WidgetUtils.FormatTime` calls which cares about different game speeds (`<+pchote> things that actually do care about real-time seconds (such as delays between UI effects) should account for the game speed`).\n"
