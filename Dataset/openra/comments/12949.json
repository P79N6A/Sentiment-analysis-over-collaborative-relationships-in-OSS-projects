Then, substantial portions of existing Lua API must be copy and pasted, as most of them has potential to be used by the AI scripters. It will double the cost of Lua API maintenance as fixing bug in one side must be mirrored to the other side.\r\n- Instead, I broke the seal of ScriptContext so that current Lua API can be shared with inherited AIScriptContext.\r\n- Then at the interface between Lua and C#, safety can be checked by checking if Context is AIScriptContext at runtime. This is bad for performance.\r\n- Instead, like what happens for ExposedForDestroyedActors, I introduced ExposedForAIScript. In constructor of AIScriptContext, the commands will be filtered and only the ones that have ExposedForAIScript will be exposed.\r\n- Still there is a little problem. In ResourceProperties.cs, there is a ReadOnlyCash and Cash property. I thought giving cash to the AI for cheating can cause game to crash. I introduced a read only version for AI scripting. Maybe I can modify Cash's set() to check if it is AIScriptContext and reject the action there instead."

However, my focus in this commit is to make AI do build order, unit building and prove that bots can do more complex task than hunting enemy (hunting is pretty much all hacky AI can do as of now). My hope is that with commit merged, since Lua is intended for people at \"modder levels\", they can start contributing to AI improvement, which wasn't possible with C# hard coded Hacky AI."

    "body": "AI test is now as separate mod now. It could be merged into official ra mod later, but for now, I don't like how my 5x speed setup gets into the commit and interfere with official ra mod.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/12949/commits/9d37118d8eba28638a5dd0cd8f090c835e411137#diff-e9b25ee6bdc0322762567826ef993465R54\r\nI've modified binding filters. AIScriptContext is now checked as high level as possible. Predicate is passed down to the lower levels instead. Also, tagging actors as occupied from the script side is now more natural, rather than previous tagging method (which turned out to be not working as the actors weren't IsTaggable!).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/forcecore/OpenRA/commit/c265027f8f065c2602cca3b07d17b812801f08b7#diff-262611b9e40de7482f6e5d523b9d6f33R26\r\n\r\nI don't like how HackyAI is resolved from the actor properties but this seems to be the most sensible solution, as HackyAI is in Mods.Common name space and AIScriptContext is in OpenRA.Game name space. I tried moving AIScriptContext to Mods.Common as HackyAIScriptContext but that didn't turn out very well as that makes (lua) Runtime member inaccessible. Passing HackyAI to AIScriptContext constructor doesn't work either as mentioned above, AIScriptContext is located in OpenRA.Game, the core engine part not Mods.Common."
