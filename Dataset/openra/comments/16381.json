    "body": "I think the current behavior for the attack-move hotkey is weird and not very practical though. The problem is that  it is a strange sort of 'half switch': you can switch attack-move on, but you can never turn it off again without giving an order (unless you activate another order generator hotkey). Yet for some reason it will turn off automatically after you give the first order. \r\n\r\nIt would be much more practical if it would either act like a true switch or as a modifier key.\r\n\r\nBy switch I mean: Press 'a' and the cursor will stay in attack-move mode until you press 'a' again (or another order generator hotkey). This is similar to how the sell/repair/power order generators already work.\r\n\r\nBy modifier key I mean to act just like 'ctrl', 'alt' or 'shift': The cursor will stay in attack-move mode as long as it is held and reverts immediately after it is released.\r\n\r\nPunsho's example would then look like this:\r\n- tap 'a' - hold 'shift' - mouse click - mouse click - mouse click - release 'shift' - tap 'a'\r\n\r\nor this:\r\n-  hold 'a' - hold 'shift' - mouse click - mouse click - mouse click - release 'shift' - release 'a'\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that either way would make queuing attack-move orders a lot more user friendly. (The argument also applies to 'd' as guard hotkey)"
