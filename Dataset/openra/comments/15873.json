    "body": "Might be controversial but I would support it if an attack order would not be transformed into a RTB order when the plane is out of ammo. That they auto-RTB on attack when out of ammo is a significant burden for precise unit micro and only useful when you order them to attack something and then go afk. Instad they should just get a move order.\r\n\r\n> Another idea we could consider - but i'm sure it would be controversial - would be to have aircraft return on idle by default after normal move orders, and loiter after force-move orders.\r\n\r\nI could live with that and it would make sense for me.\r\n\r\nIf you want that your valuable aircraft circle somewhere on the battlefield, the order should be explicitly given and the location be selected intentionally. You can leave your planes in this safe area without the need to babysit them.\r\n\r\nIf you are moving your planes around, you should however always babysit them because you are likely in an unknown / dangerous area. The idea that they auto-RTB on idle makes more sense to me than letting them circle there. I would like it if they auto-RTB'ed at a lower speed than their normal speed. It can punish players for a mistake they made, but the auto-circle-by-default encourages laziness.\r\n\r\nEverything else than letting the plane fly circles already requires precise micro and causes high APM.  I would be open for a discussion how we could make planes and helicopters more interesting in RA and give them better defined roles. That yaks currently primarily serve in a spotter role and are only secondarily used in a strike role makes the difference to helicopters quite meaningless and I think we're missing opportunities due to this.\r\n\r\nAs long as there is no consensus about what their actual role is, the proposed behavior for force move would be a fair compromise IMO that allows investigating how air combat can be made more interesting, prepares players for a new mechanic (potentially used for other mods or replacing the current behavior in the future) while nothing is taken away from anyone.\r\n"
