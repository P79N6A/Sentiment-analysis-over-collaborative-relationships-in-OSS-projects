    "body": "I looked at it as a part of the game. What it did was turned in micro play to firing your turret units at targets while keeping them moving around. However, enabling vehicles to attack targets without giving the order might put some strain on certian units.\n\nIE: Hummers/buggies would be able to do simple drive by on infantry and pick them off more easily. APC units would be able to pick off bikes rather then having them clicked on units to make them fire. Mammoth Tanks would become a lot more deadlier since they are already slow moving targets.\n"
