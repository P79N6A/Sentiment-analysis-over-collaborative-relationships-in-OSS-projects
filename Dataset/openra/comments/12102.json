It doesn't behave the way I feared it would (although I'm not sure why). I'd be ok with it being in the playtest \n> [20:32:51]    &lt;antares79&gt; pchote: I guess the extra ResupplyAircraft invocation can safely go as well. I don't see it being useful\n"

    "body": "Mechanics still cannot heal helos unless they are rearming.\n\nMousing over a pad and issuing a \"land\" command (triple down arrow symbol) with a mouse click has the effect of a touch and go. At the very least, this command should lead to the helo landing in order to get mechanic repairs.\n\n\"F\" command has the effect of all helos clumping to a point near a single helipad, and sometimes jittering/dancing about the point. If you have 3 pads and 3 helos, they should spread out accordingly. If you have more helos than pads, it might make more sense for them to line up at neatly at the rally point the same as when they spawn.\n\nA compromising solution would be to continue your new behavior of rearm - takeoff if the helos return to base of their own accord (out of ammo), but a command of F or mouse click land command should force the helo down on the pad.\n"
