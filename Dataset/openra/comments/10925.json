    "body": "That usage looks fairly typical for release-20151224, especially if you sync maps with the resource center.  The server aggressively caches map data, so the memory usage does grow over time as players switch between maps.  This was a design decision rather than an unintentional leak.\n\nWe are aware that server owners didn't like that behavior, and the next release will completely change the way that maps are loaded and cached to reduce this.\n"

    "body": "You are right, memory consumption depends dramatically on number of maps loaded.\nWith built-in maps it eats approx 60 MB, however with all ra maps from resource center (32 MB disk space) we are at 450 MB of memory. Whoa! :-)\n\nI appreciate that decision, In the meantime I'll disable custom maps. Memory is very limited (and expensive) on my Virtual Server.\n"
