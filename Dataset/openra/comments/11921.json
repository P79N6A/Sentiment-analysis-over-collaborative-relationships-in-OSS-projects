    "body": "Sorry, but this isn't going to happen.  It is completely infeasible for two reasons:\n1.  There are no suitable cross-platform GUI toolkits we could use. Winforms and WPF only work reliably under windows, and we are not going to force everyone to install GTK just so that a few windows users don't have to go outside their comfort zone.\n2.  The utility is not a single static program.  It is a thin dynamic frontend that aggregates disjoint command modules implemented in mod code.  Each command would have to implement its own GUI, which would be a prohibative amount of effort even if it were possible.\n"
