Someone should close this ticket, it's such wrong.\r\n\r\nIf one wants to completely replicate the Kirov's bombing path behaviour, use AttackHeli with a relatively huge FacingTolerance (I'm using 30), give the Kirov the actual GravityBomb weapon with the range from where it should start bombing it's path (so something like 2-3 cell ranges) AND give the Kirov a dummy weapon with a really small range which will trigger the Kirov to still try to closing on the target while attacking.
