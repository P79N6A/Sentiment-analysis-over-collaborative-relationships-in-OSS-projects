    "body": "I say 2 but MAAAAAAYBE 3.\n\nThe theory is you have one for your main base, and another for a secondary base or you can try to basewalk with it but it will be actually risky since you only get 2 of them.  You cant just replace it instantly without sacreficing the safety of your only other MCV or waiting for another to build.\n\nSo you can still basewalk, but it will actually be potentially stoppable for the defending player. You could still have like more then 1 enemy player working together but unless its a shitty map like doubles that would leave openings to flank.\n\nThose fucking games where the attacking players have a seemingly endless supply of MCV's so you can't do shit about it are not fun. You use up most of your army to take out 1 MCV and 2 more have already taken its place.\n\nBONUS POINTS: You can't deploy 2 MCV's in the same build radius. Friendly players that is, enemy's should still be able to I guess to prevent lockout scenarios.\n"
