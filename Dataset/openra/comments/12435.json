    "body": "I can sadly confirm that i have seen this in both Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert. You dont even need to destroy all ways for the ai to get to you. Even with 3-4 none destroyable bridges and a relativly open map, the ai will go out of wack in about 10 min of playing, basically not finding the simple way to your base and just having its units stay in groups scattered through out the map and collect a huge ammount of slow and laggy gameplay until destroyed. Feels like the devs need to put prio on the ai/pathfinding, would be a shame to have it be this way for years to come :( "
