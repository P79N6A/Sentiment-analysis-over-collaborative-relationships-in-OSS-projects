There are several Actor commands (e.g. Kill(), Destroy()) that tend to do bad things if done to a Player, and you can't call player.Kill() anyway except through this loophole. \r\n\r\nIf a player (player 1) is subject to Destroy() through the method above, making a reference to a different player (e.g. player 2) will throw both a Lua error _and_ a crash (NullReferenceException as described above). The lua error will indicated that you tried to get a trait from 'player 1 (not in world)', even if the player you are referencing is player 2. \r\n\r\nIf there is a reason for including Player it would be good to hear it."
