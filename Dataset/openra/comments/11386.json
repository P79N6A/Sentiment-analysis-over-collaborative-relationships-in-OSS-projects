    "body": "I don't like the idea of just turning this off.\n\nA not-much-harder workaround that would look much better would be to fake the turn using spline interpolation:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_Catmull%E2%80%93Rom_spline\n\nhttps://github.com/pchote/star-simulator/blob/master/cloudgen.c#L85\n\n`p1` and `p2` are the start and end points of the move, and `p0` (at the start) and `p3` (at the end) can be found by adding a `WVec` to `p1` and `p2` in the direction of the movement into and out of the move.  The only tricky bit is to work out how long those vectors should be: For now you could assume a constant value (maybe half or a full cell), but for a more realistic behaviour we want to scale the length based on the inverse of the ROT.\n"
