This could also be changed relatively fast. The values of D2K will be multiplied by 10, bringing it in line with the other mods. I presume this is also wanted (looking at @MustaphaTR, as our main contributor for D2K, for conformation).\r\n\r\nI'll have this done well in time before Christmas.\r\n\r\nLast but not least is the TS mod.
