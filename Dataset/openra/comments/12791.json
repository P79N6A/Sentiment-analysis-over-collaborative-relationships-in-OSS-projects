Unfortunatelly this thing got rejected, for there was too much code conditions to add for the \"Spy\" actors. Unfortunatelly..."

    "body": ">Trying to make them more useful? I can't remember OpenRA being this way at any point.\r\n\r\n95% of the gameplay differences between WW Red Alert and OpenRA's Red Alert can be summed up as \"XY unit became more useful\" (great examples are the Thief->Hijacker and the ECM Radar Jammer changes). TBH I also don't see an issue with the current setup. I can imagine that the options should be added to the game (for map/modders) BUT I don't see the need of them having enabled in the RA mod. Also, keep in mind that the production-reveal logic conflicts with OpenRA RA gameplay (AFAIK for the reveal you need to select the infiltrated building, which you can't really do under fog, besides, some of them would be quite redundant anyway, say what's the point of seeing the resource amount when you're just stealing it anyway.)"

I participated in Ares development and I have already migrated my Ares-RA2 mod into OpenRA more-or-less. I can even tell you that while the RA1 infiltration logic was restored in Ares indeed, relatively early (IIRC 0.1/early-0.2 days) NOONE used it, because it didn't worked with PCX/custompaletted cameos until 0.9-0.A or around (And custompaletted cameos were a lot more useful, so much that infact my first OpenRA PR was to implement that feature)."
