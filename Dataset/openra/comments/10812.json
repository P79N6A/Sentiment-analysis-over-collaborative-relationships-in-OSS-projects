    "body": "So I searched online for information on this, and am now on probably many more lists than I already was =)\n\nThe closest thing to answering this question seems to be this: http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/109888.\n\nThe reasoning seems sound to me. There are four major effects to nuclear explosions (radiation, thermal, blast and EMP), and a big body of water provides protection against all of them (assuming the explosion is an air-burst). With a (sub-)surface burst, [anything within at least a mile will be gone](https://medium.com/war-is-boring/how-to-nuke-a-submarine-2f0bd50f39e#.bqaf7na3h).\n\nSo the current behaviour is ok from a simulation standpoint. If it is from a gameplay standpoint is another question. I suggest we focus on the second question.\n\nPersonally, I think changing the nuke to affect submerged subs would be reasonable. Targeting subs with nukes is a game of chance at best anyway, so I doubt such a shame would have any real consequences except in corner cases.\n"
