    "body": "The simple option is to change `ChronoshiftPower` to call (via `Chronoshiftable.CanChronoshiftTo`) `CanEnterCell` with `checkTransientActors: false`. This fixes the issue above, but this disables the red tiles for visible structures as well as invisible.  Manually checking against the `FrozenActorLayer` doesn't work because the frozen footprint includes pathable cells (i.e. bibs) as well as unpathable. There is then the nightmare of edge cases where the chronoshift logic teleports the unit to a different cell if there is a blocker in the desired cell. \r\n\r\nI suspect that it may not be possible to fix this at all without changing the behaviour of the support power. IMO the only viable solution here will be to remove the white/red overlay completely."
