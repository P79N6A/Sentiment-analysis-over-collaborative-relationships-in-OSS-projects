    "body": "Indeed, I messed that up. The keys in the list are accurately described as intervals as far as I can tell from looking at the code. The following keys could be renamed to use delay/duration:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAircraft\r\n  NumberOfTicksToVerifyAvailableAirport\r\n```\r\nApart form this I couldn't find any other notation in ticks that should be renamed.\r\n\r\nOne could rename those that are only called \"interval\" to something more specific like \"RepairInterval\" or \"DamageInterval\", however that's not the point of this issue. I made some proposals nevertheless:\r\n```\r\nRepairsUnits\r\n  Interval -> RepairInterval (unify with RepairableBuilding)\r\nBurns\r\n  Interval -> DamageInterval (unify with  DamagedByTerrain)\r\nCashTrickler\r\n  Interval -> CashInterval (specify)\r\nEnemyWatcher\r\n  NotificationInterval -> NotifyInterval (unify wit other occurrences)\r\nSeedsResource\r\n  Interval -> SeedingInterval (specify)\r\nWithIdleAnimation\r\n  Interval -> AnimationInterval (specify)\r\nAmbientSound\r\n  Interval -> SoundInterval (specify)\r\nAnnounceOnKill\r\n  Interval -> NotifyInterval (unify wit other occurrences)\r\n```\r\nI'm not really sure if the following do just update positions: \r\n```\r\nSmokeTrailWhenDamaged\r\n  Interval -> TrailUpdateInterval\r\nLeavesTrails\r\n  MovingInterval -> MovingTrailUpdateInterval\r\n  StationaryInterval -> StationaryTrailUpdateInterval\r\nProjectile\r\n  TrailInterval -> TrailUpdateInterval\r\n```\r\nEdit: Have a crappy internet connection atm so I see replies late, would agree with @reaperrr to close this."

    "body": "Yes, renames are always an inconvenience for modders, mostly for three reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst, that you have to rename all traits and properties on each mod to get it working again. (This has already been fixed with the latest upgrade rule change)\r\n\r\nSecond, Even tho the mod is going to update itself, the modder memory will not, the yaml user will not be able to remember all the changes of the properties and will use the old names, this will lead to frustration because **the game does not tell you that you are inputting a wrong property** , meaning they will do blank changes, that they wont be able to spot after doing atleast 3 or 4 tests. (AFAIK @Phrohdoh is partially fixing this issue with a plugin)\r\n\r\nThird, Modders cannot trust the upgrade rule completely, as its not something that can handle exceptions to the general rules, for example, on Shattered Paradise I have aircraft that dont need to rearm, after the ammunition fix, the Property ``PauseOnCondition: !ammo`` was applied to all my aircraft, which didnt do anything at first glance because SP comes from a time where you needed to give infinite ammo to aircraft to get this effect anyway, but weeks later, after doing some changes to the units, I started to wonder, why my unit only fires 5 shots when the burst says 10? Then I noticed.\r\n\r\nThe end result here is that, after each engine upgrade, we **have to** delay the patches atleast for a week to check if everything works as normal. Now, @pchote asked us to delay the release of Shattered Paradise until some performance fixes are merged upstream, so OpenRA gets a **good image as a first impression**, this is completely understandable, but you guys should understand we have the same problem when property names are changed, after a patch, a **bug is likely to slip through**, and that means new users can get the idea that the game is buggy, this is my fault for not checking, **yes it is**, but the real cause are **these renames**. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion here is to have something that checks for invalid properties, and if possible, make the mod crash when a trait has a wrong property (of course, this will need an exception that mentions where is the error) , on the other hand, fixing the traits page would be also very helpful, as it allows you to see the traits. I remember there was an utility command to print all the current traits, I will have to test it to elaborate further."
