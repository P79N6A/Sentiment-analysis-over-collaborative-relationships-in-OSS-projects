    "body": "25mm impact (no sound) and DepthCharge launch (no-sound) works as intended.\r\n\r\nAnother regression found with the  #12633 DepthCharge. Wasn't noticed at first, it's very subtle but in the release it has a sort of \"underwater-impact\" sound coupled with the explosion sound when the DepthCharge hits its target. When missing its target (submarines on the move) the water-impact sound plays by itself as intended. With direct hits the DepthCharge erroneously cancels out the water-impact sounds and only plays the explosion sound.\r\n\r\nEdit: I can't find anything more than that so besides the above, üëç "
