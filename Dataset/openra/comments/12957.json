    "body": "This idea has been suggested and rejected many times now.\r\n\r\nThe main issue always comes back to: What gameplay issue is this supposed to solve?  Adding units just \"because why not?\" is horrible game design.\r\n\r\n> Right now, the Soviets don't have a Hero unit \r\n\r\nThe factions are deliberately assymetric.  Why should the soviets have a hero unit?\r\n\r\n> the sprite work for Volkov is in the original game's files (or the expansions) so it wouldn't require a complete recreation from the ground up.\r\n\r\nVolkov was an expansion pack mission specific unit.  He didn't have his own artwork or rules, but instead was implemented with custom map rule overrides on the existing \"field marshal\" civilian.  The only reason that he is different to e.g. the Super Tanks in Monster Tank Madness is that he was used across more than one mission.\r\n\r\n> but, was ultimately cut despite still appearing on the cover art.\r\n\r\nThis \"fact\" was made up by the enthusiastic player community.  \"Dude with thing on his face\" is a common cover art theme across all the early games."

    "body": "I guess that logic could be used but, that didn't stop adding the Phase Tank, Flak Truck, Sniper, or the Supply Truck.\r\n\r\nAlso, even if he wasn't actually on the cover art, he would at least make more sense than adding zombies to the game. Considering you threw out the whole \"Add units because why not?\" logic. \r\nI never said, add him just because. I have my reasons. \r\n\r\nSure, the tech trees would still be asymmetrical (because Allied air units can attack Soviets air units but, not vice versa) but, at least make a Hero unit based on the existing character to fill the gap with something that fits the Soviet's vehicle based arsenal with an infantry unit that can take out vehicles like a sniper. Since Tanya can clean out infantry with virtually no issue, the Soviets should have an infantry that can clean out armor with little issue.\r\n\r\nI think nerfing him with a slower fire rate and removing his \"Tanya pistol\" would be a fair means to balancing him out.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "The Flak Truck and Supply Truck were added to fix specific gameplay problems.  The sniper was removed as a buildable unit precisely because it didn't have a useful role to justify its custom nature.\r\n\r\nI have heavily argued for removing the sniper and zombie artwork completely, and they only exist now because one of the other developers like them (for reasons that I can't understand).  Responses like yours demonstrate why keeping them is bad â€“ they have set a precident for adding things that really should not exist in OpenRA.  Still, that does not justify adding more."
