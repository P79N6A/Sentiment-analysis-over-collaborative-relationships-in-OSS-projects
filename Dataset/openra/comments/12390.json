    "body": "I’m concerned with what this will do to gameplay, especially with rocket soldiers vs Hinds. Will engaged rocket soldiers stop shooting their current target and address the air threat? Or will they be mowed down even with hinds in range and in the player’s field of vision? Maybe player skill will get to the point where players should be expected to target-fire hinds to stay alive, but I don’t know that we are there yet.\r\n\r\nAs for how it looks to have a rocket solider fire two missiles at the same time: This is a world with tesla death-rays and a crazy lady who out-ranges and massacres riflemen with dual .45s. Does it really matter where a guy with infinite ammo keeps his extra missile?\r\n"
