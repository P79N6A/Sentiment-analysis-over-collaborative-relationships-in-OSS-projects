    "body": "Very nice, I like it. One thing I'd like to see is support of allied players, ie. when an ally is under attack, send a squad to help him. The AI appears a bit selfish otherwise ;)\n\nIn the test game with four AIs that I observed, two minor issues with Tanya crates occurred, which ultimately led to the game not finishing. The first was that the enemy picked up a Tanya crate outside of the range of the defending players, but didn't do anything with her. The defenders never went outside of their base to look for her, so the game never ended. The other issue was that the defending AI picked up a Tanya crate itself, but also didn't know what to do with her, she just idled. The first issue really only was an issue, because all the players were AI.\n\nNone of those thing should hold off this PR from getting merged, though. :+1: \n"
