    "body": "@pchote Would an approach like this possibly be enough? https://github.com/reaperrr/OpenRA/tree/abstract-projectiles\n\nMaybe not as good as a new framework with modules, but presumably far less work (with my branch above we're ~90% there already) for good-enough gains.\n\nIt gets rid of `*Info` duplication / inconsistencies and removes several limitations at the same time.\n\nA few more aspects (like smoke trails) could probably be further un-duplicated by moving them to helper methods located on the abstract base projectile.\nThe only duplication would happen between beams and sprite projectiles, but that would only affect very few things (like blocking-related logic and muzzle flashes, once I add the latter), as they're quite different in nature anyway.\n"
