    "body": "@r34ch On that render I can see a minigun. I guess we shouldn't be fooled by renders.\n\nThe only counter to mass tesla tanks is air units. If you mix in some flak trucks, then there are no counters. What if we made the flak truck available only for Ukraine? It means that tesla tanks would be an easy target without protection. The only viable mobile protection would be rocket soldiers, and they're slow (so get an APC). So you can go for a ride with them, but it would be pretty risky (currently it's not risky because flak trucks are as fast).\n\nI'm not a fan of nerfing tesla tank at the moment simply because it's a high tech unit. You have to spend a lot of time and money to be able to build it. I wouldn't want to have a cheap Chinese zap-zap toy.\n\nIn terms of crushing abilities it's similar to the light tank from TD.\n"
