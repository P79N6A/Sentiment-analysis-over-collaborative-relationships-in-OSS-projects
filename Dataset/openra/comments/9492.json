    "body": "Ah ok. I never figured that out. Also I learned that you can switch between per-player views in teams by pressing the same team view button. Obviously it would be more convenient having the option with all-players/shroud-disabled (e.g. battles and quick turn of events) and make future casting more seamless. If it's not too much trouble I'd love to have the ticket open in hopes of someone having a stab at it.\n"
