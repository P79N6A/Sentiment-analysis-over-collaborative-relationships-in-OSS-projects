    "body": "There are some good ideas in here, but it will need some more discussion / development before somebody jumps into coding it.\n\nIn particular, you need to be careful about the two completely different things that the existing targeting code manages:\n1.  The positions that can be targeted on an actor.  Our handling of this is abysmal: we use the range to any targetable position while determining target ranges, but projectiles then go exclusively to the center position.  This causes our weapons to fail completely if their ranges is less than half the footprint size.\n2.  Target types, which have an all or nothing effect.\n\nWe should keep separate traits for (1), otherwise you are asking for pain around the edge cases: e.g. units can occupy 0, 1, or 2 cells at any given time, and its possible that the actor's center position is in a completely different cell versus buildings which should be attackable at any cell in their footprint.  I'm all for replacing our current mess of subclasses for (2) with some kind of setup that has a single 'manager' trait and some way for other traits to add or remove target types.\n"

    "body": "1. definitely need a fix, TS visceroids were serious melee threats buildings in a base, YR also had Brutes. I can also see why it should keep the sepearate traits.\n\nMaybe decoupling the actual TargetTypes from TargetableUnit/Building into a new properly upgradeable trait would be the way to go. Notsure, I'll definitely brainstorm over this.\n"
