I just watched an AI game as a spectator where one AI had a tech center, the satellite was deployed (didn't see it myself, but the countdown was gone), but there were no GPS dots. Not sure what happened there. The other AIs' GPS was working fine. Watching the replay now.\n\nEdit: The replay desynced.\n"
