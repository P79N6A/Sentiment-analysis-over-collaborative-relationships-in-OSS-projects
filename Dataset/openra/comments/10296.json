    "body": "Can you show the map, please? From the screenshot, it looks like there isn't any ore near the refinery, which is a situation known for creating huge latency issues in the harvesting code. If that's true for all of the map, it might well pose a problem.\n\nYour perf.log, however, shows that the Move activity causes most of the latency. Do your maps have separate islands, or land masses which are only connected by destroyed bridges, by any chance? The pathfinder doesn't really like that situation and the AI doesn't handle it properly either.\n"

I will add ore and gems to the map and then report back if it is still lagging.\n\n@pchote can there be seperate landmasses when the bridges are not destroyed?\n"
