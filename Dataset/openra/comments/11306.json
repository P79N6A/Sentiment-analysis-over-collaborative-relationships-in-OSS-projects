This will prevent the mission from being too easy (aka a-move the commando around the map killing basically all infantry without any difficulty).\n- As usually I derped at first and ran into the wrong direction, discovering the abandoned base first (without engineers and thus cash) and consequently failing the mission. Maybe we could use beacons to signalise on where the player is ought to go first? I don't know, maybe that is too much.\n"

I don't remember) sold my construction yard (after building a power plant and barracks, I had exactly enough money for that) like I had to do in the previous missions (although I already figured that I'm probably not supposed to sell it in this mission). With the new cash I trained the engineers. I guess that there is not really much we can do to prevent (stupid) people (like me) from doing that, except someone has a good idea...?\n\n> Not sure about the commando being able to destroy vehicles, I thought there was a reason why he can't do it in td.\n\nWe also only allow that in missions for tanya. And you're right, C4ing vehicles is still a little bit glitchy (as are hijackers). I'd vote for doing it in td as well, would be good to hear what @Mailaender and @obrakmann (maybe @pchote as well - I mean, he has an opinion on everything :p) think about it though.\n"
