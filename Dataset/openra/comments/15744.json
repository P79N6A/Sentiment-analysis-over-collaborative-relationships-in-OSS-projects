    "body": "I've been reluctant to add this before now because (1) it breaks the long-standing model that a cell should only be able to contain one structure at a time, and (2) `BuildingInfluence` is a very old abstraction that doesn't clearly reflect how it is now used, and therefore should be removed.\r\n\r\nIn the medium-term i'm hoping that #15876 plus a new interface generalizing buildable cells (also needed for #5931) will let us remove `BuildingInfluence`. In the short term I am okay in principle with merging this for the sake of kknd.\r\n\r\nWe should consider reverting #13796 and other `BuildingInfluence` workarounds as part of this.\r\nMaybe fixes #14676?"
