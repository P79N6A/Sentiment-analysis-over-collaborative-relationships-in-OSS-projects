    "body": "I _think_ Monster Tank Madness could be fixed by having an at-first unused player and then changing the owner of the mad tanks instead of using `SetStance`. Then `Player.SetStance` could be removed as well.\n\nCould you make the lobby check box placement between TD and the other mods consistent, please? In TD, Build Off Allied ConYards, Short Game and Crates are switched compared the other mods (I think I'd prefer TD's layout: 1st column visibility, 2nd column balancing, 3rd column misc.). My muscle memory will thank you :)\n"

    "body": "Diplomacy the way it's implemented now is broken beyond repair. It leads to asymmetric alliances, which causes all sorts of issues (chat, scoreboard, victory conditions etc.). While some interesting effects can be created using asymmetric alliances (Monster Tank Madness is one example), you just _cannot_ give players the tools to create such situations themselves.\n\nIt's also highly annoying when players switch allegiance mid-game.\n\nDoing it properly would involve adding a challenge-response mechanic. People would not be able to choose stances against individual players, but rather select a team and click on a \"join\" button. Then the remaining members of the parting team would need to authorize the player leaving their team, and all of the new team members would need to accept the request.\n\nThe only situation that I can come up with where such a feature would help would be, for example, a 3 vs 2 match where one player from the smaller team disconnected for whatever reason. then one player of the 3 player team could switch to turn it into a 2v2. I don't think that this situation arises often enough to warrant the effort required to write this feature, when the players could just as easily create a new game.\n"
