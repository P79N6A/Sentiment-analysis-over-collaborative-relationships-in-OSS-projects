    "body": "I appreciate the effort, but I don't think this should be merged in its current state.\n\n1) Not a major problem, but there seem to be a few typos.\n\n2) Most of the additions under sounds related to explosions, weapons and some other effects are only useful if you want to trigger a specific sound in a map without using a weapon/explosion, otherwise they're completely superflous because weapons, explosions etc. call the `.aud` files directly and don't use notifications.\n\n3) Another potential problem is that this contains all Firestorm speeches and sounds. To my knowledge, we're concentrating on vanilla TS initially, and if our content download/installation doesn't take this into consideration, it might result in crashes if expand01.mix and its content are missing and some mapper tries to add a sound because we had it defined in notifications.yaml. Additionally, this bloats the yaml with sound and speech definitions we currently don't need.\n\n4) This is simply too much for a single yaml, in my opinion. I'd at least split into `speech` and `sounds`, and then sub-split between `generic` and `singleplayer`, since - as mentioned above - most of these sounds and speeches will only be used in map triggers (if at all), and I dare to say those won't play much of a role for quite some time to come.\nSo we'd have `speech-generic.yaml` (containing mostly stuff that we already had), `speech-singleplayer.yaml` (containing most of the stuff added here), `sounds-generic.yaml` (containing mostly what we already had) and `sounds-singleplayer.yaml` (most of the added sounds).\nThis is just an example, but that's the minimum to keep things from becoming too messy, I think.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I'd prefer to add notifications only in moderation and when needed over this \"slap everything in\" approach. In my opinion, such a monster yaml would actually make things harder for us as long as the mod is still under development.\n"

    "body": "I agree with most of @reaperrr's comment. Explosions and other sound effects have no place in `notifications.yaml`, and our TS mod should not contain any FS assets.\nThat being said, I don't agree with the last part - not \"registering\" assets in mod YAMLs has lead to enough headaches in TD, RA and D2k. We should have everything available for when we need it, not make people have to go through the mix files searching for the 1 sound they need every time they need something new.\nAll TS voice notifications should be added here. Nothing more, nothing less. Splitting into separate YAML files might be good, so once we see how many all notifications are we can discuss that.\n"
