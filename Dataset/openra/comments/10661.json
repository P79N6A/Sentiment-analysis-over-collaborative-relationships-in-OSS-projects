    "body": "According to https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10&qpcustomd=0 it is showing that 52% is under Windows 7.\n\nAccording to http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey within the first month of January 32% show using Windows 7.\n\nGoing by http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_os.asp It shows a more detailed usage of the OS in category and in type.\n\nNews feed from softpedia at http://news.softpedia.com/news/windows-10-becomes-the-third-most-used-desktop-os-in-the-world-496203.shtml states that Windows 7 of novemeber last year is the most used OS. Windows 10 being the third most used.\n\nBack when Vista made its release no one wished to make the switch due to how buggy the system was. Particularly in the time that 64 bit was still a new technology and running 4gb of ram on windows XP was still enough.\n\nIt started to get to a point where people wanted more then 4gb due to advancements of video editing and other software designs which released windows XP 64 editions. However, Windows 7 was close on the rise so there were people who waited. (Estimated number whom waited I am unsure of)\n\nOnce windows 7 released the switch to 64 bit was clear as XP 32 was unable to utilize more then 4gb of ram. (Sometimes even 4gb itself and had to be 3.5gb) Which is why Windows 7 became so popular. Let alone for easy software usage.\n\nPersonal opinion: I think it is safe to make the switch to drop Windows XP. While it sucks all the same that Microsoft decided to do such as small companies still use XP. However, A lot of games coming out now and otherwise do not support XP. They instead support either Vista and above or Windows 7 and above. (Even some games no longer support Vista.)\n"
