    "body": "Originally I agreed with someone about the 5 min delay. But keeping track of the timeframes I agree with this here.\n\nIve actually removed the idea from my post and mentioned another idea to FiveAces and SoScared which is having an option for tournament crates. The original crates dont need to be edited. So the original crates can have things like spawning a visceroid (They want some love) or the old fashioned nuke crate (those were awesome).\n\nWhile tournament crates can go from 500-1000 money give and maybe giving an extra unit while having the 30-60 second delay factor. \n"

    "body": "RA you can still get MCV crates in the first few minutes of a game. Likewise a vehicle before you have a WF and dupe crates to boot. 5 enemy rangers on ore lord controlling most of the map LoS (and hence future crate drops) before you have even finished your WF? Invisibility for your starting APC on TD? (dunno if that one is still true to be fair)\n\nA timing fix only works on maps of a certain size. And also doesn't reward very early map control. But I guess since we have the 'enable crates' check-box this will most likely not get looked into unless more players kick up fuss.\n"
