    "body": "Best way to fix this would probably be to add a Where linq clause in SelectionDecorations.cs to filter out the IPips with a PipCount of 0, this would require adding a method / property to get that information from IPips.\r\n```pipSources = self.TraitsImplementing<IPips>().ToArray();``` ->\r\n```pipSources = self.TraitsImplementing<IPips>().Where(p -> p.PipCount()).ToArray();```\r\n\r\nEDIT: You could also not add the new method and just do a count on the IEnumerable that is returned by the method in IPips"
