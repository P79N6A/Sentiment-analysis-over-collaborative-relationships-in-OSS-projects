    "body": "wow sir cake, ty very much. I didnt expect any response anymore. anyway.\nabout your question. i edited the map so that everywhere where there is a\nriver, u can pass it either by boats AND with land units, so expansion is\nno problemo. i filtered out all river possibilities out where you can do\nthat and implemented them in the map. now that you fixed it i would love to\nhave the map send back to my email adress which is (runeavalon@gmail.com).\nI worked 6 months on this map to make it work like this. But the final goal\nof the map is to make it so that its as similar as possible to the main map\nof league of legends. I took the map of that game, made a screen shot of\nit, and copied all obstacles and pathways on the main land, and made it\nsimetrical for both top team and bottem team. And calculated the amount of\nore and travel time towards the ore from the main islands so that it is\nequal for both teams.\n\nNow to make it as similar as possible i really need someone who can do\nscripting. i hope you can and are up for the task. Maybe you know the game\nleague of legends and its main map \"summoner's rift\". And the playstyle of\nit. Else maybe you can take a look at youtube movies. There you can see\nthat there are 3 main \"lanes\" on which they fight. Each of them has a\ncertain \"team\" from which the outer lanes consist mostly of 2 members the\nmost right land usually is taken by 1 player and ends up in a 1 vs 1. mid\nlane is allways 1 vs 1. and the 5th usually can either choose to take part\nof the leftmost lane OR go in the jungle, where there are \"jungle creeps\"\nwhich you can kill and get money from. And bigger jungle creeps from which\nyou can get a bonus from.\n\nso to make it as similar as possible i added the turrets at the right spot\nwhich should start as an ally of those who belong to that particular lane.\nIn the jungle i cant remember what exactly i changed and which version of\nthe map you repaired. But i do know that i finished the path way right\nthrough the middle. In the real summoner's rift map of league of legends\nthat a river which you can walk through. I made it so that it looks a bit\nlike that. And i know that i placed a service depot on the 2 spots where\nthere should be a dragon in the original which gives you a sort of ultimate\nbonus. i put a mammoth tank on the service depot which should be edited so\nthat its extreeeeeeeemely powerfull in terms of attack rate and dmg and\nhealth. becouse in the original you can only defeat that dragon if you\nattack it with your whole team after your whole team is leveled up to a way\nstronger level than which they are starting at. in the Original summoner's\nrift you have places where there is grass in which you can hide so that the\nenemy can't see you. So i placed on all of those spots a gapgenerator which\nyou can take over by engineer. i also placed other neutral buildings in the\nmap. And the idea is that the turrets can be destroyed but they have to be\nmade way stronger, so that they can hold off an entire army. the\ngapgenerators should be indestructable, so that they can be taken over\nagain and again by either of the teams. then another thing that should be\nchanged is the other lesser bonus places. I was thinking about placing a\nbarrack there which can only build very strong units like upgraded zombies\nor ants. But u should only be given acces to it when you killed a couple of\nneutral creeps, and as soon as they are destroyed you should only be given\na limited time to build those upgraded units from the barrack behind it.\nAfter that the creeps should return and you can do it again but only if you\nkilled the creeps protecting it again. So building a base surrounding those\nplaces should be made impossible becouse red alert is a way different game\nthen league of legends xD. Then there is a concept in the game that from\nout the main base in league of legends creeps are released in intervals of\na sertain time period. Which follow the 3 lanes implemented in the map\nwhich are allies of your team. The enemy team can kill tho's for money.\nThey meet the enemy creeps in the middle if you dont intervene with them\nand they stay there to fight eachother. but the goal is to get to the enemy\nbase through all turrets and base defences and kill the enemy base core in\nthe original. Now i dont know if such a thing can be edited in the script\nso just killing all enemy opposition could also work and be fun. Since its\nred alert and not league of legends you can build boats, so therefore i\nadded a whole sea surrounding the level. and those boats are able to\npenetrate in the middle of the enemy base becouse of the fact that i made\nthe rivers so that you can either pass them by boat AND land units. so i\nadded also a couple of neutral creeps on the water which should simulate\npirate boats. All neutrall creeps in the entire level should attack\nanything from any team at sight.\n\nSo the question is which version of the map i made did you repair? Is there\nanything of the discribed above that i should change, becouse you maybe\nhave an older map version? and what are your capabilities of\nediting/scripting of all things i discribed above. I hope you can help me\nwith all the scripting part of the job. but you might want to give me the\nrepared map you have back to me on my email, as said above(\nruneavalon@gmail.com ). Also if you can give me your email adress i can\nsend it back to you as soon as all the base-objects are corrected again and\nchecked, so that you can do the scripting of all things allready there in\nthe map maybe.\n\nI think i leave it to this first becouse i notice this email has becoume\nvery long allready :/. i hope to hear a response from you soon. And thanks\nagain for repairing the map.\n\nCheers back to you, Leander Letwory (Ohmk Torque)\n\n2016-12-12 15:46 GMT+01:00 CH4Code <notifications@github.com>:\n\n> Hi Torque,\n>\n> i took a look at your map and unbugged it, so it can be edited in the map\n> editor again and be played (in theory).Map on resource center\n> <http://resource.openra.net/maps/17561/>.\n> I wanted to help you with this because its a huuuge map, and im sure it\n> took you lots and lots of time to tile this.

And the idea is that the turrets can be destroyed but they have to be\n> made way stronger, so that they can hold off an entire army. the\n> gapgenerators should be indestructable, so that they can be taken over\n> again and again by either of the teams. then another thing that should be\n> changed is the other lesser bonus places. I was thinking about placing a\n> barrack there which can only build very strong units like upgraded zombies\n> or ants. But u should only be given acces to it when you killed a couple of\n> neutral creeps, and as soon as they are destroyed you should only be given\n> a limited time to build those upgraded units from the barrack behind it.\n> After that the creeps should return and you can do it again but only if you\n> killed the creeps protecting it again. So building a base surrounding those\n> places should be made impossible becouse red alert is a way different game\n> then league of legends xD. Then there is a concept in the game that from\n> out the main base in league of legends creeps are released in intervals of\n> a sertain time period. Which follow the 3 lanes implemented in the map\n> which are allies of your team. The enemy team can kill tho's for money.\n> They meet the enemy creeps in the middle if you dont intervene with them\n> and they stay there to fight eachother. but the goal is to get to the enemy\n> base through all turrets and base defences and kill the enemy base core in\n> the original. Now i dont know if such a thing can be edited in the script\n> so just killing all enemy opposition could also work and be fun. Since its\n> red alert and not league of legends you can build boats, so therefore i\n> added a whole sea surrounding the level. and those boats are able to\n> penetrate in the middle of the enemy base becouse of the fact that i made\n> the rivers so that you can either pass them by boat AND land units. so i\n> added also a couple of neutral creeps on the water which should simulate\n> pirate boats. All neutrall creeps in the entire level should attack\n> anything from any team at sight.\n>\n> So the question is which version of the map i made did you repair? Is\n> there anything of the discribed above that i should change, becouse you\n> maybe have an older map version? and what are your capabilities of\n> editing/scripting of all things i discribed above. I hope you can help me\n> with all the scripting part of the job. but you might want to give me the\n> repared map you have back to me on my email, as said above(\n> runeavalon@gmail.com ). Also if you can give me your email adress i can\n> send it back to you as soon as all the base-objects are corrected again and\n> checked, so that you can do the scripting of all things allready there in\n> the map maybe.\n>\n> I think i leave it to this first becouse i notice this email has becoume\n> very long allready :/. i hope to hear a response from you soon.

I worked 6 months on this map to make it work\n>>>> like this. But the final goal of the map is to make it so that its as\n>>>> similar as possible to the main map of league of legends. I took the map of\n>>>> that game, made a screen shot of it, and copied all obstacles and pathways\n>>>> on the main land, and made it simetrical for both top team and bottem team.\n>>>> And calculated the amount of ore and travel time towards the ore from the\n>>>> main islands so that it is equal for both teams.\n>>>>\n>>>> Now to make it as similar as possible i really need someone who can do\n>>>> scripting. i hope you can and are up for the task. Maybe you know the game\n>>>> league of legends and its main map \"summoner's rift\". And the playstyle of\n>>>> it. Else maybe you can take a look at youtube movies. There you can see\n>>>> that there are 3 main \"lanes\" on which they fight. Each of them has a\n>>>> certain \"team\" from which the outer lanes consist mostly of 2 members the\n>>>> most right land usually is taken by 1 player and ends up in a 1 vs 1. mid\n>>>> lane is allways 1 vs 1. and the 5th usually can either choose to take part\n>>>> of the leftmost lane OR go in the jungle, where there are \"jungle creeps\"\n>>>> which you can kill and get money from. And bigger jungle creeps from which\n>>>> you can get a bonus from.\n>>>>\n>>>> so to make it as similar as possible i added the turrets at the right\n>>>> spot which should start as an ally of those who belong to that particular\n>>>> lane. In the jungle i cant remember what exactly i changed and which\n>>>> version of the map you repaired. But i do know that i finished the path way\n>>>> right through the middle. In the real summoner's rift map of league of\n>>>> legends that a river which you can walk through. I made it so that it looks\n>>>> a bit like that. And i know that i placed a service depot on the 2 spots\n>>>> where there should be a dragon in the original which gives you a sort of\n>>>> ultimate bonus. i put a mammoth tank on the service depot which should be\n>>>> edited so that its extreeeeeeeemely powerfull in terms of attack rate and\n>>>> dmg and health. becouse in the original you can only defeat that dragon if\n>>>> you attack it with your whole team after your whole team is leveled up to a\n>>>> way stronger level than which they are starting at. in the Original\n>>>> summoner's rift you have places where there is grass in which you can hide\n>>>> so that the enemy can't see you. So i placed on all of those spots a\n>>>> gapgenerator which you can take over by engineer. i also placed other\n>>>> neutral buildings in the map. And the idea is that the turrets can be\n>>>> destroyed but they have to be made way stronger, so that they can hold off\n>>>> an entire army. the gapgenerators should be indestructable, so that they\n>>>> can be taken over again and again by either of the teams. then another\n>>>> thing that should be changed is the other lesser bonus places. I was\n>>>> thinking about placing a barrack there which can only build very strong\n>>>> units like upgraded zombies or ants. But u should only be given acces to it\n>>>> when you killed a couple of neutral creeps, and as soon as they are\n>>>> destroyed you should only be given a limited time to build those upgraded\n>>>> units from the barrack behind it. After that the creeps should return and\n>>>> you can do it again but only if you killed the creeps protecting it again.\n>>>> So building a base surrounding those places should be made impossible\n>>>> becouse red alert is a way different game then league of legends xD. Then\n>>>> there is a concept in the game that from out the main base in league of\n>>>> legends creeps are released in intervals of a sertain time period. Which\n>>>> follow the 3 lanes implemented in the map which are allies of your team.\n>>>> The enemy team can kill tho's for money. They meet the enemy creeps in the\n>>>> middle if you dont intervene with them and they stay there to fight\n>>>> eachother. but the goal is to get to the enemy base through all turrets and\n>>>> base defences and kill the enemy base core in the original. Now i dont know\n>>>> if such a thing can be edited in the script so just killing all enemy\n>>>> opposition could also work and be fun. Since its red alert and not league\n>>>> of legends you can build boats, so therefore i added a whole sea\n>>>> surrounding the level. and those boats are able to penetrate in the middle\n>>>> of the enemy base becouse of the fact that i made the rivers so that you\n>>>> can either pass them by boat AND land units. so i added also a couple of\n>>>> neutral creeps on the water which should simulate pirate boats.

In the jungle i cant remember what exactly i changed and which\n>>>>>> version of the map you repaired. But i do know that i finished the path way\n>>>>>> right through the middle. In the real summoner's rift map of league of\n>>>>>> legends that a river which you can walk through. I made it so that it looks\n>>>>>> a bit like that. And i know that i placed a service depot on the 2 spots\n>>>>>> where there should be a dragon in the original which gives you a sort of\n>>>>>> ultimate bonus. i put a mammoth tank on the service depot which should be\n>>>>>> edited so that its extreeeeeeeemely powerfull in terms of attack rate and\n>>>>>> dmg and health. becouse in the original you can only defeat that dragon if\n>>>>>> you attack it with your whole team after your whole team is leveled up to a\n>>>>>> way stronger level than which they are starting at. in the Original\n>>>>>> summoner's rift you have places where there is grass in which you can hide\n>>>>>> so that the enemy can't see you.

They meet the enemy creeps in the\n>>>>>> middle if you dont intervene with them and they stay there to fight\n>>>>>> eachother. but the goal is to get to the enemy base through all turrets and\n>>>>>> base defences and kill the enemy base core in the original. Now i dont know\n>>>>>> if such a thing can be edited in the script so just killing all enemy\n>>>>>> opposition could also work and be fun. Since its red alert and not league\n>>>>>> of legends you can build boats, so therefore i added a whole sea\n>>>>>> surrounding the level. and those boats are able to penetrate in the middle\n>>>>>> of the enemy base becouse of the fact that i made the rivers so that you\n>>>>>> can either pass them by boat AND land units. so i added also a couple of\n>>>>>> neutral creeps on the water which should simulate pirate boats.

I made it\npossible for soviets to acces all oil derrecks, i fixed stat defence\nplacement. as far as i know you can access now every location either by\nboat or by land units.\n\nfor the question about harvesting and building space near the orepatches:\nIt is first of all ment to have infinite ore, BUT you need a lot of\nharvesters. It is possible for 1 person to build a conyard at the patch\nplaces left and right. And i made just enough room for 1 or 2 refinaries\nthere. The starting cash comes from the most upper and most lower ore\npatches.\n\nThen after that it is ment to expand as soon as possible towards the 3 mid\nspots( left middle and right) where both teams can fight for the 1 ore\npatch that is there on each of the 3 lanes.\n\nThen it is also ment to gain money out of killing creeps which have to\nrespawn after a certain amount of time after being killed as i explained in\nmy way too long message above.\n\nShall i upload the map with the changes? or shall i send it to your email\nadress? that is if these messages werent too long for you :/ and you are\nstill willing to help me out with this\n\ncheers Ohmk Torque\n\n2016-12-12 21:53 GMT+01:00 Leander Letwory <runeavalon@gmail.com>:\n\n> i just got a bit overexited,,,,,mannnnnnnnnn -_-\n>\n> 2016-12-12 21:53 GMT+01:00 Leander Letwory <runeavalon@gmail.com>:\n>\n>> Ahhhhhhh you responded!!!!!! i know i know.
