I don't tried to upgrading/downgrading drivers. Reboot haven't any effect.\n    Yes, it looks like just in the screenshot. This screenshot of the playtest version (20160403) in stable release and in the 20150614 i had this problem too, but only on big maps (bigger than or equal to 160x160). And i hadn't this problems in releases, which is older than 20150614.\n    There is no difference between window/fullscreen mode.\nPS: Reinstall of the game has no effect.\n"
