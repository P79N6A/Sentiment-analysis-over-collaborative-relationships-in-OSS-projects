    "body": "This is already possible. See the `GameOverDelay` property of the [`MissionObjectives`](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Traits#missionobjectives) trait. It does exactly what you're asking for, and has existed for over a year. You can set it yourself in custom maps. There's an upper limit of 2147483647, which corresponds to a bit more than 24 days, which will probably be enough.\n\nThe current delay of 1.5 seconds is used to keep sound effects from overlapping with the end game video. It is unlikely that that will be changed in shipped mods.\n"
