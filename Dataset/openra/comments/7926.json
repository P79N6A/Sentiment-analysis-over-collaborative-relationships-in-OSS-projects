    "body": "Some findings from a little debugging this morning:\n1. When the SAM site is tracking a target:\n   `AttackPopupTurreted` inherits from `AttackTurreted` which in turn inherits from `AttackFollow`. The SAM site will close if the `idleTicks` counter crosses a threshold. The counter is reset to 0 every time `AttackPopupTurreted.CanAttack` runs, which happens every tick because it's called in `AttackFollow.Tick`, so the counter never gets higher than 1.\n2. When the SAM site is idle:\n   The state tracking doesn't work properly. The only state that will make the SAM turn into the direction where the close animation can start is `PopupState.Open`. However, somehow it never gets out of the `PopupState.Rotating` state. Also the `turreted.DesiredFacing` value is reset to null somewhere along the way, so the turret never turns.\n"
