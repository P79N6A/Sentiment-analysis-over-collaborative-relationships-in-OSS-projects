    "body": "@HenrytheSlav I was thinking about that, but wouldn't that be CPU-intensive?\n\nYou'd need to calculate the distance every time a unit makes a sound. Also, where is the person listening located? If you take the center of the camera you might not hear your units getting attacked on the other side of the map (would be an interesting gameplay mechanic though). If every actor is listening, you have to calculate a lot more distances.\n\nOr maybe have a second, smaller, invisible (\"sound-\")shroud where units don't make the sound?\n"
