    "body": "I don't see how \"slowing-down the unit if the order is a crush order\" would be good at all - such an effect would make no difference if I start microing out infantry crushes by ordering the crusher to move to the cell beyond the infantry from the crusher's POV. Something one has to do in RA2 because that one has this as a locomotor bug, actually.\r\n\r\nMy opinion on this is that slowing down these fast units when they hit the first infantry would be the best way to resolve this because that wouldn't act erratic."

    "body": "Thats essentially the point.\r\n\r\nWhen a fast unit doesn't get slowed down upon crushing a unit they crush more effectively. These units that do cell to cell turns crush entire packs of 5 easily and units that transition to a new cell do not roll the RNG of dodge chance because they are on the move.\r\n\r\nSo the unit that makes contact with the first set of infantry that has this trait can slow down a bit which at least gives the infantry a chance to dodge.\r\n\r\nMy fault for not explaining it well.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that could be a problem is I don't know if the trait could have a speed setting on it. One speed may work on other units but another speed may not work on the other unit."
