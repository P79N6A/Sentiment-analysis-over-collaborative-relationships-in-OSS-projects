    "body": "I haven't finished testing this yet, but one thing that immediately caught my attention:\r\n\r\nEven on 'Easy', the start is ridiculously harsh even compared to the original's 'Hard' (which I watched on youtube).\r\n2 out of the 4 minigunners escorting the retreating truck were retreating with it in the original, and the minigunner from the north and grendiers from the south would arrive *much* later, giving you enough time to kill the 2 remaining escort minigunners first.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: In all 3 attempts on Easy so far, my minigunners and spy got killed quickly with at least 4-5 enemy soldiers left, with the north minigunner then later also killing one and wounding another e3 from the 2nd wave as well, because I couldn't build a barracks and kill the enemies off that fast.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, at least on 'Easy' the start should not be harder than in the original's 'Hard', meaning a) 2 of the 4 escort minigunners should run away or at least stay away far enough to not attack, and b) both the minigunner from north and grenadiers from south should arrive at least some 15-20 seconds later (and preferrably not at the same time, either), instead of all enemies from all directions coming in at once. That way, even slower players like me should be able to at least save the spy and kill more of the attackers."
