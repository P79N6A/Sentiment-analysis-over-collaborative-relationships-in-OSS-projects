    "body": "This is a side-effect of using the legacy GL \"wide line\" support.  Another limitation is that there is a driver-specific limit to the width the lines can be drawn.\n\nWe need to replace this with our own DIY line rendering using colored polygons, which also improves our compatibility with newer GL versions (including ES) that have dropped support for this feature.\n"
