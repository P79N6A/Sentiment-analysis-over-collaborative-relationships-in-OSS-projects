    "body": "The most noteworthy point, I think, is:\n- The Production\\* traits get support for producing a collection of actors, instead of only the one. This functionality will be utilized in the follow-up PR.\n\nOther important points are:\n- The TD Nod delivery plane's behavior now matches the original game in the cases where there is no space to drop a new unit.\n- In both TD and D2k the delivery actors will wait until all cargo is unloaded, as opposed to dropping everything off immediately on touchdown and taking off again.\n\nSmall fries:\n- As a side bonus, D2k uses one less trait from `OpenRA.Mods.Cnc`.\n- There was a bit of Production\\* trait reordering (added a new `Traits\\Production\\` folder).\n- Some cosmetic fixes to `Production` and `ProductionFromMapEdge`.\n\n**Note: the original idea of this PR was to have no changes visible ingame.** This has changed with the changing of the TD delivery plane's behaviour, but should be contained to that and the delivering actors waiting to unload. This PR is still mostly trait refactoring to enable the actual behavior changes.\n"

The general approach I have suggested will not affect the behaviour for regular gameplay, and in all but the most extreme case (1 cell map cordon, airstrip placed on the very left hand side of the map, very fast aircraft) would add the actors to the C17 before it gets anywhere near the playable world.\n\nOf course, you don't need to add them to the plane thats already created.  You could equally well hold them in a queue and add everything to the next plane that is created after a suitable delay (which is closer to how D2K is likely to do this).\n"

    "body": "I've noticed a couple of things:\n- The waiting-for-delivery animation never gets stopped after delivery (`INotifyDelivery.Delivered` never called).\n- When selling or destroying the starport (probably the nod airstrip, too) after a successful call to `TryToLand`, but before `MakeDelivery` gets called and `landedActor` set, the delivery aircraft lands and unloads instead of immediately taking off again (since `landedActor == null`, `TakeOff` never gets called in `Killed` and `Selling`).\n- When all exits from the starport (pbbly also airstrip) are blocked, every new order gets paid for, but automatically ignored (`production`cleared in `StartDelivery`). This also leaks money in case of `production` not being empty when an unloading deliverer takes off (probably only a debug case).\n- In extreme debug cases (ordering so that deliverers come at the current `MinimumInterval` of 75), two delivery aircraft are allowed to land and unload simultaneously, making four tanks appear on two cells simultaneously (the second deliverer has `GetAvailableExit` called before the first one has fully landed and started unloading and thus started to block exits). Nothing crashes tho.\n"
