(other then for showing off) \n\nthis and the fact that gates were actually introduced in Tiberian Sun ... i think we should leave the \"surprise\" for this feature on our Tiberian Sun-mod (this is just my own personal oppinion) ... \n*what i mean by that is ... when i play TS ... i would actuallly like to play something else other then RA/TD or D2K ... features like the gates ... make Tiberian Sun \"different\" and \"new\" for me \n\n:-1: \n"

Gates are also usable in most maps, in my case they are more usable because almost all of my maps includes an army base. Props are props, using them is left to mapper if we add them mappers can find a usage don't worry about it.\n"

As a workaround @ScottNZ built a barrier with sand bags and infantry moving aside at that time.\n\nBut if getting even such simple dependencies merged, I doubt I will want to go through the pain of contributing a complex Lua scripted remake here. The `CHANGES REQUESTED` button or derail a pull request with FUD have become an instrument to enforce a very strict way how things have to be done, which limits the ideas and creative freedom of individual contributors.\n\nEverybody seems to have an opinion on this, but I expect that very few people have actually downloaded this branch, tried it out and gave some hints on how to improve it, which is the only thing I ask for when submitting something for review.

Please leave that to the chat room or the discussion forums.\n\nThe primary purpose of a PR is to evaluate a set of changes for inclusion.  The very first point that needs to be established is \"do we want this\": discussion about how the feature integrates with the rest of the project is _essential_ for this.  Most technical issues with a feature can be fixed if the feature is wanted, but I don't see much point spending time commenting on technical issues if it doesn't pass the initial smell test.\n\nI find it difficult to read the dismissal of the integration discussion as anything other than \"if it works then you should merge it – I don't care how this affects the game, merge it now and _you_ can sort out the details later\".\n"
