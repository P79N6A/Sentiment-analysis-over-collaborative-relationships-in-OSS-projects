Again, no direct contribution. People who add a \"comma or a period\" still end up with a direct contribution. While I agree that there should be a minimum amount of PRs/patches sent before expanding the AUTHORS, but if I follow your logic, Umair Azfar Khan aka umairazfar aka Crossfire mod owner would've been listed for years now due to the fact he  added dozens of tutorials in 2013-2014 (with a lot of them had to be hidden due to being too outdated for nowadays use). But his name is missing."
