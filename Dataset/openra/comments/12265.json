    "body": "The replay \"100%\" point is based on the number of net ticks, so this counts all the real time spent after the game is complete (chatting, etc).  When replaying these end-game ticks are simulated all at once, causing the jump from the final percentage (< 100%) up to 100%.\n\nTo fix this `World.EndGame` should write the game tick into the replay game info (refer to `World.OnPlayerWinStateChanged` to see how), the replay connection should load and expose this, and then the ingame replay UI should use this and the local tick count instead of `TickCount` and the `NetFrameNumber`.\n"
