    "body": "Planes returning to base when idle is standard C&C behaviour.\r\n\r\nI've found it kind of sad to watch the \"helicopterization\" of planes in the RA mod over the last couple of years: the original gameplay plan was that helicopters (tanky but slow) lived on the battlefield except when they returned to resupply, while planes (fast but very fragile) stayed on the airfield except when they were on a strike mission.  This made picking soviet vs allied for their aircraft a meaningful strategic choice.\r\n\r\nIf you want the soviets to have an aircraft that behaves like a helicopter, then give them back the hind :smile:"

    "body": "PR #13242\r\n\r\nMIG, YAK in RA and ORCAB, SCRIN in TS are the only aircraft that return to base on idle and it is wrong IMO. In game you move your planes to point A. When they reach it they fly in circle there. You can return them anytime to base by F key. When they are moving to point A and before they reach it, you press S to stop them sooner and you expect they will stay there. Thanks to this issue I realized that while playing I can't press S, but I have to use Move order on the current plane position so they stay there, however you can stop Helis by S.\r\n\r\nThe fix is simple - Replaced ReturnOnIdle (in RA only atm) by FlyCirleOnIdle trait (FlyCirle activity) - the same activity used by Move order when they reach destination. ReturnOnIdle seems useless, because planes are ordered explicitly to return on \"RetunToBase\"(F key) or out of ammo, they don't return based on ReturnOnIdle trait. It was used only on a Cancel order (like Stop) where in fact it is wrong."
