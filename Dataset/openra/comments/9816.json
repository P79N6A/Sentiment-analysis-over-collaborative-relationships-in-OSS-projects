    "body": "Unfortunately that just uploaded an image of the icon, and not the log file itself, but I can make an educated guess: OpenRA itself still supports 10.6.8 (but no earlier), but many other software packages don't including newer versions of mono. Brew cask installs mono 4.0.4 as a dependency, which I expect will be crashing during startup.  Try installing version 3.4 or 3.2.8 from http://download.mono-project.com/archive/ instead.\n"
