I removed them to avoid more confusion.\r\n\r\nIn [release-20161019](http://www.openra.net/news/release-20161019/) we had to change the way that assets were installed to support the different package layouts used by the digital releases.  Some mix files are still directly copied, but others (like the movie mixes) must be extracted â€“ and the list of what must be copied vs extracted depends on where you are copying the assets from.\r\n\r\nWhile it is indeed still technically possible to manually install the french assets they are likely to cause problems with future releases, so do it at your own risk and if you encounter any bugs ingame then please be clear in any bug reports that you're using custom assets."
