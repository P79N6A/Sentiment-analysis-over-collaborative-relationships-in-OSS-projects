That would just have kept the discussion going, cause if i want someone to remove my name, all i need to do is to tell the responsible people to do it, and its their responsibility to do so. If he would made a pr, it it would still have to be accepted, which clearly shows thats not himself who could delete it, but the project owners. So there is no need to keep discussions going like \"oh, we have your deletion request, but  hey, get active and do another delete request via pr\" as the answer is sadly simple: he made the request to the project owners, now they have to do it."
