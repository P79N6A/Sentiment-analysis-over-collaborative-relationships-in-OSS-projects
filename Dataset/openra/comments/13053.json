    "body": "Looks great!\r\n\r\nA couple of ideas so that icons are grouped a bit closer to the tech progression (before radar, after radar, tech center):\r\n* Switch GDI medic and Jumpjet.\r\n* Switch GDI hover mrls and amphib. apc.\r\n* Cycle Nod sensor array to where the artillery is (to match GDI), then artillery to where sapc is, and sapc to where the sensory array is.\r\n\r\nAnother inconsistency I just noticed, not direct related to this PR, is that the Waste Refinery (on the buildings tab) depends on the Missile Silo (on the support tab), which feels wrong.  We may want to move that to the support tab too?  Maybe the stealth generator too."
