You have modding skills and (more importantly) you're one of the few people who holds community together by hosting streams where good players are willing to actually discuss gameplay issues (and more). \r\n\r\nI think playtests (I'm talking about OpenRa release type not your playtesting sessions) have often shown that most players don't feel like playtesting all that much and that the devs don't feel like playing (please, no offense to the ones who do).\r\nWhile the community is getting bigger I feel you're still in a rather unique position. And this is a praise to your commitment.\r\n\r\nI understand and respect your answer and I am not trying to change your mind or get a further explanation, I'm just pointing out **my hunch** that this might not happen naturally. \r\n\r\n**Everyone:\r\nHow about re-introducing this feature in the next playtests (after the upcoming release) to \"expose / push\" the issue some more to a greater number of players?**\r\n\r\n "

I do realize my current role in the community permeating a good chunk of the direction of the RA mod but know that I, with few exceptions, do not involve myself in any matter that does not personally interest me. Part of my interest to involve other viewpoints, solutions you could say would be in accordance with my interest to see the game grow but at the end of the day I won't delude anyone to believe that I do not ultimately represent myself and my own interests. As for the issue above, I don't feel strongly for or against it (with exception for it being part of the next release cycle) but I know there are others out there that has this as a high priority. I believe part of the open source process involves the risk of popular issues not being brought forward."
