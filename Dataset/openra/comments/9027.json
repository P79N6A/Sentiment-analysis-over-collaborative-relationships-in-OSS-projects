    "body": "As part of #12554 we have changed our server connection scheme from `openra://` to `openra-<mod>-<version>://` to encode the specific OpenRA version to launch.  We can similarly define the scheme here as `openra-map-<mod>-<version>://<path to oramap>` to select the specific OpenRA install to use, and the game/mod then knows its preferred location for custom maps.\r\n\r\nThe resource center can then display \"Install for &lt;version&gt;\" links for all the OpenRA versions that the map passes lint on."
