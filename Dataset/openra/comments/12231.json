Why the h*ll would you set gpu_mem to 512MB? :P That would STARVE the rest of the system, and forcing it to swap to a SLOOOOW SD card :') I'd bet big bucks that lowering the resolution to something like 1366x768, 1280x720 or even 720x480, and limiting GPU RAM to max 64MB would boost the performance a lot... If it needs a lot of RAM, maybe use a faster storage device than the SD card for swap. Try an old SSD on an USB2SATA interface"

It just about maxes the CPU, and even freezes completely for ~1 second every now and then...\r\n\r\nThere's clearly something terribly wrong in the codebase.\r\n\r\nThe original game ran VERY well on an i486DX2@66Mhz with 16MBs of RAM and a 1MB VGA card... If this re-make was done well, even a pi2 should NOT have any problems running it since that has around 50 times the CPU power, and 64 times the amount of RAM of said i486 machine."

There's a minor visible lag, but it's so small that it doesn't ruin the game experience - no freezes and no frame drops. The framerate occasionally drops to 26-28, but normally it's between 30-34 FPS.\r\n\r\nI use an SSD (Samsung 850 Pro 256GB), so that certainly helps, but the CPU and GPU are clearly enough for the game's requirements. Running in full screen at 1280x800, the CPU usage goes up to 45-50%, which is great for this PC, considering I have around 10% CPU usage before I start the game. Your hardware is a monster compared to my old laptop, so the issue you encountered obviously doesn't affect everyone and it would help if you'd run a few tests and share more details with the developers.\r\n\r\nP.S. My OS is Linux Mint 19.1 64-bit, Cinnamon."
