    "body": "I’m going to disagree on this one from the perspective of a player.\r\n\r\nIt’s entirely the job of the player to micro actors to ensure they are attacking the correct targets and to re-position them if necessary. If an opponent puts a wall in front of me it’s on me to find a way around it or through it.\r\n\r\nWalls work both ways. If my rifles move to flank a wall because they want to get at a pillbox they’re going to get shredded. There’s nothing more annoying as a player than units taking actions I don’t want them to take.\r\n\r\nActors also shouldn't pick a new target in face of the wall because this would primarily aid static defense over infantry, especially pillboxes. Walls in the competitive scene (well they're pretty much only used by OMnom), are typically placed in-front of enemy pillboxes and flametowers to counter the base crawl. I feel as a player, it should be on me to micro the pillbox to hit infantry that aren't blocked by the wall. A pillbox automatically taking out targets in that situation would be too much of a crutch.\r\n\r\nAs for the submarines mentioned in one of the tickets, perhaps they shouldn't surface and shoot until a clear path presents itself."

    "body": "Such a switch, if implemented, would be at the trait/mod level rather than something user facing.\r\n\r\nTS (and i'm sure the later games) repathed to avoid cliff blockers, so not implementing this would be a gameplay bug in addition to being annoying.  The AI would benefit from the actor blocker detection in all mods.\r\n\r\nI suspect that TS used the same criteria as for visibility, so that gives us an even easier height check that *could* be done before firing."
