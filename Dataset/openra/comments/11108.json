You also ignored/missed my sources of frustrations, namely camera and beacon support.\n\nThe charge issue could probably be solvedif you shift charging to the armament itself then take my `INotfyFiredSalvo` interface idea to stop your weapon. I actually really like that you could get this working without that terrible armament-interfacing I had to go with.\n"

TBH, I'm fine with lacking camera/beacons atm, but rendering the armament ranges during activation and the interface addition are something I'd strongly request there, because these should be relatively easy compared to beacon/camera which still makes me unghhh, due to missiles cannot be estimated properly. I do favor your method of implementation over mine, but I will still request to reach the same level of polish where I've got with it. :P\n"
