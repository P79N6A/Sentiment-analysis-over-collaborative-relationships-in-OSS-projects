    "body": "@pi99y : what i mean by fixing it , is ... we should add the \"running frames\" which we currently dont use ... aka. he has a normal speed for scouting ... and as soon as he sees a enemy \"starts running\" and then he makes a 1 cell jump ... this ends up \"tearing apart\" the enemy (which gives him a break , so he cant just jump to the next enemy\n\nit would probably not improve his effectivness ... but i think we should first of all add all the frames he is using in the original , and work from there , i personally wouldnt see the \"Dog\" as serious unit for scouting and killing , more as a soviet cosmetic ... specialized in detecting spys and disabling em\n"
