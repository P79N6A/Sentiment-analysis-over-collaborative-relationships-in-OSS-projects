Hearing stealth tanks and knowing a temple exists applies to com center tech in which seeing medium tanks/light tanks is a give away that the person has gone com tech.\r\n\r\nThe difference is you still need to scout those tanks, they dont make a global sound.\r\n\r\n>  It helps let the player know that stealthers are now on the map and start thinking of a counter.\r\n\r\nThen every unit should have a global sound so that people can make a counter.\r\nRight now, discerning which Nods vehicles are being made requires little to no scouting from the opponent, depending on the map. This in turn allows players to allows know what tech level a Nod player is at. Finding the temple is only a problem 5 minutes after its been made. This is why I usually wait a few minutes before making stealth tanks.\r\n\r\n> IMO this should apply to all sounds, not just cloak. It doesn't make sense that you can hear battles that are happening on the other side of the map from where your units are.\r\n\r\nI also agree with this however, as was discussed, i think it needs to be either around the edge of the shroud or based on whether a shot lands inside active vision so that you can here artillery or bikes shooting your harvester under shroud\r\n"

This also goes with commandos.\r\n\r\nNod vehicles are still unscouted despite spotting the planes. Despite of this GDI factions lose heavily to Nod as it is of this current release and will depend on how the roles play in the playtest/next release. Stealth Tanks are extremely powerful and outrange a lot of vehicles to help combat head on fights.\r\n\r\nSilencing the first built unit changes the gameplay completely to a point where you can have them idle with very little to not detection scouted. If you at least have the idea that they were built spreading of infantry or structures made to detect can be best utilized.\r\n\r\nSilencing the sound will also give some paranoid reactions in which you never know if they are even built in the first place. SCBW is a prime example of even seeing the stealth units without a revealing mechanic done to allow time to come up with a counter."
