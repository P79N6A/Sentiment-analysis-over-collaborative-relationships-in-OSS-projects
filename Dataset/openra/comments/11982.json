    "body": "> Isn't that wanted behaviour? (To e.g. have helicopters stay at the ground for repairs.)\n\nIn my opinion the wanted behaviour should be that the aircraft continues reloading as long as it is on the helipad/airfield, and only other queued activities like taking off afterwards should be canceled. \nHaving to manually order it to take off and land again to resume reloading just because you pressed 'S' to prevent it from doing something else is a bug to me.\n"

    "body": "I guess this would be possible (going from memory of the code here), but rather ugly. The `Cancel()` method in the `ResupplyAircraft` activity would need to be overridden so that it doesn't cancel itself, but just sets `NextActivity` to null, and also sets the `NextActivity` of the inner activity that is the last returned from `GetResupplyActivities()`  (for aircraft) or the Takeoff activity (for helis) to null.\n\nI think I'd be opposed to doing that for the ugly code involved alone.\n\nA better solution might be to make the `ReturnToBase` order check whether we're already on the ground and then just queueing only the resupply activities (+ Takeoff for helis). That difference in behaviour is a major pain in the rear, btw.\n"

They should not be full throttle on the ground.\n\nHelos should remain IDLE until given another order after rearming, unless the player has explicitly ordered a force attack/attack move, which already was the behavior.\n\nHelos haven't chased a target after a reload in any version of command and conquer. This is not StarCraft where your flying units do not need to rearm. Now they are suicidal and nearly un-repairable. This entire set of changes is a regression.\n"
