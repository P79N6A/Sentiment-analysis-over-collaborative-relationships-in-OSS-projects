    "body": "I'd like to add what may be a separate bug. Recently, in a game with about 7 hinds and 3 open helipads, my hinds were only able to use one helipad to reload. With individual hinds selected, the two other open helipads would display a \"cannot enter\" cursor (a red slashed circle around the green triangles). I had to individually micro each hind to use the single non-bugged helipad, costing me a lot of time.\n\nWill test this out / screenshot if I see it again.\n"
