We have DeployToUpgrade to somewhat resolve this, but there are valid cases for Transforms.\n[01:42:23]  <Phrohdoh> Correct, the new actor would have to alert the ones targeting the old one that it changed, and afaik we don't have anywhere to store that data.\n[01:42:26]  <Phrohdoh> (the list of attackers) \n```\n"

    "body": "While the undeploy and deploy bug resets the attacks on the structure there might be one solution to fix this involving C4 deployments. (Tanyas, Commandos). Slow the deployment animation down just enough where the C4 would still explode. This makes the two units deadlier rather then \"Well I can't C4 the conyard because it will just undeploy and deploy again.\" Also benefits the risk factor of \"I can take out some of the production or risk it for the conyard. Hmm.\"\n\nThe animation slow down would be just enough where Tanya/Commando starts the walk animation onto the center of the conyard and having to walk back again.\n"

Probably not easy, but not impossible to fix."
