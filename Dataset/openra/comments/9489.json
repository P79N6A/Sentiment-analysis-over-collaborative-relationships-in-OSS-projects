    "body": "Hmm. I just made the yaks in soviet01 hunt after spawning, and they just RTB after the first kill. Not quite sure what happens there. I suspect their activity queue gets cleared at some point and then `ReturnOnIdle` triggers, but I haven't found yet where it happens.\n\n(Later) Yep, removing `ReturnOnIdle` triggers the mid-air suspension.\n\nHelicopters don't have `ReturnOnIdle`, but their activity queue stills gets cleared, so they still don't really hunt. Guess this isn't as easy as I thought.\n"
