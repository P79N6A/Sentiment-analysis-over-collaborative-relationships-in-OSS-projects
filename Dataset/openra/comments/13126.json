This is a topic that we have not yet given serious thought to.\r\n\r\nFor this PR specifically, looking at https://github.com/forcecore/yupgi_alert0/pull/87 I would expect `AIDeployHelper` to call `ResolveOrder` instead of reaching directly into the internals of `DeployToUpgrade`, and `EnterSpawner` should be working with info passed into the virtual methods (which may require some changes to the method signatures).\r\n\r\nThe problem with making the internals of these classes less private is that it might (a) be reverted in the future as a code style cleanup by somebody who doesn't know it's being used downstream, or (b) prevent us from making necessary changes because we're worried about breaking downstream code.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the community seems to have already made up its mind about forking the engine, it might just be easier to direct these kind of compatibility fixes there... but that doesn't seem reasonable either."

(To stop the misassumptions I've noticed in the IRC logs, the other ones were the already-mentioned actor variations possibility in https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12554#issuecomment-271105904, and my bad experiences in regards to #11624 and #11311.
