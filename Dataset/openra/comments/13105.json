It works for e.g. Guard, because this Trait is defined in Common so it can be done directly after key press.

It is inconsistent to have a deploy cursor but then not a deploy hotkey or description for this, so to address this issue here, IMO the fix is to remove the deploy functionality entirely and stick with the ALT modifier."

You don't even need to touch the command line.\r\n- Many other applications that are regularly used on Linux catch the ALT key (e.g. Inkscape). They run into the same issue with those window managers. Do a google search on \"KDE alt drag window\" and all you get are links to people asking how to turn that \"feature\" off.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion: This is not an issue with OpenRA; It is an (easily solved) issue with those window managers. This is **not** something that OpenRA should concern itself with."
