It pretty much forced me to make it continuous.\nBut I am going to try and play with it regardless, see if anything breaks during a play-test.\n"

WeldingPart was the part it was throwing (with randomized colors and velocities, the EC can be ignored because it was longer than the amount of frames they'd need to reach the ground and IIRC these particles just faded away imminently when reaching it) and WeldingSys controlled the effect (spawning 20 particles in each frame for 25 frames).\n\n@Marnador D2k already has dummy weapons to properly render the trike's firinganims. See https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/mods/d2k/weapons/smallguns.yaml#L162 for such a dummy implementation - you do not even need to specify a value within the damagewarhead. I also stated that you should have a lot of dummyweapons (Armament@dummy1, Armament@dummy2 up to, say, 10) because yes, you cannot fire a weapon twice during the same frame.\n"

    "body": "@Marnador Okay, I had some thoughts on this. There are two issues with my method as-was (again, I still aim for the feelies):\n1) The weldsparks cannot use Burst since that'll go out of sync - however using Armament's FireDelay will fix that, although that will mean even more dummyweapons, each having a single Burst (dummyweapon 1-10 having no FireDelay 11-20 has a frame of 1 or 2). This probably looks sloppy in the yaml for some though.\n2) The TS sparks changed their color. Well, there are two options here, one can either use 1x1 animated projectiles or create a custom palette with crude but suitable gradients (IMO HSL based, with L varied from bright to dark, say 20% steps or more) and have an 1x1 SHP with the amount of frames of the HSL gradients, each having the gradient's white color and then use RotationPaletteEffect to switch colors instead of animating the SHP itself, setting up, so that each frame is a separate sequence of the same image. (I kinda prefer this latter myself tbh).\n\nI'm all fine if you won't experiment with this, though but this is where I'd go regarding the welding sparks.\n"
