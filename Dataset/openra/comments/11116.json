    "body": "The best solution for this would be to simply show/hide the window, however it seems OpenRA doesn't suppport hiding modal windows atm or am I wrong @pchote? (hiding of windows opened by Ui.OpenWindow - when I tried to hide returned Widged it hided also main/parent window). \r\n\r\nIt is simple to select last focused map (after Close) and tab, but it is more work to recover last category. It can be done but I need at first confirmation this is wanted."
