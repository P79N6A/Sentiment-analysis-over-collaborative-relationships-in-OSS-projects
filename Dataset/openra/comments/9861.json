    "body": "I'm not convinced by this: it's a short term hack around something that we know needs to be completely redone in the medium term.  The current two hardcoded resource types are far too restrictive, and don't cover the needs of... pretty much anything except our default RA and TD mods.  As you've mentioned: RA2 only has a single resource type, TS needs a new resource type (veins), and we've had requests from people who wanted to implement AOE-style resources.\n\nI think we should instead be thinking about how to break out individual resource type traits, and then have the traits that reference them (`Refinery`, `GiveCashCrateAction`, etc) specify the resource type that they provide / consume.\n"
