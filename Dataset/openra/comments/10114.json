    "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nOP calling the current grenadier \"almost useless\" is incorrect - as of late 2015 (same year as this issue was posted) Grenadiers has become widely used and integrated with Soviets early game. As far as I'm concerned the RA Grenadier is balanced. Holding off quick waves of solid blobs of grenadiers sounds like a nightmare to me. Besides, watching exploding blobs of grenadiers is immensely satisfying.\r\n\r\nIf there's a proper way to emulate the 'bugged' behavior with proper code I'd recommend doing so."
