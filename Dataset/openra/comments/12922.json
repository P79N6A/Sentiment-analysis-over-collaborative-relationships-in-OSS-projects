    "body": "You're right. You can't move to some bridge tiles (to middle of bridge you can). You also can't move above buildings with left-click orders. I understand you prefer left-click orders, but it seems right-click orders are generally better, you can move also above buildings and bridgers.\r\nAs you wrote building is selectable, bridge not so you should be able to move there with left click. If someone can confirm this is bug, I would investigate it."
