    "body": "The badly damaged building stood in enemy's territory and it was the only thing giving me vision there. When I sold it (the selling animation was fine, but I got no units out of it) the place got covered by fog of war and an image of the building appeared (although it was no longer there since I sold it). When I regained vision of the place moments later it was \"erased\" for good (from the fog of war view).\nI can't remember if the image of the building was displayed in my color or the color of previous owner. As I mentioned the glitch is not present in the replay.\n\nI tried to recreate this with a custom map from the editor, but the two times I tried I always got a civilian when selling the damaged structure so I still had vision...\n"
