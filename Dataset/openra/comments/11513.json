    "body": "The difference between the solution that Paul envisions and the one that you've written is the level they're working at. Your solution basically decouples `Health` from dealing with warheads, while what Paul really wants (as far as I understood it) would decouple - or split, more correctly - warheads and weapons. Ie. the only warheads that would remain after would be `DamageWarhead` and its children, while the rest would evolve to become some kind of effect that could be spawned by weapons, warheads or anything else, really. @pchote, correct me if I stated this wrongly in any way.\n\nNow, the question is whether this PR stands in the way of such a future rewrite. The code added in this PR would certainly not survive it, but I haven't really made up my mind yet (since I'm not sure what that rewrite would look like exactly) whether it would block it, or make it harder to do. \n"
