    "body": "I didn't reproduce the bug after rebase, this PR and issue #12372 can be closed.\r\n\r\nYou can ignore, small observation: \r\nwhen creating PlaceBuilding or LineBuild order, there is check (CanPlaceBuilding, IsCloseEnoughToBase). This check is repeated in Resolve order for PlaceBuilding. It wasn't/isn't for LineBuild. The bug occured before, because new LineBuild Actor was created in foreach, and if not run, caused that bug. Now actor is created before foreach, so the bug doesn't happen. The check is still missing, so the behaviour could be little different in edge cases."
