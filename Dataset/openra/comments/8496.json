Somebody needs to take charge of this feature and write up something specifying exactly how upgrades and their levels should interact with traits in all the different cases, and then we can work from there.  If we don't, then I expect we will end up chasing regressions for the next release cycle.\n"

What one expects is that this trait implements four independent upgrades: e.g. if I grant a unit from TS `firepower` and `speed` upgrades, the actor should only inflict 10% more damage when attacking and move 20% more quickly. However, right now, if you just grant each of those two upgrades once, you will get full elite behavior: 30% more firepower, 66% damage taken from attacks, 50% quicker movement and 75% the reload time. This is clearly not what this trait is meant to do. Now, in order to properly fix this, a blueprint of the upgrade system's logic is necessary and needs to be agreed upon. So this is what I'm waiting for right now.\n\n`UpgradableTrait` however (and all traits that inherit from it), works correctly with things as they are.\n"

    "body": "Actually, I plan on splitting GainsStatUpgrades into separate traits and have since about the time of the introduction of UpgradableTrait. The problem with GainsStatUpgrades is that it clumps functionality together (fire-power modifier, damage modifier,...). One reason for the bug may be this bad design making functionality non-obvious. If I remember correctly, I'm not the only one who thinks it should be split.\n\nSince GainsStatUpgrades should be replaced with separate traits and this seems to have no other use (so far), This probably should be closed for now at least and possibly an issue opened regarding this functionality to figure out what to do first.\n"

If what @atlimit8 is saying should be done, i.e., if the system should be designed so that each trait uses at most one parameter (sum of all upgrade levels) instead of multiple parameters (independent upgrade levels for different upgrades), then\n- `GainsStatUpgrades` indeed needs refactoring and\n- I'd say the notifications, that the `UpgradeManager` sends, should contain only information on this one parameter (upgrade level sum) instead of also saying which upgrade triggered the latest aggregate level change.\n  That would make this PR unwanted.\n\nIf, on the other hand, traits should be allowed to provide upgrades that depend on multiple independent parameters (upgrade levels), then this PR would be OK, but the `GainsStatUpgrades` would be the only trait using this functionality and the `UpgradableTrait` should be updated (this is what I've done locally).\n\nBasically the question is - single or multiple parameters for upgrades?\n"
