    "body": "First of all, please one issue per ticket.  Also please use the search function before opening a ticket. We have over a thousand open tickets, many of them suggestions, and the chances that someone already had the same idea as you've had are very high. Consequently, a lot of your points are duplicates of existing issues.\r\n\r\n1. Duplicate of #6131.\r\n\r\n2. and 6. are basically the same.\r\n\r\n3. Duplicate of #4492.\r\n\r\n4. Just as 2. and 6., you're basically asking for a MP campaign lobby. We might get there eventually, but for now, I don't even know anyone who's working on a coop campaign, so implementing a lobby for that now would just be wasting time.\r\n\r\n5. Duplicate of #2743.\r\n\r\n6. See 2.\r\n\r\n7. Just no.\r\n\r\n8. Duplicate of #4492.\r\n\r\n9. Ah well, I'll allow it.\r\n\r\nI'm gonna close this as WONTFIX for now. As I mentioned, we might get around to this eventually, but I suspect this ticket would otherwise still be open five years down the road."

    "body": "Even tho it wasn't working really fine, in RA2/YR it was possible to give a player control of more than one House. I was using it mostly on some of my maps that has some Allied units on Soviet Commander's control and vice versa during YR Campaign. It is a bit annoying that we can't do that here as i actually need that on a map. Some playing with palettes can solve the remap part but it would still show Allied color and name on tooltip.,"
