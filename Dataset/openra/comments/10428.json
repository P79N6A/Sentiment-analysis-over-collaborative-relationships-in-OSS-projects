    "body": "@Truth99A Well I have my own thoughts on balance of this unit. I wasn't going to say anything since I really want to see how the suggestions in the other thread  #10437 play out first, but I'll throw this out there anyway since people are talking about it.\n\nI would like the MAD thump/quake to out-range all artillery units, have a verrry low DPS and no detonation. The MAD tank could have very high HP with the ability to undeploy, while taking its own quake damage fairly slowly. That would give it a very unique role in that it would be an almost continual but slow source of low damage. This would force infantry and air counters but allow the time to prepare for that. \n\nNot only would it be a real area of denial weapon, but you could use a group of them to tank damage from defences rather than lay siege from a distance. If you did choose to deploy them, to increase the very weak DPS you could deploy a group of them - but then they would damage themselves much faster - so it would be a balancing act. Do you use a single one over a prolonged period of time to harass an enemy and force their hand or do you just deploy a bunch an cause higher damage over much less time?\n\nBut in all honesty I would like it if the Allies got the (buffed) MAD and the Soviet mammoth a got a buff to make it viable again. I'd rather see both units have _very_ high HP and be dedicated damage soakers with extremely poor DPS. I think @cjshmyr's idea of buffing the med/heavy hp slightly is definitely needed, but it would only further relegate the currents mammoths role.\n\nAt the moment, apart from support weapons and fragile V2s/artys, we do not have any units that properly tank. And I mean tank. Mammoths literally get shredded by base defences and RSs without an IC in seconds.\n\nIt's a fairly controversial idea for the purists, but it could open up some interesting strategies on chokey maps, esp in combination with slow and fragile infantry as well as air units.\n"
