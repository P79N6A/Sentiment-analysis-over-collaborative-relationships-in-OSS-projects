    "body": "I spent many hours today to debug into OpenRa C# code. I kind of make debugging using zerobrane on OpenRA working. However, it is not as good as visual studio. Here are some steps:\r\n\r\nYou will need to know how to remote debug a 'hello world' program on a regular lua program running on lua.exe first. \r\nhttps://studio.zerobrane.com/doc-remote-debugging\r\n\r\nzerobrane lua remote debugger concept is a little bit different, so it confused me for some time initially.  When your lua script execute [require('mobdebug').start()], it actually start a TCP debug connection to 127.0.0.1 port 8172 where the ZeroBrane debugger listens to. \r\n\r\nHere are some places need to be modified: [Warning:These modification may cause some security breach on sandbox] \r\n\r\n1. In scriptwrapper.lua\r\nchange package.path to\r\npackage.path = GameDir .. \"/lua/?.lua;\" .. package.path\r\n\r\n2. In sandbox.lua \r\nadd \"require\" after \"xpcall\"\r\nIt may popup more missing variable or api in visual studio output window. You can just add them there.\r\n\r\n3. string.rep is overwritten by OpenRa, it caused some issue when you want to watch display variable. \r\nin \\zerobrane\\lualibs\\mobdebug.lua\r\nchange  local prefix = string.rep(indent or '', level)\r\nto\t  local prefix = ''\r\n\r\n4. After that you can insert 'break point', require('mobdebug').start() in your lua script.\r\n\r\nWorldLoaded = function()\r\n  ....\r\n  require('mobdebug').start() \r\n  ...\r\n\r\n\r\nRoland\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
