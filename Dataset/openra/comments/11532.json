    "body": "I don't like anything presented in the PR. I like that shock troopers are better than all other infantry in the game. It's an expensive unit and it must be good. Their main problem, in my opinion is that they destroy **all** vehicles in seconds (and even outrange tanks by 2 cells!). My main complaint about them is the range. My humble suggestion is not to make any drastic changes anymore, but make their range/vision equal to the rifler's vision. Another suggestion: `range = riflerVision + 1cell`, so they can be used as a support unit.\n\nWhat makes them OP is that it's just too easy to a-move them, without microing. With the range change you would need to care about their positioning. I think it's a good balance change to try, without breaking the current balance (which I believe this PR will do). I also don't see how the proposed change is related to tesla tanks at all. It just doesn't make any sense, these units are not logically dependant on each other in any way.\n\nSummarising, I think reducing their range is the way to go (but leaving everything else the same). This leaves a chance for dogs to eat them, tanks to reach them, defence structures to live a little bit longer. In 1v1 versus any infantry, a shock trooper will still win, which is how it should be. As of now, because of the range they feel like mini-inf-arties.\n"

    "body": "Hello everyone, i thought i would pitch in here. I have played hundreds of games using Russia in the past year on a variety of maps which has given me a lot of experience using shock troopers. In my (unpopular) opinion shock troopers shouldn't be nerfed but i am willing to push this belief to one side and accept the health nerf due to the amount of people who are unhappy with shock troopers. I will try to be non-biased and since i will be playing Ukraine mainly from now on i don't really have a reason to protect Shock Troopers. \n\nShock Troopers are actually a really hard unit to get. They cant be rushed against someone who scouting properly and are expensive to produce. Also, the current meta is large armies and open maps which means that rushing shock troopers results in you being trampled by the opponents army as you have sacrificed production for tech which wont pay off until you have built shock troopers.\n\nBut on some maps (such as Behind the Veil or Winter Storm) it is much more possible to rush them as the map has more available chokes and longer rush distances. But even then it is still possible  to counter shock troopers. Shock Troopers require a lot of income to build constantly and  so mass expanding an opponent who is tech rushing is also a possible counter, although less intuitive and is the least utilized counter measure i have seen vs shockies. So there is still learning to do for quite a  few people as most are too focused on winning by attacking instead of winning through attrition.\n\nBack to the meta. As i have already mentioned, the meta is focused around large armies: infantry and tank armies to be exact. Opening with a tank/infantry composition is so common that you will see it in pretty much every game with moderately skilled players. This is such easy prey for shock troopers if the opponent keeps this up into the late game. Artillery is also common due to the infantry masses that are created but the flak/shocky combo is a hard counter to this. Harassment based tactics such as chrono shifting enemy harvesters and utilizing longbows(this will be much better if they get buffed any time soon) are far better vs shockies than the norm atm.\n\nWell that's why they do so well in the meta. Now onto the proposed changes:\n\nRange - Back when shock troopers were truly OP their range was they only thing changed and that's all it took to make an OP unit. RA is very dependent on range as it takes so long for units to get into range if they are being out-ranged. Changing it down, even slightly, could break the unit and make it useless again. Test it though.\n\nDamage - Well you really need to have a lot of  shockies to do a better job than the cheaper infantry. Rocket troopers kill vehicles faster in small numbers, same with flamers and buildings, grens and buildings, rockets and defences although am unsure about rifles and infantry. Though rifles change their role to meat shields to break up shock troopers and increase their survivability.\n\nSlight fire delay - maybe but i don't think both this and the health nerf should be applied. I could  see this working out well on it's own though and it would make the range not as overpowering. It would also make shock troopers an aggressive unit as a player with the intuitive vs defensive shock troopers could exploit the charge time to do real damage.\n\nEDIT - Oops, didnt notice it was closed just minutes ago :s\n"
