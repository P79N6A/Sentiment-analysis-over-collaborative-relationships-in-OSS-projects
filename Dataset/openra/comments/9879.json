    "body": "MicroJOo has a point. Imho the problem is the movement of infantry in general. It is also very noticeable with tanya and infantry moving 'into' buildings.\n\nIf you order a hijacker to steal a vehicle in a cell and that vehicle moves as the hijacker moves into that cell you expect either three things to happen;\n-Go to the original cell, then move directly to the cell the vehicle moved to\n-Change direction as the vehicle is moving taking the shortest route (not sure if this is possible with the current implementation)\n-Capture the vehicle a cell away (as other games seem to do to solve this issue)\n\nCurrently however, the hijacker is 'repulsed' and generally moves back a cell in the opposite direction - which given the hijackers role, is puzzling to a player and can be viewed as a bug / glitch / etc\n\nDepending on how the vehicle moves too can add to the frustration. If the vehicle moves toward the direction of the hijacker it gets squished without capturing the vehicle which again seems like a glitch from a player point of view #9560\n\nLikewise a tanya under fire nearly always seems to crawl to a cell then crawl to a different cell before returning fire. I expect her to crawl to one cell and then return fire (although this could be #9851)\n\nThen you have the issue of infantry visually entering buildings when they actually don't and getting crushed by a vehicle in a 'different' cell #8064\n\nAnd also #9197\n\nThese situations might be working fine by code design but from a game-play point of view all these issues seem 'off' to me and give the impression of all being related (even though they probably aren't).\n"
