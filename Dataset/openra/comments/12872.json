I'm admittedly biased towards expanding the role of the army in RA and I've been under the impression that the mid-game is currently a bit underdeveloped. I mentioned some other place, the current meta, even the idea of a mid- and late game are very recent and there's been no significant alteration on that part since the rise of the competitive scene. That's why I wasn't in a rush to address the late-game for RA this release cycle, especially with the last rounds of balance PR's being stalled towards this release. \r\n> \r\n> I agree the late game will likely be pushed a bit more into the background as the result of the latest balance PR. The re-balancing of important mid-game assets (def.structures, barracks...) and the delayed MCVs will definitely put the mid-game up in the air for a while with armies ravaging the battlefield. Bare in mind tho this is also what happened shortly after the 1v1 scene started picking up speed. Eventually (if the re-balancing works as promised) the meta will settle and players will find their way into the late game quicker - to which I suspect will be a big focus towards the release after the next one. \r\n> \r\n> Btw the play-test builds was started solely on the background of the new gap generator effect and I just decided to have some fun with it with the experimental builds. I'll probably stick with rounds of play-test map for the future. The 1.5 series already include a 71-speed MCV: http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=83&t=19944 \r\n> \r\n> As for the $1600 War.Fac have you considered fiddling around with the custom build time exclusively? I was also playing around with a $500 Barracks to address the money-hole barracks vs War.Fac + taxing players spamming barracks with base-pushes.\r\n>\r\n>..."

    "body": "   The 8s delay has a minor effect on large maps, such as Sidestep or Shadowfiend, where there are long distances / multiple places to place an MCV, but on smaller maps where there are only 1 or 2 viable locations to basepush, the 8s delay has a very substantial effect on the game. On paper, the 8s delay on the secondary MCV should buff early armies, but one couldn't be farther from the truth. \r\n\r\nWhat it actually buffs are early, aggressive basepushes involving the original MCV. Due to the enormous and HP of the MCV / Conyard, it is nearly impossible to stop, even when properly scouted. In a sense, one could also say that the early army actually is buffed in this situation, but a good player will always couple it with an MCV to make sure this rush succeeds. Newer players already have a tremendous problem dealing with this strategy, and the 40s MCV does not help this at all.  Implementing a slight MCV move speed here would also help tremendously. If we share the same vision of improving the game, away from MCV-centric play, then we need to at least try to address this with the $1650 WF. Allowing 8 seconds less of infantry production should bring the original balance back to what it currently is -- after this, then we can talk about expanding the mid game past it's current situation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "That feels like quite the hyperbole TBH, but if I were to artificially boil down your comment I'm left with:\r\n\r\n- Early MCV pushes will be more favored/prevalent due to expansions being taxed in the balance PR.\r\n\r\nWhich I could certainly entertain but you're also making the case that +8s built MCV makes the original base-push strategy _stronger_. Are you hypothesizing here or are you referring to the actual playtest experience with a $2k, 40s MCV?\r\n\r\nHypothetically I don't see the math but it also corresponds poorly with my exposure to the 40s MCV up to this date as described in #12739. If I'm mistaken that'd be very unfortunate and I'd have to review my approach altogether. I'll bookmark this for future reference."

In order to prevent this, players have to build larger armies earlier into the game in order to expand safely; this creates a lot of passive gameplay with 1 or 2 game-deciding battles, one of which is this early basepush.
