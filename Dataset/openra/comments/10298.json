But also to me the official map pool as a whole feels a bit cluttered. I'd say that the official maps should be:\n\n1) Balanced (although this does not mean symetric per se)\n2) Aestehic\n3) Showcasing all the tilesets\n4) Include both small and big maps, and some maps with naval warfare\n5) Not include near duplicates, nor have to many maps\n"
