There is nothing to break, because OpenRA doesn't support TS-style overlays.  The purpose of the map importer is to convert the concepts/data used by the original engine to those used by the OpenRA engine.

    "body": "Reinforcing the point further, we actually have all the logic you need to implement low bridge destruction.  The only bits we're still missing for complete low bridges are the random art selection (this could be done with a random upgrade trait switching different WithSpriteBody traits) and demolition/repair via bridge huts.\n\nYou can implement destruction by setting up two \"normal\" actors (one for each bridge orientation), two \"dead\" husk actors, and the four ramps (set up like the normal actors).  The normal actors have regular and damaged art states, and spawn the \"dead\" actors on death.  The \"dead\" actors use WithWallSpriteBody to render the damaged-end overhang when they are next to or between undamaged bridge segments.  The artwork for the different adjacency cases are in different files, which you assemble into a single sequence for the wall trait using an aggregate sequence.\n"
