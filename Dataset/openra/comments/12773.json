    "body": "Some fixups on the current version:\r\n* I would like to see the \"Open â˜­ Sourced\" in the intro sequence changed to \"Open Source\" (drop the D and logo), possibly using a font like http://imgur.com/iFgp3ED.  \"Open Sourced\" is an action, implying that the code was previously closed source.  Dropping the logo is to simplify life in the near/medium future when we change the main project logo - removing it here means that we only need to replace the title card when that happens.\r\n* The RA shot with the destroyers shows the old GPS icons and should be updated.\r\n* D2K has changed a lot in the last couple of years, so i'm sorry to say that I think it all needs to be updated (the big clips at least - the small montages are probably fine).  Specific issues include the weapon effects, bounties, and sandworm.\r\n* One of the TD clips shows a christmas present crate.  It's a minor point, but IMO that should be cut out to avoid confusion."

At the end of April (no later than May 7th) I should have the final edit of the video montage. The last 4 weeks (May 8th - June 2nd) should concern itself to nothing else than refining text-style/after-effects and the end-title - this will likely prove very demanding, going back and forth on countless issues in this time period.\r\n\r\n@pchote: the intro title text/logo can possibly be altered by bringing aboard new titles that overlap the original footage. unfortunately the project file covering the first 10 seconds has been lost so there's limited maneuverability without compromising video quality. I'll early re-shoot the D2K Sonic Tank \"lazer\" weapon but for the rest outdated features it'll stay a bit behind in the priority queue.\r\n\r\n@kyrylo: had planned for a Demo Truck in a ending-montage sequence ;)\r\n\r\n@Smittytron: I'll grab that webcam footage thankyouverymuch \\o/"
