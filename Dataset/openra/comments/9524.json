I'm not sure if you never played CNC Tiberium Dawn, or followed the storyline of the game, but it was a part of the history of the game, and part of the game's dynamics.\r\n\r\nTiberium spreads. Its a cancer. A Virus. It'll grow and convert living things over to its side. People. Trees. Your harvester blows up in your base, now its a minefield.\r\n\r\nAlso a big thing to note, is that free-standing units didnt die in Tiberium in Dawn like they do now. This I'm not sure if I'd consider a bug that this is changed in OpenRA, but without the spreading built into the game, I am not sure \r\n\r\nHere is a cutscene in TD showing a crystal spreading into 3 pods of crystals:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bImKihXUU6A&feature=youtu.be&t=289\r\n\r\nHere is another cutscene showing tiberium taking trees over:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/bImKihXUU6A?t=799"
