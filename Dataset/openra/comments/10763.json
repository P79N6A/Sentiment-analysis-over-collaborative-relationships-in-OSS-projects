    "body": "@pchote\nActually, alpha blending works fine. The reason why it looked glitchy is that `WithMuzzleOverlay` seems to be really broken. It uses the palettes of all defined `Armament`s at once.\nAnd that means if you add an `Armament` that does not define a custom palette, even if that `Armament` has not muzzle effect, its default `MuzzlePalette` (`effect`) will be used anyhow. Generally speaking it also seems to draw the last defined `Armament`'s muzzle on top, but if that last `Armament`'s `MuzzlePalette` uses alpha transparency, you can see the muzzle drawn in default `effect` palette below it.\n\nBasically, it's probably been broken ever since the trait isn't defined for every individual Armament anymore, there just weren't any mod setups that exposed it, until now.\n"
