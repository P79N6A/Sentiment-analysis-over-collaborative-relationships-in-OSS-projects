It requires an offline build (no dependency fetching from the internet) just like http://build.opensuse.org The good thing is we get #2585 and #3041 for free as there are different release channels and auto-update support via GNOME Software and the KDE equivalent."

    "body": "Flatpak packages can be compiled into [single file bundles](http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/single-file-bundles.html) which can be opened directly with the Gnome software center (and I assume similar tools on other DEs).\r\n\r\nReopening this ticket because having our own automatically updated package is important, and I don't see any real technical barrier to offering one (aside from working out how to package it on travis). It is not good enough to tell players that they can't play online with their friends during the ~week after a release because the fedora or arch (or etc...) packages have not been updated yet and we can't help and don't know when that will be fixed.\r\n\r\nThese `.flatpak` bundles are able to configure a repository for automatic updates (see https://firefox-flatpak.mojefedora.cz/ for an example), however these repositories [cannot be hosted on github](https://flatpak.org/faq.html#Can_I_host_my_flatpak_app_on_github_). I expect that the first implementation would push a static bundle (without automatic updates) to the github release, just like the deb package (and possibly superseding it), and that future work could implement pushing to a flatpak repo on the master server.\r\n\r\nAt some point I'd like to prototype this with/for the Mod SDK (instead of https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK/issues/56)."

    "body": "After spending some time with it I am quite impressed with how simple and relatively clean the Flatpak system is for both users and developers.  With one exception: the sandbox breaks our cross-mod switching, and there doesn't seem to be any replacements, workarounds, or even (as far as I can tell) a lot of interest upstream to solve the problem of cross-application communication.\r\n\r\nWe can fix the metadata registration and consuming by properly sharing the `~/.openra` directory (`\"--filesystem=~/.openra\"`) and enabling read-only access to the rest of the filesystem (`\"--filesystem=host:ro\"`), but there is no way to break out of or switch to a different sandbox to launch another isolated OpenRA instance.\r\n\r\nThis is one of OpenRA's tent-pole features, so I can't get behind promoting Flatpak for OpenRA until there is a solution."
