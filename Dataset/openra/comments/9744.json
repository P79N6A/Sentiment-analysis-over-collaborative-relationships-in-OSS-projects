    "body": "Looking good so far.\n\nOne style issue: in !cnc, the tab buttons have gaps between them, whereas in the lobby they don't.\n\nAnd one suggestion: the smallprint in direct ip mode could be moved into the tab proper. There's a lot of empty space there, so it wouldn't look as cramped below the minimap, and not as bland in main content area. Also you could choose a bigger font size to improve readability for that text. As I said, just a suggestion, not a request. Do with it what thou wilt.\n"

We could ignore it for now, since TS isn't shipped so the bug wouldn't be exposed, or we could remove the spawnpoints display until it is fixed. I'd probably go with the second option.
