I put it [here](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Traits/Attack/AttackFollow.cs#L95) and that successfully prevents the unit from shooting, but in my opinion units inside tunnels should also reject orders and continue moving until out of the tunnel, like in the original, to prevent them from being forgotten or intentionally hidden inside tunnels (if it's possible to make units stay in tunnels, players are sure to abuse that in MP)."
