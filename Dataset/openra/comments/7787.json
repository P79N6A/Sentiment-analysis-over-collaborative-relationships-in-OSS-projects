    "body": "Reading the title, I assumed the issue was that an approaching enemy spy plane would trigger the warning, but after reading the yaml rules, I found out that that should already not be the case.\n\nSo this is about the spy plane revealing enemy units, which then trigger the warning. With the current implementation, that is indeed not fixable.  The logic would have to be completely turned around.\n"
