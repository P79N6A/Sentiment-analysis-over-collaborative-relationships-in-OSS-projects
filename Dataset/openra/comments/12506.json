(Might be a different issue though.)\r\n\r\nAs example I've got this one Twisted Insurrection mission in mind, where you had to (iirc) escort a VIP to a evacuation zone. But as soon as you reach the destination, the transport gets destroyed by bombers and the mission ends (the VIP dying is part of the story). So you have accomplished the mission, but the objective \"Escort the VIP safely to the extraction zone\" being marked as \"Successful\" would seem odd to me.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can do that with \"unregistering\" (so it doesn't get too messy)?"
