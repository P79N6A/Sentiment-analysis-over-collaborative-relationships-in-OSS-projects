    "body": "This is the same type of problem, caused by interleaving FrameEndTasks, that #14220 fixed for capturing.\r\n\r\nThe basics of the fix here is the same: introduce a `DisposeSync` method and make sure that all disposals from inside FrameEndTasks use this instead of the async version.  Some careful thought and testing will be required to handle the activity disposing, as that currently relies on *not* being called from a FrameEndTask.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is too complicated to rush into a hotfix / the next playtest, so moving to Next + 1."
