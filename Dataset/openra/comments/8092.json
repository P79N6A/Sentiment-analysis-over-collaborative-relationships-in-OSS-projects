We also make it very easy anybody to compile OpenRA from source (download the source archive, and then run make.cmd, then choose dependencies and then all) if they don't want to use the installer.\n\nOne of the headline features of the next release will be improved integration with the host OS via file and url registrations.  This is done under windows by having the installer add entries into the registry.\n"

It should have dealt with it when the issue came up, though, so I'm not sure what's going on here.\n- Copy data to %AppData% if the folder isn't writable, and check there too.\n- [Have the installer set the Support (or main program folder) folder writable](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/AccessControl_plug-in) by all like Steam does. This might be the best solution.I'll see if I can do it myself.\n"
