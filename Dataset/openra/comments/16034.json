    "body": "I would like it if these modifiers could be set in the game settings and their values be applied to notifications that have the modifier trait. For example, instead of adding a generic `VolumeModifier`, add a `ChatNotificationVolumeModifier` and `GameNotificationVolumeModifier` (and others that can be used for a group of notifications.) \r\n\r\nOr, allow to define a modifier per notification in a `NotificationVolumeModifier` trait and bind that definition and a value to some sort of `NotificationVolumeManager`.

All in all this would give over a much more polished vibe regarding the whole project. These things are small but important.\r\n\r\nThe money ticks themselves being a nuisance or not is not widely debated, as the last attempt of fixing them (which resulted in the mute-option as we have it today) gave players that were annoyed by it (which is directly connected to it's volume most of the times) the chance to turn it off, whereas the vast majority simply doesn't care.\r\n\r\nIf it leads to more people not being inclined to turn it off because of it being too loud, then I am all for this fix."

So for those who have it disabled it will make no difference at all (obviously), and it will comfort the all-too-loud sounds into bearable zone. So subjectively I'm up for the fix.\r\n\r\nAlso, if I get it right, people will be able to modify other notification sounds volume via [simple enough] yaml modification."
