    "body": "Hello, I use mac os dark mode and the the game worked flawlessly for me in this hot fix and the version before it. This test build loads up the game not with the usual load screen screen but starts with a grey one and then continues to the original load screen. Whenever I start up a game/ replay/ map editor I can not edge scroll, it's like the game isn't fully full screen. The bug fixes permanently (atliest until I restart the program) when I move to another desktop and back (On mac os fullscreen works like a separate desktop and you work with multiple desktops on one monitor). When playing windowed the the dark theme works like it should and makes the top part of the window dark grey unlike the previous versions"
