    "body": "Wrong. This is introduced in this cycle.\r\n\r\nThis is caused by #15304 - previously dogs triggered the grenadier explosion and units are immune to their own explosions by default - https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Warheads/Warhead.cs#L47 - resulting with attacking dogs safely triggering grenadier explosions without scratches. However with the PR aforementioned, the explosions are now triggered by the dying grenadier, thereby the dog lost it's immunity.\r\n\r\nTwo sidenotes however:\r\nTS will definitely need selftriggering because WW games had no such explosion ownership transferring.\r\nI'm extremely unhappy to break my radio silence because people can't connect the dots."
