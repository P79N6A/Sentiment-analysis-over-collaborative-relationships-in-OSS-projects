    "body": "#11545 has a side-effect of installing the originally-sized infantry artwork for all players, so this isn't too infeasible.  I like the idea.  We can use the string-replacement support from the WIP translations backend to swap an explicit-package reference for the infantry between the hires and lores mixes.\n\nWe'd just need to:\n1. Remove the sniper and zombie assets that don't have small versions.\n2. Generalize the translation UI plumbing to either support multiple input options, or just repurpose the code that's already there (since it's unlikely to be used for translations anytime soon).\n3. Expose the checkbox in the RA display options.\n"

    "body": "Okay, just looked it up, in OpenRA the weapon ranges are calculated from the actor's center, so firing offset changes doesn't change range. (In Westwood games, the weapon ranges were calculated from the actual firing position, leading to bonus ranges from units like RA1 Cruiser or RA2 Grand Cannon over equivalents with same range but centered turret/omnifiring.)\n\nAlso, your testcase wouldn't showcase what I meant, since it's only SHP replacements, leading to stuff like the Flamer flames spawning in front of the unit above the flamethrower, while adjusting those would have led to my concern.\n"
