If you order it to move, however, it will.\n\nEdit: if I remove the no-takeoff-by-default commit, that issue will be gone.

    "body": "I'm not sure if it's a regression from this PR or an earlier one, but reloading still doesn't play nicely with the activity queue:\n- If you force-target the ground the plane will exhaust its ammo, return and reload, then fly to the rallypoint and circle.  Looks like TakeOff is being queued without a NextActivity.\n- If you force-target a civilian building the plane will exhaust its ammo, return and reload, then stay on the airfield.  Looks like TakeOff isn't running at all.\n\nIn both cases we should expect the plane to take off and continue its attack (at least until it is dead in the second case), and in both cases the target line still reflects that.\n"
