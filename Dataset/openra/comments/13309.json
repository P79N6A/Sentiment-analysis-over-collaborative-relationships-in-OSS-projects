    "body": "@leodew I like the idea of map-list-locked servers too, but then the players would have to have the maps allready installed, since there is no way to search/download maps from inside OpenRA. (Which would be a good feature)\r\n\r\nAlso @jeeveekaa I see conflicts with maps locking setting themselves. For example my mission maps have crates forced off and might have shroud locked on. Which would take precedence?"
