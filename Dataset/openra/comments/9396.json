    "body": "I think it is extremely premature to merge this, so this gets a :-1: from me.  There a bunch of other issues (such as trademark issues, lack of installer logic, etc), but these are what I consider to be the core blockers:\n- It is bad for the RA2 mod because it forces the high standards of our main repository guidelines onto the mod development.\n- It is bad for engine development because all new features and refactorings need to be aware of the RA2 mod (increasing the already overstrained review bandwidth, and taking development effort away from the other core mods).\n- It is bad for contributors, because if their PRs break RA2 then they are forced to find and install paywall-blocked assets so that they can test and fix their PRs.\n\nI inferred (possibly incorrectly) from various conversions that @Mailaender intended us mitigate the points above by relaxing our quality rules for the RA2 mod (i.e. it is okay if a pr breaks it because somebody can fix the mod later).  If we make that exception however, then I see there being no benefit to hosting the mod here vs in its own repository.\n\nThe benefits that have been claimed for this are:\n- A fresh approach / fresh start would provide a more maintainable code base than the existing external ra2 mod.\n- There aren't enough reviewers in the main ra2 mod repository, and maintaining it here encourages others to be involved.\n- Maintaining it in a separate repository makes it hard to keep it updated with regards to the main engine changes, and having multiple developer-specific forks means that there is confusion about the canonical upstream version.\n\nI personally do not think that the benefits of these points outweigh the negatives from above.\nA better compromise would be to maintain this in a separate OpenRA/RA2 repository instead of a developer-specific fork.\n\nThe question to be discussed and answered here is whether or not the tradeoffs are outweighed by the benefits.\n"

I for example easily lose the track of the @Phrohdoh repository, because github does not have subscriptions on commits alone - nevertheless I disagree with @Phrohdoh's \"purist\" POV - the Kirov change is a major change affecting gameplay for example.\n\nMy counterargument right now would be the scope-creeping - many people have already expressed interest at implementing RA2 features which might hurt the pacing of the TS/FS feature implementation and even D2k requires polish to be acceptable right now feature wise - Starports comes into my mind.\n\nOverall, I'm +0.5 on this, because tracking the RA2 mod development via the PRs would be really helpful for people IMO.\n"

That way we can release a preview version just before EA switches their freebie time limited promotional offer to \"Candy Crush: Zombie Edition\" again.\n\nI don't have time for creating and maintaining a segregated OpenRA/RA2 repository nor do I think a mod outside this volatile development repository can survive as well as be kept stable and compatible.

    "body": "> There aren't enough reviewers in the main ra2 mod repository, and maintaining it here encourages others to be involved.\n\nNo, I think you made a typo here. Let me correct that - \"maintaining it here forces others to be involved\".\n\nI won't go into arguments and counter-arguments. Those have been discussed _over_ and _over_ and _over_ again.\nI'll just leave my :-1: here. \n\n> [15:39:37] < penev|m> I think it's great to help get RA2 in shape\n> [15:39:52]  < penev|m> I've done some helping myself\n> [15:40:22]  < penev|m> But I stand firmly behind the \"don't merge ra2\" notion \n\nThe main argument is \"it would be easier to maintain the mod if it is in the official repo\". Sure. But have you asked yourself \"why would it be easier?\" ? I'll tell you - because the mod's maintainers won't have to rebase and update it themselves. They will be delegating that work to contributors. Yes, it will be up to whoever files a PR to also update RA2 (as part of the official mods). I do **not** see that as a fair tradeoff.\n\nAlso I said earlier today on IRC that I see **no** benefit to either OpenRA or RA2 to be gained by such a merge. I still haven't been shown any.  (Btw I think the idea to get a preview mod for the free offer hype is an interesting one, but it's still not worth it. Also that can be done without merging the mod.)\n\n(Oh, look at that, I got into the \"arguments and counter-arguments\" thing a bit.)\n\nP.S.: Also please don't make this about \"persuading the lead programmer\", because while this doesn't run well as a democracy, there is still a sizable chunk of the (admittedly quite small) dev team that is against this.\n"
