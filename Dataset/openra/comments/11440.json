    "body": "I think that's just another thing wrong with `AttackMove`. Each of the units you gave the order to tries to reach the `TargetPosition`, with the `nearEnough` parameter set to 1. First of all, we could increase that to two, but I don't think that would actually help. Due to the brain-dead nature of `AttackMove`, which restarts itself every time the actor goes idle, a new `Move` activity is generated at the same time, which then probably causes it to move even when it already is close enough.\n\n(Have I mentioned yet that `TickIdle` is a horrible kludge that needs to die a violent death?)\n"

    "body": "Regular moves use a `nearEnough` parameter of 8, which causes bad behavior when units are ordered across bridges or other choke points.  `nearEnough` really needs to be ripped out and replaced with a smarter check for whether the unit has reached something close enough to its destination.  It would be worth checking how the original games handled this.\n"
