    "body": "~Generally speaking this seems like a good idea, however I expect GetActorsAt to unconditionally check for actors without taking cell occupation into account. This might lead to cells unharvestable when \"occupied\" by a helicopter or some passable actor, if I'm not mistaken. I think it would be better to check whether the cell is really occupied by ground units (Mobile) or buildings rather than just checking for any actors.~"

What I've noticed is that when harvesters get stuck, they are always positioned diagonally. Probably caused due to previous parameter of 1: MoveTo never gets close enough, as value of 1 can not be close enough when diagonally positioned. The correct value would be 1.414 to 1.5 but since the values are in cells, 2 will cut this issue.\r\n\r\nThis will not solve congestion issue at PROC but this should be good for ore/tib field.
