    "body": "I wouldn't bet on it. We're still discussing if it's a real bug or if it \"works as designed\". What you're doing with your clicking is basically bogus. You start a new order with the second click before your first click is even finished. It's unfortunate that it regresses from the last release (in the last release, mouse clicks registered when you put the button down, now they do when you release the button), but on the plus side we get the joystick scrolling for it. It would be a shame having to remove that. We'll try to figure out a different way to solve this. If we can't find one, I suspect this will not be fixed after all.\n\nEdit: Moving the joystick scrolling to the middle button would probably be one way, although that would  make it harder to use.\n"

OpenRA is already a game where you have to be conscious of spam-clicking, I feel adding more waiting (click a, right click, pause, left click) is less than ideal, especially in intense battles.\n"
