    "body": "I'll state one issue with this set-up however. I believe a number of players currently use the team health colours in combination with always show health bars to instantly distinguish between enemy and friendly units on screen.\n\nWith the newly proposed set-up however, if a player sees a unit that hasn't taken any damage yet it will have no health-bar visible. The player will need to either glance at the minimap, hover over the unit or work out that units alliance from its LoS impact on fog of war.\n\nThis might not sound like much, but when players are jumping around the map, this can add split seconds to trying to work out what units are enemies and what are friendlies - and we will be removing this existing feature from the game. Tox players who will see insane amounts of units clashing at once will probably notice this removal the most. \n\nBefore I make any rewrites I would like to propose the checkbox (between standard and proposed) be changed to a restricted cycle;\n\n-Health and status bars visible on hover/select (standard)\n-Health bars visible on damage and status bars always visible (proposed)\n-Health and status bars always visible (existing)\n"
