    "body": "> Changes the radar code to draw the full map into the backing sprite.\n\nI see several issues with that. (Aside from \"shouldn't be done\")\n- Only the top and left cordons are drawn. Right and bot aren't.\n- As shown in [this screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/r4G645G.png) you can see the cordons on the radar, but not on the map (of course, this is ingame). Turns out the actor positioning doesn't account for the borders, so it shows the war factory is _inside_ the cordon.\n- With scripted map size changes, the player should not be shown anything other than the current map (shouldn't even know that it can expand) - hence the \"shouldn't be done\" (ingame). It's very nice for the map editor, of course.\n"
