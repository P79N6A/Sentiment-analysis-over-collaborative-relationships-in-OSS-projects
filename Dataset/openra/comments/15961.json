    "body": "The example of situation I had on my mind was: You have units defending your base and you have them in a group. You are under attack and don't have much time for micromanagement. Some of the units are damaged. You select them and move them to the repair bay, away from the combat. Then you want to select the rest of the unit group and give orders. So my idea was that as I order the damaged units to go for repairs, at the same time I would hit some key to remove them from the combat group.\r\nIt is of course possible to set them as another group, but I'm afraid that would only create mess."
