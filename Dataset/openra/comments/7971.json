I think it is still related though.\nI did check my perf graph in the settings menu, it just has a lot of stuff to render and for some reason renders them anew each tick. My graph was still not as bad as @StijnDW's, though.\n\nEdit: Why do his screenshots show **a ton** more batches than mine on the RA shellmap?\n"
