    "body": "Fudging z-offsets with arbitrary values to make them look \"right\" without understanding the significance of those values is a bad idea.  An offset of 1 is understandable because you need to push the sprites unambiguously above the terrain to avoid z-fighting.\r\n\r\nWhy do those specific tiles need values of 2 or 4? Without any other info my best guess is that we have a bug that is giving sprites with different frame sizes different base z-offsets, which (a) would be bogus, and (b) would mean that the changes in this PR are almost certainly wrong."
