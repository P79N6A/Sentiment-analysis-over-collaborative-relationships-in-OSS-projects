If there is a group there and you aim at the arty for example, it will start moving closer, yak comes with vision, v2 will shoot the closest enemy - instead of arty, but it's less annoying then the suicide walk -, vision goes away, v2 goes closer and get killed by the group.\r\n\r\n Force attack has the problem that the v2 won't change target.\r\n\r\nMaybe a thing like if the target is lost, keep moving until the spot is in your attack range but stop instead of shooting. So when the vision comes back v2 will shoot but won't ever move closer than you intended."

If we queue these moves as child activities then we can continue to check the status of the target, and recover if it becomes visible again before the move completes.  If the unit reaches the original target location without seeing it again, then we can give finally give up as we do now."
