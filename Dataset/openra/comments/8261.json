All of the death animations for the cyborg+cyborg commando will go totally unused.\r\nSeems to make little sense that say a flamethrower could remove the legs of the unit and unfortunate if the specific flame death animation for this unit would also go unused as a consequence.\r\nAn oversight from Westwood in the original TS which I hope isn't transferred to OpenRA TS."
