    "body": "When the game freezes (or the connection stalls) for one player, then it will freeze for all players.  If you freeze for too long then the server will show the connection problems warnings and possibly kick you.  That's all behaving as expected.\n\nAs for the cause of the freezes... if there are crashes without an exception.log then it means that the problem isn't with OpenRA itself, but something lower level in your OS.  The usual culprit is buggy graphics card drivers.  Try installing an older version.\n"

It appears to have two GPUs: an AMD FirePro w4150 graphics and Intel HD Graphics 5500.\n\n@pchote \nAre you saying it is completely impossible for the game to crash without an exception log as a result of a crappy router, because the connection issue would be caught by the application code? \n\nI will do some more tests and keep you posted. I can run the game through a different internet connection to rule out connection issues. And since I apparently have two graphics cards I can switch and see if one of them causes trouble.\n"
