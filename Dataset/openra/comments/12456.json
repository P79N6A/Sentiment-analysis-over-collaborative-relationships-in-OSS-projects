    "body": "Main issue with this idea is that the martial arts idle anim only has artwork for left and right facings at best, while everything else has 8 animations. The end result would look akin to how pre-4 Heroes looked or Street Fighter if they were used as actual animations and not idle visuals. Which would look really jarring next to the fact that every actual fighting anim has 8 or 32 facings.\r\n\r\nI never played Dawn of War, nor I am interested in it, but infantry engaging in close combat only makes sense if said infantry has unit command bars where you can set the infantry to drop it's range. (Case in point I'd think of is Colonel Burton's knife in Generals, where Burton could kill infantry if you set that mode.) This unit command bar feature is missing from OpenRA however, and using the deploy command for this might not be visible enough to illustrate that this Minigunner is now in melee mode."
