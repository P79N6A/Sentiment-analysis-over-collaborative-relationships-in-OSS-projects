    "body": "The goal here is to build a system where mod-defined traits can react differently to damage, without needing each one to add its own fields to the engine code.  An alternative (and maybe cleaner?) approach to the same problem could be to split DamageWarhead into even smaller parts, with `DeathAnimationWarhead`, `ProneModifierWarhead`, etc, and then change the attack code to work with the set of warheads instead of just the one applying damage.\n"
