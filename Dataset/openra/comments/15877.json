Obviously, no matter what this will end up being at least somewhat ambiguous. I think what feels least ambiguous is the best bet, and I think that is arrows / some kind of indicator to the side like the arrows and here are a few points for my reasoning: \r\n> \r\n> 1. The meaning on its own may not be super clear immediately, but people should figure it out pretty quickly as they queue things up. \r\n> 2. Underlining will still have that advantage, but underlining has well-established and concrete meaning and cultural significance outside ORA that doesn't really align with the usage there at all and I think this should be avoided. An arrow to the side pointing at the next in queue aligns pretty well already with what an arrow means, so it's a better subconcious indicator. \r\n> 3. A similar problem arises from just changing the next in queue's text's color to yellow; it already has significant meaning throughout ORA.\r\n\r\nAnother argument in favor of a glyph is that it would be easy for mods to change it and even remove it."
