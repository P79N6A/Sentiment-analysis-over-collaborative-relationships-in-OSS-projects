Having a 10 cell radius guarantee-kill for aircraft looks unreasonable. I don't think the fun aspect would be affected much given that aircrafts are never considered targets for the demo truck despite it's effect against them.\n"

It's meant to strictly say \"Nerf Demo Truck's A-Bomb damage against air units\", not \"Nerf Demo Truck **and** A-Bomb damage against air units. \n\nI never meant to say the Demo Truck should be nerfed in general but that's what the discussion coagulates around, and I didn't realize until now. Sorry for wasting your time guys:/\n\nI'll be making a new issue at a later time.\n"
