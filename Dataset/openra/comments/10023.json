And that is disabling auto targeting under shroud (gap generator) when there is a GPS available.\nI believe you are refering to #9999, which is fixed by #10007 and is totally different - it's about firing at an already acquired target that moves into shroud.\nBasically both of these PRs each fix half of the problem. For best results you need them both, but for the moment you can test each separately.\n"
