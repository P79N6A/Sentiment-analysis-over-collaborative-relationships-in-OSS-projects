    "body": "This is an idea i've had in the back of my head for a while: The best way to approach this will be to change the middle 'Overlays' editor tab to a more general \"special brush types\", with an interface that lets traits define their own brush types that are exposed there.  You'd then have a brush type trait for resources (one instance per resource type), a brush type trait for \"give me one of N random actors\" (with an instance for trees, another for boxes, etc), another for cliffs, one for TS/RA2 style bridges, and one for tunnels.  This solves the issue of mod-specific data.\n"
