    "body": "The current bleed branch and future playtests/releases have a new modding system where mods do not depend on our \"official\" releases.  The [mod template](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModTemplate) is the modding SDK that we are developing to make it easy to develop/test/build installers for these new stand-alone mods.\r\n\r\nThe default behaviour of the SDK will be to fetch a specific engine version (e.g. a playtest or release build) from our main repository, but it will be a one line configuration file change to pull the engine from a different source (e.g. @GraionDilach's modder-friendly [Attacque Superior fork](https://github.com/AttacqueSuperior/Engine) or your own custom version).\r\n\r\nThe template is still a work in progress and missing quite a few features, but we are going to finish all the important parts before we ship the OpenRA release that removes the old modding support.  You may have to just trust me for now that this will make life *so much better* for modders and players."
