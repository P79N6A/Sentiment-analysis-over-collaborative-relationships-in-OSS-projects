    "body": "Unfortunately there is a lot more work required before we can add statistics to the forum extension. IIRC there are three blockers: the authentication framework needs to be polished, servers need to learn about wins/losses and we need to come up with a system to ensure that these servers send valid, non-manipulated data. Last point is I think subject of #14686. Issues for the forum frontend/backend can also be added to [OpenRA/openrauseraccounts](https://github.com/OpenRA/openrauseraccounts)."
