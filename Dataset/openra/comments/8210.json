    "body": "@pchote, I've just remembered that RA2 goes even further than the production queue. Any paradrops, units left after building destruction and crate-spawned units need to be upgraded as well (if RA2 behavior is to be replicated). This in particular means that the upgrades should take place at actor creation, not when adding to world (right now paradropped units are not in the world until they land - probably should also be changed for RA2).\n\nMy questions - how much sense does it make to use global upgrades seeing how\n1) they are applied when adding to world at the earliest (can be ignored if paradrop will be modified),\n2) prerequisites for each such upgrade need to be checked only once on creation and never again, as opposed to other global updates that need continuous checking?\n\nAnd, should a new trait be better suited, should it\n1) check prerequisites on creation (INotifyCreated) using the owning player's tech three (HasPrerequisites) and\n2a) call upgrade manager to grant upgrades definable in the YAML file\nor\n2b) call GainsExperience.GiveLevels or GainsExperience.GiveExperience with a certain amount of input from YAMLs?\n"
