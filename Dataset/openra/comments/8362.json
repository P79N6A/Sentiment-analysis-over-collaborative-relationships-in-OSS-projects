Orders are meant to be a code-level abstraction not seen by the user, and creating & managing them properly in a use case like this will probably be a pain.\n\nEDIT: maybe we can have a little bit more customization over the controls and allow for special macros, but I don't think exposing orders to the user is a good idea.\n"

    "body": "@penev92 no no no, the goal is to automate only the tasks you do repeatedly in specific situations, and only when you have to do them (and without missing any \"frame\" in the game when you do them because it would be automated). The game will never know when or where you want to move your construction yard, and if you don't react it will be destroyed.\nFor example, when you attack a base with a bunch of vehicles, you do your hit and run manually : A -> right-click -> A -> right-click -> A -> right-click ... (so the vehicles penetrate enemy defenses WHILE damaging everything, they always attack the units that are directly in front of them instead of continuing to fire on that building over there, they block production buildings, they leave husks in the base, and so on).\nLong games are sometimes a little bit painful (damaged desk, burning mouse, ...)\nOn the other hand I don't think any RTS allows custom orders like this and there is probably a reason. oO\n"
