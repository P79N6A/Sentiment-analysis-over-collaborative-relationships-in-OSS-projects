I agree that `Burst` needs to be renamed, but I think `BurstCount` would actually be better (we're not defining the number of salvos, but bursts here, afterall).\r\nInstead, I'd rather change the Descs to consistently use 'burst' instead of 'shot' and 'salvo' instead of 'ammo magazine' (which could be confused with ammo pools anyway).\r\nI'm not sold on using Salvo as term in those field names."

Shot / Salvo when used consistently leaves no room for confusion.  Using \"Burst\" for a single shot is just wrong."
