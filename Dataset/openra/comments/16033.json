    "body": "I also had the impression that \"Unit ready\" sound was playing less times than it should - I heard it ~once every 5 seconds even though I had a queue of 10 rifles. \r\n\r\nIt might produce problems when the sound file has some silence time in the end which will register as a playing sound and prevent repeating."
