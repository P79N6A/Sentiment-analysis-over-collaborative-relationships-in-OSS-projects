    "body": "> Yes, I meant attack anything. I forgot about the buildings part; the chasing part does not work.\r\n\r\nNot a problem with aircraft IMO.\r\n\r\n> It is already disabled for hold fire, hence my point about hold-fire being the default. Unless you mean the sticky targeting part?\r\n\r\nDon't know the terminology but this sounds like what I mean (that they will fire on a once targeted enemy unit when they get in range again ). If you can disable that, then I personally see no reason why not to enable opportunity fire / sticky targeting on other stances because it wouldn't change the current behavior but only add new features (in RA)."

Yaks could finally become a viable tool to attack blobs of infantry (well rocket soldiers still murder them) because you can now control the strafe with move orders while attacking and targeting works automatically. In situations where you need precision, you have hold fire and direct targeting like before. I like this a lot but let's see what others say."

It only adds new behaviour in the more aggresive stances that is in line with how stances work for other units (whereas up till now the more aggresive stances didn't function at all).
