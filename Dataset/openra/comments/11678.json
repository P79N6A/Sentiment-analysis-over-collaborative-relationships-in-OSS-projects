    "body": "Hopefully I can figure something out in that case. Likely not since I'm pretty unfamiliar with Linux overall, but you're right, this doesn't appear to be an issue with OpenRA specifically. It's just one of the victims.\n\nThank you for the responses, I appreciate it.\n\nI'll mention in response to GraionDilach that I only used Truecrypt for specific volume containers of miscellanious files - it was never used for the entire OS or for any of the other mentioned programs that aren't functioning properly.\n\nUPDATE: Simply going to add this in case someone in the future comes along looking for answers to a similar problem.\n\nIt was definitely an Ubuntu issue - my error messages started to rise in number, including generic \"Ubuntu has experienced a problem, report?\" ones. Then after another update it failed to launch entirely. I could no longer access the OS.\n\nI used an Ubuntu Live Disc (ironic, considering it's the OS that broke to begin with) to recover most of my files and wiped the drive. I'm now trying a different distribution of Linux called \"Linux Mint\" that seems to be working pretty well so far. I've reinstalled OpenRA on this OS and it works just fine.\n\nSo if you're running into problems like mine where apps fail to start with messages like \"problems with native code\" or \"bus error, core dumped\", look into it fast if you know how, or the entire OS might crumble around your ears.\n\nAt least now I can start playing again, heh. I was growing to miss it.\n\nCheers, folks.\n"
