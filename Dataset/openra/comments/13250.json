    "body": "This might already be within the scope of this but I figured I'd mention it anyway - I saw that when the AI loses all its refineries the AI won't sell any structures at all to get a new refinery, which isn't to mention any money tied up in production. I observed this happen relatively early in a game:\r\n\r\n![untitled2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2549088/32360945-be4455f8-c028-11e7-862a-919dd982bf2a.png)\r\n\r\nThe workaround suggested seems to be partly cognizant of this but, if the AI didn't have the money to begin with and no refineries specifically to sell, it might still have other structures to consider selling. I was considering creating another issue for it but it seems it would be mostly redundant."
