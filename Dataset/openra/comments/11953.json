I'm sick of shuffling hacks around that swap one undesirable edge case for another. \n\nIf someone doesn't want to take that task on this weekend then I think reverting the bits of #11393 that cause this is our only option.  We have far too many other improvements and fixes on bleed to justify holding up a release over that.\n"
