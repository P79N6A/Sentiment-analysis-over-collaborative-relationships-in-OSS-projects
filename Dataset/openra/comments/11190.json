    "body": "I (and maybe some other players too) don't expect current behavior from the restart function and rather reconfigure a skirmish match, which makes the function useless in the case. I don't want an easier match I just want to **try again** (btw, maybe a better label for the button) and I chose the random settings for a reason (so I must scout). If I'd want the game to restart with same setting I could still do that by choosing so in the settings (no random factions or positions). \n\nI'm guessing since the mechanics to randomize the factions and positions are already in place, this would be a ~simple (guessing) improvement.\n\nWhile I doubt the current behaviour is a genre's standard, \"breaking\" it would just improve the game and maybe stand out a good way...\n"
