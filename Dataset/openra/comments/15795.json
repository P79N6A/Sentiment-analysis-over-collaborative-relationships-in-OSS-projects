    "body": "I think the idea was to use a language that does not need to be compiled, so scripts can easily be distributed together with custom maps. Allowing anyone to add their own dlls and reference/execute them from maps sounds like a security risk to me.\r\n\r\n(Looking it up I just found https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2292#issuecomment-12283930, https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/2067 and https://forum.openra.net/viewtopic.php?f=83&t=15510 if anyone is interested in digging around in OpenRA's history. ^^)"

    "body": "Thanks for kindly show me the OpenRA's history. I read through the threads you sent me.\r\nSecurity is a concern. It would not be easy to overcome. The other thing it is fun to integrate a script engine to a program. Many years ago, I was thinking how to integrate a javascript engine to our VoIP phone system at work. However, that never be a high priority project for us. In OpenRA's source code, it demonstrates how to accomplish it. It took me a couple hours of debugging and finally I slowly understand the logic and the linkage between the C# object and lua engine.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I think the distribution for the script files in OpenRa can be just .cs along with the custom map files. When OpenRa about to load the map, it could invoke .net runtime's csc.exe to compile .cs file to dll on demand and load to memory.\r\n\r\nI was trying to demonstrate to my son (who is a 10th grader) how to modify these lua files to add multiple Tanya(s) in the game. I was thinking if the script were in C#, it would be much easier to create a more complicated  game rules. After all, visual studio's debugger is very powerful compare to other script language. I could also teach my son some C# programming. He is very interested on creating his own map, but don't want to learn computer languages. LOL.\r\n\r\nAnyway, OpenRa is really a nice and fun project. Great job for everyone on this project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "
