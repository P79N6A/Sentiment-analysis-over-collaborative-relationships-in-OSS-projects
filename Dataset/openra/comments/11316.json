    "body": "Some issues I noticed during my first playthrough:\n- You can see following units but will never be able to get their prerequisites: Gap Generator, Chronosphere, Iron Curtain, Missile Silo, M.A.D Tank, MiG, Longbow, Missile Sub\n- An exception from above is the Flamethrower. You can - in theory - get the required prerequisite by capturing a flame tower... I think here we should just make flame towers buildable.\n- Just minor: It feels a bit weird that Heavy Tanks require a service depot and Medium Tanks don't.\n- Einstein has the same selection priority as normal soldiers while the engineer has not, this is somehow confusing imho.\n- If you play alone you get \"Mission Accomplished\", but the game just continues.\n- Just for bonus points: I had to search a bit before I found the flare and the helicopter I need to send Einstein to. What about placing a beacon there?\n- To \"That also means that the difficulty is quite high [...]\": Well, not too, imho. It was quite easy to snipe ever soldier with tanya as they don't come for you like they do in the allies03 missions, you could add that for extra bonus points. :D\n"
