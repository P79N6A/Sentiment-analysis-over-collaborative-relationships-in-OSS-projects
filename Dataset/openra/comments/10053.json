If anything not having a tech building is a set back as all the enemy needs to do it capture or destroy your production facility and then you cant produce units at all until you build a new one then tech it up again. There are games were you would purchase the tech building multiple times, making it the tech center more of an active upgrade building rather than building once and just protecting it. This was only for high level play though, most players never sold their buildings.\nI still feel it isnt really a bug if it manages to survive ~5 years. And from using it, i feel it was more of a feature that assisted in adding some strategy to Tiberium Sun multiplayer.\n"
