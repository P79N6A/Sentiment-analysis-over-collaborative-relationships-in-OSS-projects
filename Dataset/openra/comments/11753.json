MonoDevelop tries to adhere to the Visual Studio format anyway so I am okay that current VS is the standard. Also not much to argue about such minor changes. :+1: \n\nWhat I would like to see in the future is automatic code formatting on file save instead of manually fiddling with the code to make StyleCop happy. I guess that information is also stored in the .csproj files. Hopefully we can get something that works everywhere here.\n"
