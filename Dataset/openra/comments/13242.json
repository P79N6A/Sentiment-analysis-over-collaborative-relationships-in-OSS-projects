    "body": "> they don't return based on ReturnOnIdle\r\n\r\nThat's not quite correct, they actually do. For example, they return to base after killing their target, even when they still have ammo left. The reason they don't RTB after a move command is because of the special handling in the `Aircraft` trait for those cases.\r\n\r\nThis special handling could (and should, IMO) be removed with this change, before it gets merged.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm not quite sure if we should take this change. For one, there is pchote's argument that planes were originally supposed to behave differently than helicopters, and it also increases the need for micro-management for aircraft for no real reason or gain (other than the 'pressing F and S does the same for aircraft' from #12487).\r\n\r\nI guess it's time to properly come up with a game plan how we want aircraft to behave. The one thing I don't quite like about pchote's vision is that it removes the option to 'park' aircraft somewhere and prepare an ambush. On the other hand, I would welcome a game mechanic that would limit the time for which aircraft could be parked liked that. Maybe that's a reasonable compromise between the two extremes."
