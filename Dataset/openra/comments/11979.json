    "body": "Been playing the playtest a lot, and I stand with my contention that helos auto re targeting after reload behavior is not good. However, there were issue with the way they reloaded and takeoff before so I understand why you wanted to change it, just think you went a step too far. I think you/we should focus this bugfix for aircraft behavior to the following points:\n- When sending helos out on attack move Alt+A towards an enemy targets, they eventually stop reloading and just loop back and forth. I think this has to do with the helos not knowing which pad they needed to land on. I THINK you fixed this.\n- Mechanic behavior is BROKEN, they have a hard time healing nearby helos because they do not IDLE. When on the pad, the pad should show the reloading animation, and the helo rotors should slow down. Also, if helos takeoff immediately after reloading, then mechanics may not have enough time to repair them. This prevents the F shortcut from forcing them to land and get repaired.\n- If you are going to experiment with automatically resuming attack, it should be limited to the players immediate line of sight. It shouldn't follow units into the fog, even with GPS up. I will admit this might be useful for base defense. In reality, Alt+A shortcut already provided this kind of behavior.\n- AI Hinds seem to want to target my Hinds, even though they can't fire air-to-air. I can lure all kinds of enemy hinds to my base with this cheat/trick.\n"
