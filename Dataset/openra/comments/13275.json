    "body": "realy, in c&c3 I only used hold position on venoms, when I wanted to make a chain of them to use the laser reflector. Imho ALL the cnc games did a bad job with the stances, the menue in RA3 I think was a roll out menue with tiny buttons. Basicaly you had to learn the hotkey. In openRA I only think of stances with dogs(instant hotkey x 1) and subs (instant hotkey x 3) and forget about it afterwards.\r\n\r\nIm not sure if the cycling solution of openRA is better, opposed to setting a fixed stance on a hotkey. No rts I know displays the stance with the actor however. It is not that important. Most the time it is part of the general UI, mixed button/display. So i disagree that there should be symbols on the actors. too much clutter. (See those [1](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nenIGqQuL4M/Ui3RiCSeSpI/AAAAAAAAAPs/16NFkNvd0D4/s1600/Age+of+Empires+2+The+Age+of+Kings+Screenshot+1.jpg),[2](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nenIGqQuL4M/Ui3RiCSeSpI/AAAAAAAAAPs/16NFkNvd0D4/s1600/Age+of+Empires+2+The+Age+of+Kings+Screenshot+1.jpg),[3](http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/501436-command-conquer-red-alert-3-uprising-windows-screenshot-using.jpg),[4](http://www.dlcompare.com/img/warcraft3-screenshot-2.jpg),[5](http://www.dlcompare.com/upload/gameimage/file/10105.jpeg) RTS and their stance menues, only [AOE2 ](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nenIGqQuL4M/Ui3RiCSeSpI/AAAAAAAAAPs/16NFkNvd0D4/s1600/Age+of+Empires+2+The+Age+of+Kings+Screenshot+1.jpg)and CnC3 do a decent job)\r\n\r\nIf we want to be avant-garde with this it has to be very subtle. (->colored selection box)\r\nOR put those symbols into the side menue somehow, current stance highlighted, click-able, like most rts do. I hope this was clear.."

This then naturally wraps up the planned work and avoids all the issues that come with per-unit decorations.\r\n\r\ne.g. from C&C3:\r\n<img width=\"550\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-05-26 at 18 37 56\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/167819/26506088/2c55ab78-4243-11e7-8ca9-68491b64759c.png\">\r\n\r\nThe four right-most buttons map to HoldFire / ReturnFire / Defend / AttackAnything, and are highlighted based on the stances of the selected units.\r\n\r\nThis is another very-long planned feature (e.g. #3789 and linked tickets) that has never gone anywhere mainly because people wanted to scope-creep it into a dynamic order palette.  I'm suggesting that we officially give up on that idea, and instead duplicate the fixed C&C3 bar with buttons for our three primary order generators (force-move, attack-move, guard) and the four stances.\r\n\r\nThis is something i'm prepared to implement myself once the other high-priority half-finished features for the next release are done."

    "body": "> This is another very-long planned feature (e.g. #3789 and linked tickets) that has never gone anywhere mainly because people wanted to scope-creep it into a dynamic order palette. I'm suggesting that we officially give up on that idea, and instead duplicate the fixed C&C3 bar with buttons for our three primary order generators (force-move, attack-move, guard) and the four stances.\r\n\r\nStuff like an attack ground option will be needed longterm - see the discussion in #11663. This sounds like another made-up issue like \"fragile alliances are wrong\"."
