    "body": "Another issue regarding pillboxes is the resale value doesn't account for the rifleman inside. Every other base defense has a 50% chance of either a rifle or a civilian when you sell, but the pillbox at any health level always gives you the rifle inside and possibly ranked. The pillbox resale value should be reduced to properly compensate for the included rifleman that you get to keep.\r\n-This can be done by adding customsellvalues to the new $600 & $800 pillboxes:\r\nPBOX:\r\n+CustomSellValue:\r\n++Value: 400\r\n\r\nHBOX:\r\n+CustomSellValue:\r\n++Value: 600\r\n\r\nExplanation:\r\nPBOX CustomSellValue @$400 = 200 refund + $100 rifle (50% of $600)\r\nHBOX CustomSellValue @$600 = 300 refund + $100 rifle (50% of $800)\r\n\r\nWith the ability of the pillboxes damaged or not to offer a rifleman 100% of the time + the ability of ranked infantry. These resale values should be a better representation their real value."

    "body": "This is from a post of October 27 2016. I couldn't find the thread post on the forums about allied defenses but I will leave my thoughts here.\r\n\r\nTD Guard tower takes 24 seconds to build at 600$ pricing. power of 10. It fires only one volley:\r\n\r\nGuard tower:\r\n\r\nReload Delay: 25\r\nSpread: 683\r\nDamage: 30\r\n\r\nVersus armor types:\r\n\r\nNone: 100\r\nWood: 50\r\nLight: 70\r\nHeavy: 30\r\n\r\nRA Pillbox takes 10 seconds to build at price 400$. C.Pillbox takes 15 seconds at 600$. Both at a power of 15. They both fire six volleys:\r\n\r\nReload Delay: 30\r\nSpread: 128\r\nDamage: 10 (60 after volley)\r\n\r\nVersus armor types:\r\n\r\nNone: 200\r\nWood: 50\r\nLight: 60\r\nHeavy: 25\r\nConcrete: 25 (I didn't know they did concrete damage.)\r\n\r\nWith them firing volleys in six shots it reduces the damage over all to armor vehicles in compared to a straight 60 damage.\r\n\r\n10 damage of 25 heavy = 12 damage.\r\n\r\n60 damage of 25 heavy = 15 damage. (Unless my math sucks which is known to happen.)\r\n\r\nThey do not switch targets after a unit dies however. (IE: After 3 shots kill an infantry the other 3 are shot at the ground. Then targest a new target for the full 6 shots)\r\n\r\nBest fix is to raise the build time. I would test that and leave the price alone. Many times you can kill a pillbox box but in general circumstances you have 5-6 seconds of free killing time before another pops up."
