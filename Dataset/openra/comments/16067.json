    "body": "Updated to remove the target-invalidation when `AttackFollow.AttackActivity` is cancelled, and restore the hacks in `AutoTarget` that it was supposed to replace.  Turns out that this code was what supported our current limited tank kiting abilities.\r\n\r\nWe can safely remove the hacks when fixing #14009 - desired behaviour will be maintained if `AttackFollow.AttackActivity`'s `IsCancelled` branch can switch the `requestedTarget` over to `opportunityTarget` first before invalidating `requestedTarget`."
