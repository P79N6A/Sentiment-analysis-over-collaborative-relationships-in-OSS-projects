    "body": "Explaining some of [Missile.cs](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Effects/Missile.cs#L24) for context:\n\n`MaximumLaunchSpeed` - Missiles are launched at this speed. In heightmap enabled mods this varies depending on a height difference, which may use `MinimumLaunchSpeed`.\n`MaximumSpeed` - Highest speed the missile can attain. The default is `384` and all missiles currently have this value.\n`Acceleration` - Under certain conditions the missile will [change speed](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Effects/Missile.cs#L398) to reach its target. The default acceleration results in changes of `+/-5`.\n\nSo speedup results from `Accceleration` and `MaximumSpeed`. Acceleration really kicks in often when altitude shifts. If rockets are being targeted against ground units they may change speed just `0-4` times. Airborne rockets on the other hand (any of destroyers', since they arc, or rocket soldier anti-air) accelerate extremely fast.\n- Destroyer AG/AA accelerates from [`170`](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/mods/ra/weapons/missiles.yaml#L296)/[`255`](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/mods/ra/weapons/missiles.yaml#L336) to  `~250`/`384 (max)`.\n- Rocket soldier AG/AA accelerates from [`213`](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/mods/ra/weapons/missiles.yaml#L46)/[`298`](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/mods/ra/weapons/missiles.yaml#L232) to `~213-240`/`384 (max)`.\n\n---\n\nI'm not convinced on the magical maximum speed value all missiles now have. If we look at tweaking individual missiles to explode faster, it's bogus that a (maximum launch speed) missile can boost itself +100 in a second, so acceleration and/or max speed still needs a visit. It makes sense in TS where the missile can be launched at a slower speed.\n"

    "body": "In my opinion, `MaximumSpeed` should be slightly refactored to be `MaximumAddedSpeed`, and internally max speed should then be `MinimumSpeed` + `MaximumAddedSpeed`. This would have several advantages, \n1) by default, the difference between minimum and maximum speed would be the same for all missiles,\n2) the risk of modders accidentally setting a `MinimumSpeed` higher than `MaximumSpeed` would disappear,\n3) we could set the internal default of `MaximumAddedSpeed` to `0`, meaning min speed = max speed, which is a much saner default for our shipping mods.\n\nEdit: I'm not convinced of the name `MaximumAddedSpeed`, feel free to make a better suggestion.\n"
