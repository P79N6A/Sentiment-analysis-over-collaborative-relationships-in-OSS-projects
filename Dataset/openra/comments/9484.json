Are you maybe immediately calling `actor.Stop()` after `actor.Scatter()`? Then the move to the neighbor cell would be canceled.\n"

Unfortunately, Scatter() working properly 99.9999% of the time is not quite good enough, because it requires the application of hacks to make it work in cases when you specifically _need_ those BunchaGuys to clear the area.\n\nMeanwhile, it has been suggested that the canceled move order might be related to #5968. If that is the case, could someone suggest a sensible workaround until this gets addressed?\n"
