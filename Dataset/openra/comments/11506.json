    "body": "I also did a quick search. Westwood Studios didn't submit any patent claims and you also can't patent a whole file format, but rather inventions that are used in compression formats. As the SHP compression is mostly prior art anyway that doesn't apply. You also can't copyright a file format, but you can own the rights of a documentation describing it and your initial implementation is subject to copyright, but not the idea and concept behind it. Creating an incompatible derivative doesn't improve the legal situation and certainly doesn't help with modding.\n\nhttps://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/OpenRA.Game/FileFormats/BlowfishKeyProvider.cs#L17 is one of the few code parts where I guess intellectual property is at least debatable. It looks to be converted from assembler language into C, but it already received several cleanups so it probably isn't identical to the original Westwood library. We never had access to official specifications nor the original source code, so there is no risk of this being a direct copy. There might be valid reason for a rewrite or improvement of existing file format parts to increase readability, compression effectiveness and ease maintenance. Legal affairs isn't a matter here.\n"
