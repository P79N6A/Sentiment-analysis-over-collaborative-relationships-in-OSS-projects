The project is no longer one giant mess (well there are smaller messes in it, but those are totally different). Six months ago the solution was pretty horrific. We finally have a well-structured project architecture.\n2. I was thinking people need to be made aware that the solution is not as horrible any more months ago. [This post](http://www.ppmsite.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=525111#525111) just confirms my point.\n"
