    "body": "A GPS nerf is certainly something on the mind of the competitive community at the moment. One of the suggestions so far is to have GPS only reveal positions to the player and not provide vision to the player's units, so that artillery, Tanya, etc. won't auto fire into the fog of war at dots. \r\nThis coupled with Blunt's idea could be a worthwhile trade-off."
