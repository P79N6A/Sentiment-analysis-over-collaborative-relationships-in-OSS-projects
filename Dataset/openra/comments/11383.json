    "body": "All problems we've had with `PoisonedByTiberium` so far stem from the fact that it fires a weapon instead of directly applying damage.\n\nIn my opinion, we should consider to get at least `UpgradeOnTerrain` from #11380 merged, use it to enable a `SelfHealing` trait that actually reduces health (or really heals in case of cyborgs and mutants) on actors when they're on tiberium/veins terrain, and kill off `PoisonedByTiberium` entirely.\n\nThe vein attack animation can be done via an overlay on the attacked actor itself, which would also be enabled by `UpgradeOnTerrain`. That way we'd also get TS-style constant looping of the vein attack anim, instead of that somewhat dodgy looking warhead effect every few ticks.\n"
