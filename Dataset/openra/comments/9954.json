    "body": "Pause for thought: I kind of like this (not seeing infantry on GPS). \n\nIt gives soviets a limited way of being sneaky late game. Allies currently have _such_ an easy time slaughtering infantry (tanya, hinds, arty, PBs) that this 'element of surprise' might give soviets a small window of opportunity to do some damage with these poor cannon fodder late game and open up some interesting diversionary tactics. \n\nA couple longbows at this level provide loads of LoS so its not exactly overpowered and seeing infantry from a WW2 satellite orbiting in space always seems a little _too_ good even for the RA fantasy universe.\n\nBut obviously implemented as a feature and not a bug. Discuss.\n"
