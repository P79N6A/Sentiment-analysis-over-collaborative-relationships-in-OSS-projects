    "body": "Maybe divide the map into polygons (keep a representation for every movement type) and A\\* through those, caching the two best paths per start-poly/end-poly combo, and noting if moving from one to the other is impossible (for example, if you're trying to send a tank from mainland to an island only accessible by boat, or try to send a ship on land). I've also been considering maintaining a polygonal representation of the map for a different reason: using raytraces to pathfind instead of A*. Of course, that's a bit newer territory than traditional node-based pathfinding algorithms, but from my understanding, it should scale a bit better on larger maps, assuming it isn't constantly running into obstacles. Still haven't put together a testing suite so I can see how workable these ideas are.\n"
