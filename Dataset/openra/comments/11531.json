It still is fun thing to have, combined with GPS loss etc.\n"

The role of the shroud is discovery and casual players are coming in for the fun. It's something that is there that rewards you for exploring. It's satisfying to wipe away the dark with units. Defaulting explored map would take this away from a lot of players that don't consider tactics or strategy. Big mistake IMO.\n"
