I think that a tooltip would not bring that much value because this is information that has to be available at a glance -- without requiring input from the user.

In this case, the ability to show information for all queued items IMO outweighs the fact that you need to hover to see it - you already know what you are interested in, and the information is only one action away.\r\n\r\nIts not clear to me (but i'm happy to be convinced otherwise) why it is necessary for the next item to be available passively."

At the moment you have to cancel b for that. the \"Next\" indicator helps with this problem when you have a large queue and don't remember the order. An even bigger change but in line with the idea behind this would be to add an input for \"Next\" so that you don't have to remove items from the queue.
