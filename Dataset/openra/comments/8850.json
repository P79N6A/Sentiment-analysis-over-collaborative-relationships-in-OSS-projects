    "body": "Hmm, at first I didn't like the idea at all, but after some thought this may be a good solution for easier re-using. We should keep the namespaces for context of the very specialized traits which have less value for reuse and shouldn't be generalized. The argument for having separate DLLs is to avoid loading everything, but as the `Mods.Common` library is the largest anyway, it probably won't matter performance wise. Splitting everything in `Activities.dll`, `Traits.dll` etc. makes no sense either, because then you again need to reference everything and just refactored for nothing.\n"
