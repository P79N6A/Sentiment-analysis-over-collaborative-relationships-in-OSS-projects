    "body": "What I suspect is that we have an initialization order issue here. I can imagine that this happens because the render traits need to be loaded after `Building`, but we can't make `WithSpriteBody` require `Building` for obvious reasons.\n\nIn other words, we probably need #8848 to fix this.\n\nEdit: `WithSpriteBody` works fine, it appears `WithWallSpriteBody` is broken.\n"
