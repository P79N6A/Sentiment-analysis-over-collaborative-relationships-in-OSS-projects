    "body": "> As an idea for a new game mode, I think a 'Destruction` mode where the value of killed units is counted towards a player's score could be interesting. Players would need to think about whether they want to employ expensive powerful units, or weaker but cheaper ones. This game mode would need a score limit, changeable in the lobby.\n\nThis would tie in nicely with #10358\n\n> There are two problems I don't have a solution for yet with that scheme:\n\nI have (had for a long time) a plan to unhardcode the map options and automatically generate the contents of the player bin based on traits implementing new `ILobbyCheckboxOption` and `ILobbyDropdownOption` interfaces.  One day I might get around to writing my ideas down as a ticket or as a PR.  The implementing trait can then do whatever it wants, including granting an upgrade that could toggle VictoryConditions.\n"

    "body": ":+1: I agree we need more modes.\n\n@cjshmyr's 'sole survivor' project could become a dedicated mode rather than being lumped into the minigame category. (although I don't know hambs ultimate plan for this)\n\nLikewise a 'wave' mode (similar to fort lonestart) could  become a dedicated mode. Infinite levels with each level being harder with a level counter at the top of the screen. Tiebreaker would simply be $ worth of units killed.\n\nI would however push for a standardised UI and rule set used across maps for each individual mode which would inherit the vanilla rules. This way the UI and rules would only have to be changed in one place but would affect all maps of that game mode.\n\nI think this would create consistency and lessen confusion for newer players. Currently you can build the same unit across all the different minigames and that unit will have a _completely_ different set of attributes depending on the minigame. Not only is this confusing but it is forcing the player to **learn an entirely new set of attributes for each unit - for each individual game mode - as well as the game mode itself**. \n\nImho the goal should be to learn and enjoy the strategies unique to each game mode but with the vanilla units and abilities - using the knowledge gained elsewhere in the mod. Map terrain, enemy unit composition and tech levels should be the interesting variables that differentiate individual maps. A V2 in a minigame should act like a V2 in the default C&C mode. It should be up to the player how to counter it depending on the game mode.\n\nTo add variation of course, unique and boss units can be added - as long as they are visually different to the existing units in the game. Then you can go nuts.\n"
