However, in d2k, there's a key that does nothing (`R` for the Defense queue), another key makes you jump back up the row (the Tank queue (`O`) comes before the Aircraft queue (`U`)). \n\nI think a generally more flexible approach would be to assign slots to each of the buttons and then  bind the keys not to the type of queue but to the slot it occupies. That would solve both the gaps and the jumping back and forth.\n"
