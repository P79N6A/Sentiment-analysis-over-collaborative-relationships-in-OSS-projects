You can read all about it in the PR that removed it: #10650.\n\nFWIW, I'm fine with adding it back if someone figures out a way to implement it in a way that actually works. We did the same thing with left-click orders, for example.\n\nBut I'm not going to let a ticket that starts off like that be a precedent. It's fine that you want that feature back, but I'm sure you can communicate that in a civil way.\n"
