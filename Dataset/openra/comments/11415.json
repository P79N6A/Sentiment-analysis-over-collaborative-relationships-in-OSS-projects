Seeing as an Obelisk takes 3 shots to kill a mammoth I would prefer it to have the one charge shot setup. (Specially since a lot of vehicles get one shot as it is.)\n\nThe 1 charge style is the draw back for it to be overwhelmed quite true. But the problem is the charge up and targeting system itself. When the unit dies it resets the charge without firing a shot and has to recharge up again before it can fire. This makes the Obelisk a lot weaker and is very easily overwhelmed more so then I would like.\n"
