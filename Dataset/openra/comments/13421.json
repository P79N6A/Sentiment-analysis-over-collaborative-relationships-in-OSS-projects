My proposition is to leave the build menu at the exact state it is when deploying the MCV, further more if you want: if there is no build menu then default to the buildings one (when deploying the very first MCV).\r\n\r\nFurthermore weighing in the values: you have 1 time benefit at the very start which might not be that important (also that is the only available menu since the game just started so it makes sense to show the buildings menu) versus a benefit that can come in handy any time during a play.\r\n\r\nImagine a new scenario:  you have the Vehicles queue and you are selecting the vehicles you want and in between you deploy a MCV and now you have to do an extra move to switch back to the queue you were just a second ago."
