    "body": "I realized Debian/Ubuntu's APT does not depend on either wget or curl as dependencies and running `apt remove wget curl` on them doesn't cause apt or any other core package to appear in the list of packages to be removed so I'm not certain that they come with curl or wget pre-installed, although I think wget does come pre-installed. The upshot of it is that I added wget to the dependency install command just in case.\r\n\r\nEDIT1: For the other distros either curl or wget are dependencies of their respective package manager so at least one of them must come pre-installed. \r\n\r\nEDIT2: Sorry @Mailaender for editing after your stale review. I honestly thought wget was a core component of Debian/Ubuntu, but I am not so certain now, so it seems safe to just include it in the dependency install command for these distros, just in case. "
