You can use the Asset Browser (under the Extras menu in the game) to view the frames and take note of frame numbers.\r\n\r\nYou shouldn't need to worry about the pixel offsets for fixing these issues, they come from knowing how D2K internally managed its coordinate systems (e.g. buildings were renderered relative to their bottom-left corner, tanks from their center, etc) compared to OpenRA (everything is rendered relative to their center).  The ZOffset is what you'll want to change for fixing the render order, and is measured in world units (1024 = 1 cell) and for the factories generally want to be set to whatever their roof offsets are + 1 to make sure they go on top."

I changed the `ZOffset` of the top part of the factories to `895` if it is `511` outcoming vehicles overlap with the structure sometimes (Devastator). \r\n    * Should this value be a multiplicate of 32? __Don't have to but it makes cleaner numbers__\r\n    * Can this be done better? If I keep the top part at `1023` and the welding light at `1024` not all of the welding lights can be seen. Is there some kind of guideline?\r\n\r\n2. The welding lights are quite structured:\r\n    * First `x` frames are for Atreides\r\n    * Then `x` for Harkonnen \r\n    * Last `x` for Ordos\r\n\r\n__However__, the welding lights for the heavy factory consists of 47 frames, first 30 frames are for the factions and I choose the next 10 frames for the mercenaries heavy factory (which I don't know how to test) but I have no idea what the purpose of the last 7 frames is. I mean to recognize a heavy Harkonnen factory but in my opinion there are no frames missing for them. So I wouldn't use them!\r\n\r\nIf concerns about these points are cleared, I would create a pull request."
