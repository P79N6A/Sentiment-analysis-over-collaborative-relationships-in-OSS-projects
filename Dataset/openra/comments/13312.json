I think that has something to do with desync.\r\n\r\nThis is the replay with desync.\r\n[desync.zip](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/files/1007749/desync.zip)\r\n[syncreport-2017-05-17T124704Z.zip](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/files/1007750/syncreport-2017-05-17T124704Z.zip)\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce, including game setup\r\nhttps://youtu.be/wjrK-XYjD3E\r\nAt the end, the game desyncs and terminates, the video ends."
