    "body": "Congrats on your first PR! Trust me if you're a git nub like then errors will never stop coming. Just keep going.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I was pinged here by @Smittytron on IRC but as for the changes I don't have the sufficient experience with them in order to weigh in.\r\n\r\nStill, I'm curious, regarding the $1600 WF, why the need to pull back the delay effect of the second MCV? The +8s build time increase (still $2000) was put in place precisely to tax players for early expanding vs army builds so what's the incentive for normalizing it?\r\n\r\nI had some limited exposure to a MCV speed reduction of 85->71 (speed of Heavy Tank) and I really enjoyed that and I'd wager a MCV speed reduction will eventually become reality but as with _all_ play-testing done the past few months I've been extra careful advocating for them. This is why I cross-checked the play-testing done between us on #12739 regarding the most recent play-tested balance changes.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind I'm influenced heavily by #11995 and #12013 after spending an enormous amount of neuron capital breaking the ice on RA's game balancing that enables play-testing (among other principles) to go more efficiently balance PRs. So to the extent which I might weigh in on future balance PR's (with exception of my personal bias and style) you'll know where I'm coming from.\r\n\r\n*With this PR closed, remade or not, that'd be my comment on this issue."
