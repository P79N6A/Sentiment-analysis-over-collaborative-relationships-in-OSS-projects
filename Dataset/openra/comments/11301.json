    "body": "No. :-1: \n\nFor two reasons:\n1. I said from the start that I was only ok with the existence of https://github.com/OpenRA/ra2  as long as it doesn't cause work for us (which you very well know, so I really find this PR offensive). This change means that pull requests for ra2 will end up on our main repo, which will definitely cause work and even worse, distractions from our more immediate goals. We already have a hard enough time reviewing all PRs on this repo, this will just make matters worse.\n2. I don't see why ra2 has to be the special snow flake that needs to live upstream while a number of other third-party mods do just fine without.\n\nIt is now clear to me that allowing https://github.com/OpenRA/ra2 to be created was completely wrong, sent the wrong signal and should have been prevented. The same is probably true for https://github.com/OpenRA/d2. I'm sorry now for taking such a laissez-faire approach and not a more active stance against it when the issue came up half a year ago.\n"

    "body": "@obrakmann: I wouldn't go that harsh with words over there, calling a probably good step in the right direction a bad one. https://github.com/OpenRA/ra2/issues/208 explains the reasons behind this PR (albeit I acknowledge and agree with declining it). The sole reason why thirdparty mods atm work is because all thirdparty modders deal with the release issues on their own and probably not try to automate a release (best example: @reaperrr compiled/uploaded a TDX release manually ffrom what I saw to GitHub).\n\nThe true solution to this problem would be (notsure how feasible this is, because I lack the required knowledge of .gitignore and makefiles) something like to make gitignoring a lot more explicit (ignore any mod folders which are not OpenRA-supported both in C# - since thirdparty libraries already follw the OpenRA naming convention with OpenRA.Mods.RA2/D2/AS/TDX - and within the mods, with only tracking cnc, d2k, modchooser, ra, and ts folder there) and somehow rewriting the makefile to be scripted to notice all additional all mod code projects without the c'n'p tricks it has to rely on atm.\n\nIf commits like https://github.com/GraionDilach/OpenRA/commit/97b0f450d4c82ddf0e933ce77c5e5139f2502af5 wouldn't be required to ensure automated compilation (NB: I'm not asking for the solution expansion nor the code check aspect) then the issues this PR meant to solve can be solved without upstream interference.\n"

The RA2 mod has adopted an \"upstream or bust\" philosophy, and other mods (like AS, CD, SP) try to work within the current limitations without giving feedback on the issues or how to improve things.\n\nThe IRC logs have multiple discussion fragments where I have tried to kickstart mod makefiles that treat the engine as an automatic dependency, but nobody (okay... really just the RA2 mod, since the other modders are never around) is interested.\n"

    "body": "It turned out the problem you were trying to solve with keeping dependencies in mod.yaml isn't such a big issue. The main problem was building the OpenRA.Mod.RA2.dll without OpenRA. The copied or linked dependencies worked, but aren't redistributable. Linking static DLLs causes `TypeLoadExceptions` in the OpenRA engine, see https://github.com/OpenRA/ra2/issues/208 and many people have problems setting up their development environment so git submodules seems to be the easiest way to automate that. I agree that the monolithic structure of the OpenRA project is far from optimal. It has to change at some point.\n"

Complete forks are IMO the worst overhead possible and the RA2 mod already had that path as well in Phrohdoh/OpenRA.\n- I amn't certain what would be the ideal solution nor I am the best modder to provide feedback in terms of mod support, since I am too much of an adjuster by nature. I just know that right now my environment setup (which I converted SP as well weeks ago) works well for me, and only has the overhead of running separate repositories in the same folder, with only rebasing a single commit all the time against upstream - something I am completely fine myself. What I can tell at this point that so far to me, the new mod supporting ideas - like .oramod - are helpful when releasing a mod, but doesn't seem much useful when developing one.\n- In any cases, I am planning to return to IRC to somehow give modding support feedback, however lately, I've grinded my PC to a halt (due to some RL reasons) and while I already ordered a new PC (mostly because I had fed up with my GPU performance and the lag resulted from it, which was the main reason why the IRC feedback considered that one AS stream catastrophic back then), it's already two weeks late in deliver and even today I have no idea when I actually will get my hands on it and I don't intend to return to active OpenRA discussions beyond PR reviewing until that computer arrives.\n"

For releasing mods you would obviously not use this, and instead you should be packaging an oramod that is built against a release-tagged engine version.\n"

Should have checked it out beforehand I go against it. :S \n\n@pchote: Up til today, the RA2 mod actually followed the system your second IRC snippet intended albeit crudely (without automating the things). I have a rough guess how to interpret your project setup:\n\n```\n/RA2/ (this would be the \"support\" dir, which has it's own solution, makefile and whatnot, to compile everything in it's /OpenRA/ subfolder, also supplying bats/whatnot to launch /OpenRA.Game.exe with the support dir override)\n/RA2/OpenRA (this would be the OpenRA dir which would be forced to take .. as support)\n```\n\nIs this really how would it look like though? By shifting all edited coming-from-upstream files a folder above with the structure and then taking them from a relative path during compiling?\n"

The key points are that (1) it is a directory that is understood to be owned and managed by the mod's makefile and treated as a thirdparty dependency and (2) that it is a known path so that you can reference the binaries from your ra2 project files.\n\nYou then build your makefile commands to automatically manage that self-contained engine version based on metadata that you define for the RA2 mod.  I've been suggesting that you use the mod.yaml dependency line so that you only need to set the upstream version in one place, but that appears to have caused at least some confusion.\n\nYou then modify the upstream engine code to define some way to run your self-contained engine copy with an arbitrary mod path, either by setting the support directory, overloading the Game.Mod parsing to accept a path as well as an ID, or any other solution that works for you.\n"

There aren't enough manpower to fully finish TS and D2k at the moment either, broadening the main project at this point is beyond the capacity. The RA2 project should stay third-party to decrease the wandering and let upstream concentrate to the upstream aims.\n\nBesides that, RA2 is pledged with enough legal issues as-is already.\n\nTLDR: You have no idea what you're talking about so it's better if you'd just drop the topic, thank you.\n"
