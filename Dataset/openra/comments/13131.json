    "body": "A classic mode has requested and some tried to make in the past (iirc never released). But the idea got ditched out as it is nearly impossible to do, becuase how some game logics act different than original games. You can change every single value to match the original but still can't get the same.\r\n\r\nMaking engineers able to capture full health structures is i think just a 1-line .yaml change. But that's not the only thing OpenRA mods different that originals. RA and TD mod are highly rebalanced with the time. For D2K mod and future TS mod, our plan for now is to stick with original gameplay, but of course those will get balance changes after they are properly completed.\r\n\r\nOpenRA mods are not clones of original games. Having a better balance is one of the aims of it."
