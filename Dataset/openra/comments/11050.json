    "body": "Although @pchote  confirmed this as a bug, I think that:\n- **thesla coils SHOULD be able to shoot over walls** since they are **significantly taller** than walls and other defense structures.\n\n(Original game / missions also seem to promote this idea: Look at the tesla coil placement in the Tanya's Tale map for example: http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/cnc/images/a/a2/CNCRA_Tanyas_Tale_1.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100116105850 )\n- Walls **blocking fire from shock troopers and tesla tanks seems fine to me.**\n\nI think that the argument \"Allies don't have a similar defensive structure\" is not to be considered since we probably want diversity to make the game more interesting.\n"
