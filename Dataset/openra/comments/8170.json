    "body": "Hi @DSUK, and welcome!\n\nThis looks like a good start, but will need some more refinements before we can consider merging this:\n- Like @Mailaender mentioned, the changes that don't directly relate to this feature will need to be reverted, and the installer will need to detect and install from both the original disks and TFD.\n- The code style inside `InstallShieldCABExtractor` fails our [coding standard](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/Coding-Standard) verification, and will need to be reformatted.  You can look at the output of the travis builds or run `make check` locally to see the list of violations.\n- The `InstallShieldCABExtractor` code looks to be translated from another language / project.  What license was this originally released under?  It must be GPLv3 compatible for us to be able to include it.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any questions about how to work through these points.\n"

As an update i am working on getting the CAB extractor to implement IFolder.\nI would like to ask how are the classic hashes used? and would a hash collision be a issue if one was to  occur?\n\nand @GraionDilach I have no idea where the second T has come from. I will amend accordingly :)\n"

    "body": "The two hash methods are there as kludges to support the westwood mix formats, which don't include any filename metadata but only the classic hashes (TD/RA) or CRCs (TS/RA2).\n\nAs a general note: the filesystem code is full of technical debt and has fundamental limitations because of the constraints of the mix format.  There have been discussions and long-term plans about having the installer repackage the mixes into a more sensible format so that we can then replace the filesystem layer with something more sensible.  With this and #8119 that idea is again topical.\n"
