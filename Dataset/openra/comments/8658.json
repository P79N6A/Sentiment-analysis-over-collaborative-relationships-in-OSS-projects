    "body": "Currently the `UpgradeManager`, when it notifies watchers of remaining upgrade time, also provides the total upgrade duration. This duration is simply taken to be the duration of the first upgrade that was granted. E.g. if for some reason the first EMP upgrade had a duration of 250 and a subsequent 300 ticks, the `UpgradeManager` would send a notification to the watcher that the progress is 300/250 (possibly causing bad stuff to happen). These kinds of situations are implicitly assumed to never happen by the existing code, and I'll go with the same assumption to keep this PR's size to a minimum.\n\nAlso, seeing how currently timed upgrades are either 0 or 1, notifications are sent only when upgrades are at the nonzero (1) level. The remaining time in the notifications represents how much longer the upgrade will be at the nonzero level. Again, to minimize the scope of this PR, I have chosen to do the analogous thing - only notify when at nonzero level and say how much time is left until back to zero level. The actual level info is not included in the notification.\n\nWRT the implementation, I wanted to keep LINQ out of `UpgradeManager.Tick()` so I've kept individual upgrades in `timedUpgrades`, but having each upgrade keep track of its granting sources.\n"
