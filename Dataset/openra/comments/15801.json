Select should by default only select the players actors, it would be weird and distracting to select all your allies' units when trying to command your forces ingame.  If the selection already contains other player's actors then those players should also be included in the expanded selection."

    "body": "@pchote It is based on current selection. If the selection includes actors from multiple owners and the current player is among them then only the player actors will be added to the selection. If the selection includes multiple allied units however, nothing will happen because the current code expects a single owner.\r\n\r\nThis feature is really only about allowing type selection by double clicking and hotkey for a single allied player. And selecting arbitrary allied actors is already possible with dragging (given the drag box doesn't include own units, which naturally have higher priority)."
