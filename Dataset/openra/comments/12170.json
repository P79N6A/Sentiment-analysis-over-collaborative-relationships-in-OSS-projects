    "body": "We actually used to do this, many years and mono versions ago.\n\nBack then mono's bundling tools didn't work properly on OSX, so I wrote an abomination that recursively copied and patched the libraries we needed to run OpenRA ([link for the curious](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/4c8575b1f53d5bff8b2e92e905dfe2f982f8c9f3/packaging/osx/package.sh)).\n\nWe threw that away at some point because 1) it was horrible, 2) it was hard to justify an OSX-specific packaging step when we were able to automate the rest of our packaging on a Linux box, and 3) it added ~15 MB to our installer download, which was a big deal back when the entire rest of the game was only 2MB and hosted off a single server with limited bandwidth.\n\nNone of these reasons are relevant now of course, but I haven't been in any rush to revisit those experiences :wink:\n\nWe eventually moved back to a native-code OSX launcher, which lives in its own repository: http://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRALauncherOSX.  In principle you just need to tweak the Makefile to link against and package a local mono framework.  Would you be interested in taking a shot at this?\n"

I've used a commandline tool called dylibbundler which would  copy all the linked dylibs from the executable to the app bundle, and sort through all the dll he*\\* re-linking everything together.  I'm sure a similar approach could be put in.  It's a little more cleaner, robust, and versatile then your script (Although that is some really nice scripting done there!).\n\nhttps://github.com/auriamg/macdylibbundler\n"

    "body": "The `libgdiplus.dylib` symlink is there to work around missing/incorrect paths defined in the mono standard library.  Life would be much simpler if that was the only dependency, but it isn't.\n\nmacdylibbundler appears to cover the native assembly rewriting (the `patch_mono` function in my old script), but we also need to change the references in the managed assembly metadata (the *.config files).\n\nMono's \"official\" procedure is to use their Xamarin.Mac framework, which then has a build task that compiles down to a .app bundle.  I haven't tested this, so it's not clear whether this uses a bundling tool that we could repurpose, or, more likely, AOT compiles everything down to native code (which we couldn't repurpose).\n\nResurrecting my old script is probably going to be the easiest option if we want to do this.\n"
