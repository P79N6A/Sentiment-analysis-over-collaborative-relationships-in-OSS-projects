    "body": "This bug exists also in the CNC Gold Mod - When you have say, 5 partially filled Silos, and sell one, you LOSE money instead of gain from the sale - what's in the silo is not redistributed.\r\n\r\nEG I have 5 silos 10% full. I sell one, so I should get 10% of resources put in other silos, and then like $120 from the sale of that silo, instead I lose 10% of my money total, netting a loss.\r\n\r\nI did some other testing. and I think this because whomever wrote the code to \"lose\" money when you sell full refineries, silos because there is no where for the money to go screwed up big time.\r\n\r\nYoutube Video here highlights this bug around this time:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/53ZydfqppVc?t=702 edited for time URL.\r\n"

    "body": "This is an issue still. I'll explain in more detail:\r\n\r\nIf you are trying to reproduce note this: only resources are affected, not cash(/starting money). What you see on the counter in top right is cash+resources. So get broke, harvest some and sell your ref. You will see.\r\n\r\nFor example if you have 2 ref each with 2000 capacity and 2000 resources harvested, if you then sell your ref, you will have 1220 (50% of 2000 + sell value) afterwards. which is bogus^^\r\n\r\nThis is totaly couter-intuitive as i would expect my people to take the spice stored in the ref and put it elsewhere, where it has some space. So to only loose money if my capacity is at MAX, not allways.\r\n\r\nSee this evidence:\r\n![ref_sell_anti-logic](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16046997/22300699/913f4f6e-e328-11e6-9d2d-e3b905a43db3.jpg)\r\n![ref_sell_anti-logic_ra](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16046997/22301065/e05bc1d0-e329-11e6-8b57-8154846b3356.jpg)\r\nImpact on real gameplay: selling your second ref in a buildorder like pp-rax-ref-ref looses you money instead of gain!\r\n"
