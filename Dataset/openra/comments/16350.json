    "body": "Classic pathfinding issue, usually related to units blocked by walls or by missing bridges (like in this game).\r\nThe first lag between 09:00 and 10:30 is caused by an artillery owned by I/O near the bottom bridge.\r\nAt the exact second (10:32) it stops trying to cross the bridge the lags ends.\r\nThe second lag between 12:00 and 13:00 is caused by the five rocket soldiers owned by Antonio Seruti and located 2-3 cells near the bottom bridge.\r\nAgain, at the exact second they stop trying to go to the island the lag ends.\r\nTo find which units causes the lag in a replay you can pause it, select a lot of units to see their targets and find the ones who can't reach it.\r\nWhen you experience a lag like this ingame, players can select their units and press S to ask them to stop their current action so nothing will try to cross a non-existent bridge.\r\nThere are related issues like https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/7694, https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/12435, https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/15083 and others."
