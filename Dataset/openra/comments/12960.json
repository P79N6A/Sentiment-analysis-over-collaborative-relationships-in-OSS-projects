    "body": "I see, it would probably be a good idea to change the yaml to this instead:\r\n\r\n`Weapon: UnitExplode`\r\n`EmptyWeapon: UnitExplode`\r\n\r\nThat way everybody will know the explosion strength is intentional and it will be consistent regardless whether the unit has attacked or not. I was 100% sure I had found a bug/oversight and at first I thought there was a bug with the trait itself as well since when I force-attacked my own guys into killing Grenadiers they would explode normally with UnitExplodeSmall. Took a while before I realized it was because they had not attacked and wasn't considered empty by the game.\r\n\r\nI think I won't be the last to think this is a bug unless the yaml is changed to make intentions super clear. Are we sure everybody still want them to use UnitExplode? After a quick look the only other thing in the game that seems to be using UnitExplode is \"^AmmoBox\" in default.yaml, crashing aircrafts and V2 Rocket.\r\n\r\nWait a minute, empty harvesters and empty minelayers also use UnitExplode. Do we want that? Meanwhile a fully loaded harvester get the OreExplosion which deals almost no damage.\r\n\r\nAlso, V2 Rocket uses V2Explode when loaded and UnitExplode when empty. That means when the V2 Rocket is empty the explosion AOE is 25% larger and does 11% more damage, surely something that doesn't make sense. Meanwhile the Artillery has explosions defined for both loaded (ArtilleryExplode) and unloaded (UnitExplodeSmall)."

So then the yaml should be:\r\n`Weapon: UnitExplodeSmall`\r\n`EmptyWeapon: UnitExplode`\r\nExactly like it is today, just more clear that it is intentional and not a bug. I could make a new commit with those changes. Maybe overlook the V2 Rocket/Harvester/Minelayer explosions as well?\r\n\r\nPersonally I'd rather have it the other way around and see if it really changes gameplay all that much in the next patch. That cat and mouse play that was talked about in #12728 gets mitigated by the 50% random chance that the death explosion even occurs in the first place, wouldn't it bring more strategic consistency if the explosions deals a reasonable amount of damage instead and has a 100% chance of occurring?\r\n\r\nThen if the unit turns out too weak or too strong you can just tweak the damage of the death explosion or the damage grenades have vs wood armor. As it is now it's a lottery because of the 50% explosion chance. It's much harder to balance stuff when random chance is involved."

    "body": "After actually testing and checking \"^Vehicle\" that V2 Rocket inherits from it has the Explodes trait with \"EmptyWeapon: UnitExplodeSmall\" defined after all. So an empty V2 Rocket does very little damage compared to a loaded V2 Rocket after all and both Artillery and V2 Rocket uses UnitExplodeSmall when destroyed while empty. But there doesn't seem to be a reason why Artillery is defining its EmptyWeapon explosion since it inherits from ^Tank, which inherits from ^Vehicle so it should already have UnitExplodeSmall as EmptyWeapon like all other vehicles.\r\n\r\nI noticed that I can't get the minelayer's empty explosion to trigger, seems like it is always considered loaded even when it has 0 mines? Could this be because it has no Armament trait? The unit does only define \"Weapon\" in their Explodes traits so the \"EmptyWeapon\" defined in ^Vehicle should be inherited.\r\n\r\nThe minor issue of a fully loaded Harvester dealing less damage (0) than an empty Harvester when exploding still remains."

    "body": "I don't mind testing with a smaller explosion.\r\n\r\nThe main reason to not change anything here is that grenadiers seem to be in a 'happy' place right now in terms of game balance. That said, they typically go unused outside of the early game. I don't know if changing explosions would encourage later use but that would probably be good for gameplay; I just don't see grens becoming overpowered if usable in the mid/late game.\r\n\r\nThe primary thing to look out for is the grenadier rush vs the pp/rax/ref/wf opener. It shouldn't be easy to hold off a  large rush with the above opener, but it shouldn't be impossible either. As long as changing the explosion size doesn't make grenadiers impossible to hold off I don't see a problem with it.\r\n\r\nOn a separate note, if grens end up with a smaller explosion I would like to see the explosion chance at 100% instead of the current 50%. The less RNG the better."

So then the yaml should be:\r\n`Weapon: UnitExplodeSmall`\r\n`EmptyWeapon: UnitExplode`\r\nExactly like it is today, just more clear that it is intentional and not a bug.\r\n\r\nCan you please do this?  We can then merge this PR and hopefully put this discussion and confusion finally to rest."
