    "body": "A note about world-unit ranges: `1c0` sometimes does _not_ match 1 cell in ts-terms (but sometimes, if there's an internal conversion from WDist to cells like for sight ranges, it does!).  In OpenRA `1c0` means the horizontal width, which is actually `sqrt(2) = 1.1414` of a TS cell.  This means that a TS six cell range actually needs to become `4c248` in OpenRA.  I expect this will affect weapon ranges.\n"
