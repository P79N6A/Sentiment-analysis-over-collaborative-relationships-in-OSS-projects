Please fetch and reset again.\n\nRegarding about clicking, and ignore given order, it doesn't really ignore orders. It's just that the default search area from a click is 12 tiles radius. That's quite big but I didn't change it. Could you please try again and see how it feels with 12 tiles radius? I could try to reduce that search radius if you say I should.\n"

    "body": "Wow that's really a comprehensive testing! Good job @MicroJOo.\n\nI'm aware of bots. It seems they have different logic on resource harvesting and will require further work, yet it would be cool if someone also interested in working with this teams up with me, as this is quite complex.\n\nMaybe I should start by refactoring the harvesters area of code like I did with pathfinder and Mobile.\n\nAbout lag spikes, I was certain they were going to happen when testing, don't ask me why. When deciding for the closest resource, the harvester has to analyze 24x24 cells aprox, which is quite big. Multiply that for as many harvesters there are and for each time I go for a resource, and you have a performance bottleneck indeed. I need to come up with an heuristic to take this kind of decisions faster.\n\nAbout those weird routes they took, I should see in live in which conditions, where you clicked, initial harvester position, linked refinery, etc. I should add some logging to the code to debug this in addition to some tests.\n"

Sometimes I may require a move without triggering resource finding.\n\nOther than that, my proposed behaviour checklist is the following:\n- When given a explicitly clicked target that contains a resource, collect that resource\n- This is a point of discussion: given a location that has no resource (and therefore we must run a search) should the harvester collect the closest resource to ITSELF that is inside his search radius, or collect the closest resource to THE CLICKED SEARCH POINT (and therefore it will collect resources in circles)? From a personal point of view, I prefer the harvester to collect resources in circles from the point where you clicked (I think this is the way games like Age of Empires work, once a specified resource is depleted they go for the closest one to the \"epicenter\" (the central point of a search).\n\nWhich leads to another discussion: Should the \"epicenter\" move depending on the latest harvested location? Right now it does.\n"

    "body": "> Sometimes I may require a move without triggering resource finding.\n\nHold alt to when clicking to force a move order instead of harvest.\n\nI agree with @MicroJOo and @UberWaffe that explicit orders _must_ be obeyed.  Another case where this is important is if a player wants to harvest a specific cell to clear enough space to place a structure.\n\n> Which leads to another discussion: Should the \"epicenter\" move depending on the latest harvested location? Right now it does.\n\nThis can lead to some strange harvesting patterns.  It would be better if it harvested around the target area until it runs out of resources.\n"

    "body": "I've changed the current harvesting pattern to go in circles from the last explicitly ordered position, and taking the closest node to the harvester between the center of the search and the closest node from the last harvested resource. To my taste it now presents a quite interesting behaviour, while \"obeying\" to collect the explictly selected tile as it's been requested.\n\nI would wish to know if you like it better the way it is right now (except for that center search area detail).\n"
