This isn't a really good thing by itself.\nAlso there is a ton of stuff that can go wrong with the installation - the user might not have permissions, the installation process can fail due to whatever reason, the script can throw when trying to delete the file that you just started...\n\n:-1: for automatic installation (of anything)\n"
