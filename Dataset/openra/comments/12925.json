    "body": "I think this is technically interesting, but i'm not sold on it as a feature.\r\n\r\nRight now our explicit condition granting makes it easy for modders (who may not be programmers and very likely don't know the specific details of OpenRA's internals) to understand what is going on, and it also makes it very easy to statically lint condition usage.\r\n\r\nAdding an extra layer on top to implicitly construct granted condition types feels like a step backwards: it adds cognitive and code overhead, but doesn't seem to enable any new capabilities (except for removing boilerplate, but as above I consider the current level of boilerplate to be a feature).\r\n\r\nCan you please convince me otherwise?"

    "body": "I'm a bit conflicted, because while I agree with @pchote on all the points,  if multiple Health traits would ever happen (and such were among the long-term developer wishlist, according to the discussion back at my damagetypes-without-warheads PR), then I guess that would justify the health setups (although probably by then we will have a method to differ between the multiple Health traits for selfhealing and etc as well which GrantConditionOnDamageState could use as well).\r\n\r\nGrantConditionWithSound isn't using explicit interfaces either which is a problem in design terms and a prime example why I never and still doesn't favor the reasons behind explicit interfaces here either."
