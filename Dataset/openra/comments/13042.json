So this means the Commando can shoot up to a range of 8 but needs to scout the enemy unit to shoot at a range of 8. (This was done to buff Commandos but still need a scouting eye to his this range.)\r\n\r\nBut with its scan radius at 6 it will auto target at a range of 6 despite its weapon range being 8. In this regard is best to have a scan radius or to remove it completely and just have the autotarget trait?"
