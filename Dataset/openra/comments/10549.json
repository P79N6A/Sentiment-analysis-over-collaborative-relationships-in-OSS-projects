    "body": "This is suspiciously tied to the recent changes from #10521.\nThe error in the stack trace (after reading up on some MSDN and StackOverflow) turns out to be that `Math.Abs()` recieved `int.MinValue`, which it is [designed to throw that specific exception](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dk4666yx%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) on.\n\n_Some educated and partially-supported-by-facts guesses coming up:_\nThis happened because (from what I hear) the Forgotten Commando has a range of 12 cells. That lead to [this here `WVec`](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/OpenRA.Mods.Common/Traits/Attack/AttackGarrisoned.cs#L142) being `(12c0, 0)` or close to that. Which (fast forward a bit), led to a `Math.Abs(int.MinValue)` [here](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/OpenRA.Game/WAngle.cs#L83), supposedly when `i == 255`.\n"
