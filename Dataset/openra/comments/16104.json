I have installed newest version of Catalyst Control Center driver for ATI Radeon X300/X550/X1050 Series graphics card.\r\nI'll try to redownload and reinstall, so I could report if it had any effects.\r\n-Edit:\r\nI've downloaded fresh installation of OpenRA and updated driver to latest version available, still logs before and after are identical."
