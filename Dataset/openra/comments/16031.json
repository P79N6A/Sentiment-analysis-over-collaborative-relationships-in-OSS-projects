    "body": "I've had exactly the same experience, and looking at the Lua code (not my strongest language and I'm a beginner with the Lua API, so be gentle) it seems there is a recursive call at the end of the [TargetAndAttack function](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/b1e87e4f60175cf753697d890c0a299c202e65cf/mods/ra/maps/allies-08a/allies08a-AI.lua#L148), no matter what happens in the function. \r\n\r\nTarget selection in mission 7 is only slightly different from mission 8, but when the plane is selects a target (randomly from every enemy in the map) to attack in 7 it is visible, so the plane does an Attack successfully. (Which I guess means it will take a while to return?) In mission 8 I think it selects an enemy it can't see (many more targets in the big base than in the players force), so Attack returns at once and TargetAndAttack gets called again, etc. All starting at 34 seconds (on easy) because that is when the first mig is ready. \r\n\r\nTo check out my theory I changed `mig.Attack(target)` to `mig.Move(target.Location)` and the game didn't hang, with a mig dutifully flying in to the base and getting shot down.\r\n\r\nI imagine the recursive call is there to make sure migs continually look for targets, and it will work fine when the mapwide random targeting selects a visible enemy. I can't find anything in the Lua API that will tell you if an actor is visible to a player or to only select visible units, so I'm not sure how best to fix it."
