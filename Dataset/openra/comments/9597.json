    "body": "We originally wrote the zoom code with support for non-integer zooms (which is why you were able to enable this so easily), but we then had to disable it because this approach introduces unacceptable tradeoffs.  We have enabled the half-zoom to the editor (using our standard `.` zoom hotkey) because that is more of a dev tool, and the benefit of seeing the extra map outweighs the glitches.\n\nLike @x-a-n-a-x pointed out above there can be serious graphical glitches (such as 1 pixel wide holes in the map) on certain GPUs based on the way that they round the fractional numbers.  We are going to fix that by changing the way that we render (first into a 1:1 buffer, and then scaling that single image based on the requested zoom), but this just haven't happened yet.\n\nThanks for the contribution! but unfortunately we won't be able to take this :cry:  Sorry.\n"
