(using Tanya’s C4 cursor)\r\n- Wire Cutters: Engineers can instantly remove one cell of adjacent wire fencing. (Play fence being run over sound)\r\n- Salvager: Engineers can salvage husks for 40% (spitballing) of the destroyed vehicle’s value. This uses the dollar-sign sell cursor when placed over a husk while an engineer is selected. The husk disappears after it is salvaged and the player is rewarded the credits. (Perhaps go with a quick capture bar instead of making salvage instant)\r\n- Engineers can detect (3 cells) and disarm landmines from an adjacent cell.\r\n"
