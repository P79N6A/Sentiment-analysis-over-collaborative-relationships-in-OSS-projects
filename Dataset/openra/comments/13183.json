    "body": "The lockstep networking model is used by pretty much every RTS game ever built, it is absolutely standard because it is the only reasonable technical approach that these kind of games can use.\r\n\r\nAccording to somebody claiming to be a former EA developer who worked on the 2013 C&C reboot, using a FPS-style server-client networking model was [one of the big failings that contributed to the bad gameplay that lead to its cancellation](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/65pd76/if_you_could_bring_back_any_game_from_your/dgd3o7j/):\r\n> Speaking of engineering. God damn. The game was an authoritative client-server model, where the server would model the game, and broadcast game state to the clients, which merely rendered it. Great for stopping cheating, but due to performance issues, the game's logical frame rate was 4FPS (literally 250ms per tick). And that didn't really account for latency. So you'd order a unit to go in one direction, and then very noticeably later, it would finally obey that order. This slow gameplay frame rate also made things like accurate crushing, and other effects (like high rate-of-fire weapons like gatts and quads) almost impossible.\r\n\r\nThis ticket is going in at least two different directions, so I'm going to close it now.\r\nIf anybody has specific information about performance problems then please create a new ticket, one per problem."

    "body": "It seems like a mistake to close this issue outright, at least without a definitive answer as to why it's `wontfix` or `invalid`. I may be mistaken in my interpretation of your response, but either it's a known bug, and it's not fixable. Or it's not really a bug at all, and the lag in multiplayer in intentional. Because I agree the latter is hyperbolic, the former must be the reason.\r\n\r\nThat's a very interesting quote, and more than enough reason to abandon my original suggestion, IMO it's not enough to close this issue yet. \r\n\r\nI'd like to work through this issue a bit more, is there any other issues, or pages, or lines of code that would give me a better understanding of how and why the game would go out of sync? I'd like too look into it and offer some real suggestions to reduce or minimize the apparent lag for players who's system and network is capable of handling multiplayer."
