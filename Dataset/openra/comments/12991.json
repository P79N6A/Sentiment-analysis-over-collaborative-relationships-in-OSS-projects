    "body": "PR #13081\r\n\r\nThis is complicated/hacky currently. Some buildings can repair, some rearm, some both. There is only 1 order now \"Enter\" and Heli/Plane AirCraft behaves differently.\r\n\r\nHeli, when target is reserved, looks always for next free HeliBase, which does not repair. Should heli go to next base or service pad or? Did you want to rearm or repair?\r\n\r\nI did one minimal change/fix - If target is reserved Repair building, do nothing instead of searching for next HeliBase. So it doesn't fly away and you can send it again to repair. \r\nNot changed - if target is reserved Rearm building (HeliBase), go to next free HeliBase like so far."
