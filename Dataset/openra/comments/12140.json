This change just clogs up rearming.\n\nA more understandable method could be to have an interface which can trigger the heli to land at specific actions (think Generals helicopters landing when a passenger wants to enter) and mechanic triggering this interface or giving helicopters a deploy command which lets them land and fly.\n\nAlso, since the mechanic already uses a nonmelee repair weapon, allowing this weapon to repair aircraft would already solve the problem in a more elegant way.\n"
