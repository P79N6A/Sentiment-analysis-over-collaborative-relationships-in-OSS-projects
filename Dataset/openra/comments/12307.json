I think this is a good idea but I do have a few questions:\n\nDoes this also affect aircraft? If so how would AA guns work with them near Gaps? Would defense structures become stronger or should another unit be able to extend range for situations as this? (IE: Frances mobile gap generator ignoring gap shroud affects. Radar unit ignore gap shroud affects while also useful of its redirective missile mechanic.)\n"

    "body": "Great work! It's very exciting to have a functional tweak for the redundant gap generator which at the same time pays homage to the original game. \n\nBalance wise I think it will take quite some time to figure this one out. Vision range is the most important property for engaging battle and for making quick decisions and we've seen the effect of even small vision range nerfs or buffs of various units with previous balance changes. As it stands above my best guess is it would likely break the game in a lot of situations given that target firing and planned approach would more or less go out the window with the gap generator. Customizing unit specific effects seems like an absolute must. In this regard I think it's worth posting this topic on the forum and have a proper brainstorming on it. There's just so many factors involved.\n"

France's Mobile Gap Generator also comes to mind. \n\nA few cells reduction of vision range for defensive structures would make base pushes harder to pull off. \n\nAs for aircraft, cutting the vision range in half would probably be brutal, giving the opponent 0 chances to identify targets withing the sphere of the Gap Generator. 2 cells vision range reduction (10, down from 12) enables MiGs/Longbows to barely get a glimpse of an AA Gun placed within it. Yak/Hinds still stand no chance with the reduction (8, down form 10) but ought to have some way of peeking into the gap shroud. These last points hinges somewhat on #12330 \n"
