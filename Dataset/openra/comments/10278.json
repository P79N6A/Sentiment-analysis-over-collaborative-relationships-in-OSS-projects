    "body": "This might be due to the improved missile 'shouldExplode' check.\n\nThe `Missile.CloseEnough` default (298) is larger than the `ChangeOwner` warhead's range, so I suspect that the missile nearly always explodes more than 256 WDist away from target.\n\nIn addition, the warhead's Range ignores `HitShapes` and measures distance to target center, so it almost never explodes close enough.\n\nReducing Inaccuracy to 384 and increasing COWH Range from 256 to 512 fixed it for me.\n"
