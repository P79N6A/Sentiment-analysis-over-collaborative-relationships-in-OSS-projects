The `GrantConditionAfterDelay` trait is mostly redundant vs `GrantTimedCondition` so I would rather not merge both of them, except for making the status bar work correctly in this charge/discharge scenario.\r\n\r\nThe \"unit has an ability that you can activate by deploying after a chargeup period, then lasts for a limited time before deactivating and recharging\" usecase is common enough to justify its own `GrantChargeDischargeCondition` trait that does everything.  This has the additional benefit of being able to extend it with support for cancelling the condition part way through and reactivating or reducing the recharge time, which couldn't be done by assembling lower level traits."
