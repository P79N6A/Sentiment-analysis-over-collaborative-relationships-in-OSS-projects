    "body": "A 3d tiled map sounds like a bit too much. Multiple layers are a good idea though. For the map format, we could simply add a new section to the `map.yaml`.\r\n```\r\nLayers:\r\n    Layer@hill:\r\n        Offset: 10\r\n    Layer@clouds:\r\n        Offset: 236\r\n```\r\nThe main layer has to be completely filled, always has the offset 0 and is saved in the file `map.bin`. The first additional layer is drawn 10 units above the ground layer and saved in the file `map_hill.bin` while the second one is drawn 236 units above the main layer and saved in the file `map_clouds.bin`. The information for the vertical collision should in the tileset like we currently do it for the horizontal \"collision\" information.\r\n\r\nThis would allow multiple layers without breaking the compatibility with older maps."

    "body": "What about this idea:\r\nMap format currently has its specific order:\r\n- TilesOffset\r\n- HeightsOffset\r\n- ResourcesOffset\r\n\r\ninstead of that, a type-byte could be used prepended with another byte\r\n\r\n```\r\nbyte numChunks;\r\n{\r\n  byte type; // 0x00 = TilesOffset, 0x01 = HeightsOffset, 0x02 = ResourcesOffset\r\n  int offset;\r\n} * numChunks;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt first does this allow maps to become smaller if a given layer is not used int this map. Flat maps (all on height 0) do not need the HeightsOffset, and maps without any resources at all, do not need that type too. In worst case this makes the existing maps exactly 4 bytes larger.\r\n\r\nHowever if the Map class allows you to add different MapLayerReader objects (assigned via mod.yaml), you could extend the map on mod-side with 0x03 = TopLayer, 0x04 = UndergroundLayer, ... whatever your mod actualy needs.\r\n\r\nNot focusing the further implementation now, because in my eyes the basic change in format would be step 1, followed by modularization of the map / layer reading logic.\r\n\r\n~~To be more fail-proof and to avoid multiple mods reserving the same type byte value, they might be replaced by a 0 terminated string containing the actual class to read this layer.~~ After thinking about that i do not like that idea that much anymore, but it might be worth to note here.\r\n"
