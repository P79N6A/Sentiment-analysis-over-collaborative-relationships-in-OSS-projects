If GitHub contributors are inequipped to take on community input properly we may relatively soon end up with a dedicated RA blance team (as recently touch upon by the developers) in order to circumvent blocks on moving the RA gameplay forward. \n\nIf we want to keep the dynamic open between the casual/competetive player and the active GitHub contributors then I believe that this balance PR is a step forward in the right direction and will further encourage the larger community to get involved in discussions, experimenting and playtesting. As I see it there is are **tons** of potential for making the RA mod's casual and competetive gameplay richer and with the limited playerbase we have today, so much to gain by moving the balancing forward.\n"
