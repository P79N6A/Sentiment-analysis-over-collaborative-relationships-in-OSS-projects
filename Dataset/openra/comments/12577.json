    "body": "Some of the issues that i've made note of:\r\n\r\nJumpjets:\r\n* The jet animation stops when the actor is stopped mid-air.\r\n* FallsToEarth can't trigger WithDeathAnimation, so corpses disappear once they hit the ground.\r\n* Flying infantry don't have shadows because WithShadow doesn't work properly with upgrades.\r\n\r\nSubterranean units:\r\n* Cargo needs a condition to disable loading/unloading while underground.\r\n\r\nTunnels:\r\n* The \"enter\" cursor on tunnel entrances to move to the other side isn't implemented.\r\n* Units can hide inside tunnels where they become invulnerable.  Once the tunnel entrance code works idle units need to be able to automatically pick an entrance and leave.\r\n* Cargo and other traits need condition support to disable them while inside tunnels.\r\n\r\nBridges:\r\n* The whole implementation is a static placeholder similar to #11441, and needs to be rewritten after Mobile/DomainIndex have been refactored and we can support damage and repair.\r\n* The input code needs to be able to distinguish between different movement layers to allow move orders onto elevated bridges.\r\n\r\nI'll update this list with additional issues found during testing so that we can file tickets once this is merged."
