    "body": "> No one will probably ever change from the default PNG format\n\nThat is the core of my argument.  Adding support for bmp, tiff, and even jpg (although one could reasonably argue to keep that) introduces extra code and API surface area (we now depend implicitly on libtiff etc) for no real benefit.  You know as well as, and probably better than, anyone that libgdiplus is fragile and causes problems for packagers.\n\nWe should not be introducing new hidden settings for features that maybe 2 people in our entire player base might use but which nobody will need. If somebody has a use case that isn't covered by png then they can convert the lossless png to whatever format they want.\n\nPlease give me a usecase where somebody would want a bmp or tiff screenshot, and explain why those cases are important enough for us to support natively, while ignoring people who want PCX or WebP format screenshots.\n"
