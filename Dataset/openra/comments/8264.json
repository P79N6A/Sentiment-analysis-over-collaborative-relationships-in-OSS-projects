Once you are done, we may want to advertise your repositories at https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAWeb.\n\nYou will run into compilation errors from time to time as we don't test our builds against Mono 2.10 anymore and got a WONTFIX from @Xamarin on https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=30256 However the patches are usually simple and we will try to fix those compilation errors due to oversights in our code ASAP and can help you there.\n\nI was told that Mono 4 is work in progress and @tpokorra is currently updating everything at https://github.com/tpokorra/lbs-mono-fedora It was even noteworthy https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Mono-4-Fedora-23\n"

    "body": "I'm rather angry to see @rapgro drop this with such predjudice after the work we have put in over the years to try and support Fedora.  We wasted a lot of time rewriting our dependency fetching and compilation setup (more than once) for the sake of their arbitrary bundling rules, and we took the flak for dropping Windows XP support largely because we wanted to replace Mono.NAT with Open.NAT and unblock the Fedora packaging again.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the final straw was that I was \"unwilling to accept proposed solutions\" by questioning the latest demand to replace one of our long-stable dependencies with an untested and unmaintained replacement.\r\n\r\nThe discussion in the redhat bug then doesn't even have the respect of justifying the choice, instead just saying \"I don't want to invest my costly time to explain the same things again\".  Well thanks, you've wasted a lot more of our time than we have yours."

Please don't expect any further comment from my side on this issue, my free time is too costly. Anyone else interested, feel free to continue my started work."
