    "body": ">Shps and Westwood PALs are a PITA to work with, the tools are limited, broken and not intuitive.\r\n\r\nNonsense. Complete nonsense. If you want to work with PITA formats, look at what Heroes 2/3 or (Open)TTD use and then add remap on top of that (Okay, TTD has something akin to remap, asin switching a part of the palette to another part). FLICster of Civ3 is also weird with basically being an importer/exporter with even the alpha/remap masks being convoluted. Yes, Civ3 uses masks with an 8 bit image format.\r\n\r\nOpenRA.Utility is indeed unintuitive for SHP creation, but SHP Builder and XCC Mixer are far from unintuitive, especially if one looks around what other formats are in use.\r\n\r\n32 bit image formats would be okay only with remap masks, but that involves color bleeding at the edges (considering the feedback of display scaling, that would probably end up with inferior results even). Although I guess we can learn how to do that fine from the OpenTTD modding scene.\r\n\r\nBesides, considering 32 bit image formats is fuel to the fire of that texture bloating issue which results with the random-black-terrain issue on RA2 and already prevents terrain sizes like YR Terrain Expansion's NewUrban or Snow terrain being used in an OpenRA mod."
