    "body": "If this isn't just a trivial yaml change then IMO we should defer this to Next + 1.  The new bot plumbing enables a whole range of AI improvements, but that plumbing itself is the main thing currently delaying us. We've already scope creeped past our original goals for a christmas playtest, and then a new years playtest.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer it if we could limit the current cycle to getting the plumbing finished and debugged, and then focus on improving the gameplay behaviour for the next cycle.  Even with nothing else, the AI improvements would justify a new release."
