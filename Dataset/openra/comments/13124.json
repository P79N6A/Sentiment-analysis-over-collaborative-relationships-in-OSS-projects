    "body": "I consider this to be a bad idea.  If the \"return to base\" feature is not fit for purpose, then that should be changed.  Adding an entirely new hotkey that works *almost* the same adds UI complexity that runs against the goal of having a streamlined control scheme.\r\n\r\nThis also ties in to the long running argument about having the game play itself vs providing a skill ramp by requiring players to manage their own units."

    "body": "@rob-v I would appreciate it if you could restart discussion on tickets before starting work on them.\r\n\r\nAnybody can file issues, and many tickets are based on opinion or frustration rather than planned game design.  It is stressful as a reviewer to have to fundamentally rewrite or reject a PR after the work has already been done – especially right now, with our constrained review bandwidth – so it would make life a lot easier if these tickets could be evaluated and a plan of attack determined (which may be closing the ticket) before the PR stage."
