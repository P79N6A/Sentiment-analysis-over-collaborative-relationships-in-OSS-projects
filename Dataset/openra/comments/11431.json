I left it in to give French players more options if your opponent doesn't know you are playing France. A live decoy as it were.\n\nI don't think this is valid, if someone wants to see the country they can look at the tooltip flag. Should just remove it from France since the camo pbox is a direct upgrade.\n"

A $400 pillbox counters all early game threats just as well as a $600 camo pillbox except for blobs. If you invest in fakes to counter early scouting thats less money for defense in general.\n\nPersonally I find them more useful late game to lure tanya and paradrops but a visible pillbox is just as good as a deterrent. By mid and late game you have to deal with armor so I feel their usefulness becomes reduced at that point. The meta is also slowly shifting to mobile armies on wider open maps which further reduces the effectiveness of static deferences. I thought a reduction in price might see them scattered about bases and expansions more which would help slow pushes against someone playing France.\n\nA different change I toyed with which seemed ok was buffing the garrisoned RS RoF from 50 -> 40. That gives you an option to use camo pillboxes for effective anti armour as well. It would buff pillboxes too but their lower HP doesn't begin to rival a turret.\n"

    "body": "I hate to say this after all the above discussions but I've had second thoughts on the France exclusive c.pillbox for some time now. It doesn't feel right to alter the options for all Allies simply in order to help France diversify. There was a big surge of enthusiasm on the idea in midst of misc. playtesting that went all over the place (not to say it was bad). I understand how the c.pillbox ties into France as a deception faction but I think the overall gameplay would benefit more from giving the Allies' factions a real option between the two pillboxes instead.The c.pillbox is crucial for Allies on defending its' tech and supports creative tactics that fit's moments during gameplay, _not_ as an overall pre-game strategy.\n\nWhen we tested out the exclusive French camo pillbox the price was reduced to $500 and HP down to 450 so that France wouldn't be stuck with the $600 price tag and to adress the alledgedly OP 600 HP. In the scenario where you have both options, I think $600 for 450HP could be enough to have players decide between the camo. and the regular throughout a game.\n"

    "body": "It would seem there is no agreement on how to balance this properly for both multiplayer and singleplayer then?\n\n@SoScared I have to completely disagree. I don't think a camo pillbox is crucial for defending late game tech any more than properly used normal pillboxes. I will however concede the point I made about focusing on early game. As @cjshmyr hinted at, a cheap camo pb would probably be a little OP. This is why the current state of the pull request is simply keeping the camo pillbox unchanged, apart from it being Faction specific.\n\nCurrently choosing a faction as Allied is gimmicky compared to the Soviets. Anti infantry for Ukraine is completely different to the shock balls of Russia. The Soviet factions are suited to players with slightly different playstyles in the same way as the Allied and Soviet sides are suited for players with very different playstyles.\n\nAllies have so many underused and overlapping units that I never feel that any one Allied faction actually lends itself to **any** particular playstyle. I think it would be good to try and actively encourage that like has been done with the Soviet factions.\n\nIf players prefer to aggressively expand and use defenses for expansions then France _should_ be a good choice. If players prefer more microing and harassment then England _should_ be a good choice. If players like aggressively attacking then Germany _should_ be a good choice. \n"

On top of that the c.pillbox is cloaked. This is the main reason the regular pillbox is getting phased out. Even when players are broke they favor the c.pillbox.\n\nWith a 450HP c.pillbox the choice would no longer be obvious. You'd be deciding between cloak or durability for your buck.\n"
