    "body": "#12818 didn't take those away, they were already missing ;)\r\n\r\nThe real underlying problem is that disabling all actors that shouldn't be available for each mission individually is basically just a giant yaml hack around the fact that we don't have any real mission `TechLevel` system. Short-term, fixing the missions individually might be easier, but mid-to-long-term I think we should replace our error-prone current approach with a real singleplayer `TechLevel` system."
