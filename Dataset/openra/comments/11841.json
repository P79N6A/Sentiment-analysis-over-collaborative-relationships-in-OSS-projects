If you order your soldier to move, he will start to struggle.\n\nNo reason to get sarcastic when it's your fault.\nI said With**Sprite**Body for a reason, not by mistake.\n\nAlso, you need to set\n\n``` yaml\nWithInfantryBody:\n    UpgradeTypes: WebDisable\n    UpgradeMaxEnabledLevel: 0\n```\n\non `^Infantry`, not `^Soldier`, civilians and cyborgs were web-able as well in the original.\n\nBut more importantly:\nThe Cyborg Reaper was a _unit_ in Firestorm, not an infantry, which makes sense since it's more mechanical than biological, and we should keep it that way.\nThat would also save you the hassle of disabling all kinds of inherited traits. Set it up the same way like the Wolverine/SMECH (except that you need to add the `WithDeathAnimation`).\n\nAnother thing: You need to add the `webguy` sequence to more than just the `^BasicInfantry`, unfortunately there were too many deviations for some of the special infantry, so medic, both cyborgs, jumpjet, and weedguy don't inherit it.\n"
