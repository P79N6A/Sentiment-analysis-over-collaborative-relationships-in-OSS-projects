    "body": "> This is stupid.\n\nNo, this is changing a dice-roll-generated default value to a sensible one. It's not disabling `Acceleration`, it's setting a proper default to avoid side-effects like those that caused the issue to be opened in the first place. From there any weapon can set its own acceleration if it needs it.\n\nBut you are right, there are a lot more apparently random generated default values in that class. In any case, this is probably good enough to fix the issue for the release. We can do more fine tuning (and hopefully fixing those ridiculous defaults) and reintroducing acceleration to RA missiles, because it looks pretty good, for the next release.\n\nP.S.: We should make sure this doesn't regress anything in the 3 shipped mods before we merge it!\n"

Most missiles does not override the LaunchSpeeds so they will stay varied, which means missiles might end up being launched with a low speed without catching up to their old speed.\n\nJust the TS/RA2/heightmap mods would have an issue with perma-slow missiles due to no acceleration. The minimum speed is only ever used with regards to heightmaps.\n\nPersonally I would want all the defaults to be for an accelerated missile, we'd need less duplication in yaml, and that's I think the end goal. Point of this patch was just to be a band-aid for prep (TS is not shipped there), so I'll need to retarget the merge branch with a new PR. We'd be following up on bleed with a more proper fix in the future.\n\n> Set the MaximumSpeed default to MaximumLaunchSpeed instead of disabling Acceleration for the effect.\n\nIf we go this route we'd make yaml additions instead of changing the info class default. I'm more in favor of this but opting for least effort if we can.\n"
