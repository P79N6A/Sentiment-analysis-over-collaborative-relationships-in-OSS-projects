    "body": "This PR currently works by defaulting the chat nickname to the player name if (and only if) the chat nickname is not set.  This works up until the first time that you connect to the global chat, at which point `Game.Settings.Chat.Nickname` is set and that nick will be used as the default for all future sessions.\r\n\r\nThis then doesn't solve #9728, in particular:\r\n> the player name setting should be favored over the \"last used nickname\"\r\n\r\nI don't think that the additional complexity is worthwhile for a feature that stops working as soon as somebody uses the chat.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in IRC, the way I see this approach being useful would be to remove `Game.Settings.Chat.Nickname` completely, and then always default the name textbox with the current player name."
