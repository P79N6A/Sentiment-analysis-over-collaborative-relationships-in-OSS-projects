    "body": "OpenRA has native HiDPI capabilities (pixel multiplies all sprite based art, draws higher resolution versions of vector art), but they are disabled by default on Windows and Linux because of poor OS support.\r\n\r\nIf you're on Windows and *only* if you use an integer display scaling factor (2 or 3, but not e.g. 1.75) then you can add `DisableWindowsDPIScaling: False` under the `Graphics` section in your settings.yaml.\r\n\r\nIf you're on Linux you can define an environment variable `OPENRA_DISPLAY_SCALE=2`(or 3 or whatever - again this needs to be an integer) before launching the game.\r\n\r\nPixel doubling is intended as a quick toggle for when you need finer unit control. Introducing additional options in a cycle would hurt this main usecase."
