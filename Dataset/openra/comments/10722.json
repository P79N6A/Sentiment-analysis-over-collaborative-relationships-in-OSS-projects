The decision needs to be made here.\n\nThe general consensus on IRC (from at least myself, @penev92, and @Phrohdoh) was that downloading the asset files to travis was a horrible idea, but that the benefits outweighed the horribleness.  We later discovered additional drawbacks to (2) that changed that original evaluation (requiring all servers to have a copy of the assets), and so the balance shifts to (1) and the need for the assets on travis goes away.\n\nI would be okay with keeping the assets on travis if the sequence checks alone provided enough benefit to justify it.  I can't think of any bugs/regressions in the last couple of years where they would have helped (but correct me if you know of any), so this ends up back at the age old \"\"because we can\" isn't sufficient\" argument.\n"
