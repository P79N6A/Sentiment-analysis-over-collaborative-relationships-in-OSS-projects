Weak vs Infantry\n\nalso:\n- Strong vs Buildings, slow-moving targets\n\nwhy \"Buildings\" but not \"Targets\" ?\n\n> No . after Unarmed, please.\n\nThis would create a case where most lines end in \".\" and only \"Unarmed\" does not - according to http://www.edufind.com/english-grammar/period-full-stop-or-point/ it is ok to put \".\" after a single word.\n\n> Shouldn't the second tab be named as Support? Or do I remember wrong that it was treated as such...\n\nThat's a good point - the Tiberium silo is not a defense structure\n"
