    "body": "Note that issues opened in this repository involve the development of upstream OpenRA but usually not development of mods downstream. Unless the subject of your issue is a limitation, feature request or bug of the engine, it is probably a better idea to ask in the modding section of the forum or in the modding channel of the discord servet.  Links to both places can be found on openra.net. It is a good idea to ask in those places at first when experiencing issues while modding to make sure the issue has to be fixed upstream (then please report!) and not in your own code. I can't say what's the case here so take it as a general advice :)"
