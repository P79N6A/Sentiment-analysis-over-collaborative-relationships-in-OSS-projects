    "body": "An option worthy to think about could be that instead of segmenting the map as the coarse step, the AI could assemble a list of targetable actors through a `ValidTargets/InvalidTargets/ValidStances` filter and calculate fine targeting values based on their surroundings.\r\n\r\nThis would also give the benefit of fixing isometric targeting along.\r\n\r\nThere is a module in AS already working like this."
