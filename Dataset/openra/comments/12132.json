I have been asked by players to remove this (along with the IP) for registered players as part of #2265.\n\nSo, looking forward, I do not think that having a country lookup for unregistered players in the lobby by itself justifies the amount of trouble that is required to maintain the feature and the file size bloat.\n"

Looking at your code, you only appear to use the country name. Something like this should work (untested):\n\n``` csharp\npublic class GeoIP2Record\n{\n    [MaxMind.Db.Constructor]\n    public GeoIP2Record(\n        GeoIP2Country country\n     )\n    {\n        GeoIP2Country = country;\n    }\n\n    public GeoIP2Country Country { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class GeoIP2Country\n{\n    [MaxMind.Db.Constructor]\n    public GeoIP2Country(\n        GeoIP2CountryNames names\n     )\n    {\n        Names = names;\n    }\n\n    public GeoIP2CountryNames Names { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class GeoIP2CountryNames\n{\n    [MaxMind.Db.Constructor]\n    public GeoIP2Country(\n        string en\n     )\n    {\n        English = en;\n    }\n\n    public string English { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\nand then in your existing code:\n\n``` csharp\nvar record = reader.Find<GeoIP2Record>(IPAddress.Parse(ip))\n```\n\nThis also has the advantage of being much, much faster as it will only decode the above data from the database rather than all of the data for the IP address.\n\nAlso, `MaxMind.Db` [now includes](https://github.com/maxmind/MaxMind-DB-Reader-dotnet/tree/master/mono) `csproj` build files for Mono, which should help out with the Fedora packaging issue. I suspect we will also add similar files for `MaxMind.GeoIP2` in the next release, if you continue to use that.\n"
