    "body": "@pchote you are right, this will have some serious implications on the AI that needs to be fixed. For the player behaviour, idle actors should attack enemy targets when their not in defense mode, so a circling plane would re-attack the target as soon as it is visible again. This is currently not the case for planes (and helicopters?) but it is for land-units. So that would need to be implemented too.\n\nI can make some time to investigate this and add this to the PR. It is a lot of work but I think it is better than units that won't lose their targets.\n\n@Phrohdoh will do.\n"

I have modified the ProtectionStates state in such a way that if the AI gets attacked, they will form a squad and try to counter the attack (original behaviour). But instead of following the player all around the map, the AI will only chase them as long as they are visible and on losing the target, the AI will stop the chase after a short period of time and returns to base.\n\nBefore this PR, the bot would chase the player all around the map until the target was destroyed, even if the bot was actually 'defending' the base. \n\nI have not yet modified the attack states because it didn't really affect the changes I made. I have tested this by playing a couple of games against bots, hopefully you guys can help me out in a playtest or something to firmly test this.\n"

    "body": "I did notice one regression after all, in the mission Intervention: the planes flying air strikes against your base and the village don't attack anymore but just circle over the target. The reason is that the mission script tells the aircraft to attack a specific actor while they are still way out of range, so they can't see the target yet and lose it immediately.\n\nAircraft are the only actors that have a real \"attack this actor\" type of function in the Lua API. I see two solutions:\n1. Changing the Lua script to only issue the attack order when the aircraft has already revealed the target.\n2. Adding a flag to the `FlyAttack` (and probably `HeliAttack`) activity which controls whether visibility should be taken into account, with a default value of `true`.\n"
