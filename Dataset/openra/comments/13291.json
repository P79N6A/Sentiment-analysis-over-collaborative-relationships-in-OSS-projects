I mean, the AI doesn't spawn mine layers anyway so there isn't really anyone benefiting from this \"balance\". I never use minelayers because I know I'll spend half the match babysitting my own units. Its bad enough knowing they can't even seek out units shooting them a tile outside of their range. Having to eye them down every time they get near a mine just adds to the un-fun part of micromanaging bases and units. \r\n\r\nIt's like having a gun in a household with children and choosing not to take safety precautions (like locking it in a safe or teaching them gun safety) when you know for a fact the brats will try to play with it and point it at each other.\r\n\r\nExcept in this case, they can actually prevent an incident from happening but, opted not to because it _wouldn't be fair that they didn't get to learn from the mishap_  (even if it kills them before they could apply the experience elsewhere). \r\n\r\nI'm sorry but, if someone has enough time to make a game of lemmings out of blocking paths with mines, there's just something wrong with that individual (considering the deploy key doesn't work so you'd have to manually click the minelayer every...single...time)."

Mostly because I wanted more Tiberium or Red Alert story; not a third story that had nothing to do with either universes. Also, my computer (at the time) wasn't strong enough (Gateway Windows 98) lol\r\n\r\nBeing able to press ctrl to place lines of mines is news to me though.
