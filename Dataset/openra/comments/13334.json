The following units were jumpjets and thereby had hover-on the spot behaviour: Nighthawk, Rocketeer, Kirov (along with YR's Siege Chopper, Floating Disk and Cosmonaut). Note that the Harrier or the Black Eagle ain't among them.\r\n\r\nIf the bleed VTOL flag would work properly (apparently not), then we would already be able to replicate TS/RA2 aircraft behaviour with CanHover: no and VTOL: yes but apparently such a setup doesn't take off vertically when built.
