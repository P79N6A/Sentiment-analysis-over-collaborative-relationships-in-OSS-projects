    "body": "This is an awkward PR to review because it focuses on an end goal that is not a priority for our main mods, while leaving the prerequisites (which *are* priorities for us) underdeveloped.\r\n\r\nThe `ChangeOwnerOnPassenger` trait looks fine, but I would like to see the work on cargo stances and multiple passenger types rounded out a lot more before we merge it.  Doing everything in one PR makes this far too much work to review and test, so I would like to see the work be split across three smaller and more focused PRs:\r\n\r\n1. Add support for passengers entering _and exiting_ transports owned by other players.  For exiting to work properly the OrderValidation trait will need to allow certain whitelisted orders (best exposed via an interface that the `CargoInfo` can implement) to be given to units owned by other players.  The testcase for this can be to enable allied cargo in the standard transports in RA/TD.  I'm happy to explain more about this on IRC if you or anyone else wants to start on this.\r\n\r\n2.  Add support for multiple cargo types as part of a more general fix to make Cargo a `PausableConditionalTrait` (Paused: blocked variant of enter/exit cursor, Disabled: no enter/exit cursor) and `Passenger` a `ConditionalTrait`.  The testcase for this can be to fix the TS subterranean APC.\r\n\r\n3.  Finally, the `ChangeOwnerOnPassenger` changes from here."
