You're using triggers a bit too much and don't use the existing functions to their full potential.\n\nI suspect the reason may be that you didn't properly pick up on the fact that many of the actions you can make actors do are not actually executed right when you call them, but instead are put on a queue of actions that the actors then perform one after the other, asynchronously to what's happening in the lua script. This takes a while to get used to.\n"

The latter was far more annoying to deal with.\n\nI would not of tried something as complex as this if it weren't for the fact that no one seems to have been giving Tiberian Dawn any attention and I saw that release after release TD kept the same old boring incomplete shellmap. Clearly, this is my first time creating anything with Lua and I'm willing to listen to advice and fix things as they come up. \n\nWhile I realize that I may have used a large amount of triggers, I did so out of trial and error. I found that many times a unit would disregard a directive given, that is the primary reason that I have as many triggers as I do. Aside from that, this shellmap isn't as passive as the Red Alert one, it has alot more moving pieces that lead up to the loop of units fighting.\n"
