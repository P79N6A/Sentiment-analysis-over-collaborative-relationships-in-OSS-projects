The \"custom water transport\"  refers to \"LST.IN\" and is a modified water trasport. It had to exhibit modified properties to work with .lua. Most notably a \"rejectsorders\" trait and a call function that the normal transport didn't have.\r\n\r\n\"sry but i couldnt get the mission to run with the current release ... in the lobby it says \"This map is not compatible with the current version of OpenRA\" and \"Start Game\" is greyed out\"\r\n\r\nI will upgrade to latest release.\r\n\r\nOn a related note:\r\nAll the modifcations to this map are created by me with the exception of the music. I use the words \"customized\" and \"modified\" interchangebly."
