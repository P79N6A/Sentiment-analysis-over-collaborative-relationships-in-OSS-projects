For TD itself it won't be visually intruding due to the nature of TD's eco in addition to the new stacking feature. Here's an \"high end\" production example of 11 items produced on 8 slots (9 slots max for TD) for the current PR:\r\n![td2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2715583/24327249/31535ddc-11c4-11e7-93cc-c719ba03bfd0.png)\r\n\r\nD2K looks to need one additional production slot (7 in total) to cover all tabs - currently D2K team games is a spamfest and there's a reasonable chance players get to experience full production capability from time to time.\r\n\r\nTS production tab looks gorgeous, only keeping note on should TS sometime in the future adopt a multi-queue system as TD the production bar would have to be adjusted accordingly.\r\n\r\nI believe the rows on RA/TD would look a bit more attractive with _slightly_ more space between the slots, e.g. 5 pixels space in-between (instead of 3) horizontally and 7-8 pixel space in-between vertically (instead of 5). This would make the field slightly bigger but I think design wise it's worth it."

A standard format could look like this (**NB! MS Paint mock-up**):\r\n![end-bar](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2715583/24331462/47a32330-1235-11e7-9fd7-390177febc01.png)\r\nWith the standard distance between the last slot and the right edge being 32 pixels wide. Without the scroll bar I believe 8 pixels would have been sufficient. \r\n\r\n***edit**: On a side note, a ca. 8 pixel distance between the 'production' and 'support power' slot rows would look consistent as well."

Otherwise the production bar would skip a lot if players hold the production on some facilities while keeping production going for others.

    "body": "All right I'm gonna stretch my neurons here to the moon and back so let me see if I can get the argument going forward.\r\n\r\n_disclaimer: I know jack about coding._\r\n\r\n@pchote So the problem is additional mods coming in with their own production capacity potentially not fitting the related mod's features. Case in point Crystallized Doom's multi queue system providing approximately the same amount of production as the official TD mod, however being tied to the TS mod by default it would inherit the default setup provided for TS thus limiting the usefulness of CD's production info tab's display. Same issue would go for every other custom mod out there related to any of the official mods with a different production setup.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is to implement a one-size-fits-all with functionality that would be able to deliver the information uniformly by allowing different units to be displayed with the same slot, solving the need for excessive amount of slots by fitting objects into pre-determined slot types designated as 'infantry', 'vehicles', 'aircraft' etc. Two or more different vehicles produced simultaneously would then be represented by the one slot alternating back and forth between the two until the slot is back onto 1 unit type. The advantage would be for mod creators to have a functional production info bar display available from the get go.\r\n\r\nAn issue with a uniformed system is the accuracy of portraying real-time information, especially with multi-queues where 3-4 production facilities are represented by a single slot. For units/structures with long build times the result could be satisfactory but the quicker the unit is being produced the harder it would be to follow the information on the info bar. Multiple barracks producing a variety of infantry or production of light vehicles (normally fast built) could be problematic as the slot would likely be noisy at best.\r\n\r\nThe current proposed setup would demand of mod creators to alter the setup to fit their mods production should their mod deviate on that point vs the official mod it is built upon (or a common neutral version). This would require the modder to learn how to modify the production UI themselves, possibly from a pointer found in some documentation somewhere. This would put a certain amount of stress upon the mod creator depending on the procedure to which the production UI is custom tailored towards the mod and to the extent it would have been modified.\r\n\r\nThe advantage with having the production UI demand the modder to customize it would be for the UI to present the information tailored to the mods production system and deliver the information plain to the user (assuming that the modder will have to adjust the UI in the first place). Reliable and viewer friendly production UI custom tailored to the specific mod would better aid the mods promotional value by familiarizing the user more easily to the units, production style and game progression for the games.\r\n\r\n**Uniform production info UI**\r\n:heavy_plus_sign: Easy on modders\r\n:heavy_minus_sign: Limits information\r\n\r\n**Custom production info UI**\r\n:heavy_plus_sign: Accurate information\r\n:heavy_minus_sign: Modders needs to engage the UI\r\n\r\nThis whole comment rests on it actually making sense to which I more or less took a shot in the dark."

I can only hope that there are easy solutions out there regarding UI coding for modders that would make it easier to support that position. Games with relatively obscure, unfamiliar units such as with Crystallized Doom would benefit more from having a production UI that at all times presents its production in a plain and straight-forward manner."
