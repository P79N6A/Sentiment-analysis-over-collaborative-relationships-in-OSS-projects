    "body": "Woohoo, more campaign :)\r\n\r\nI found a couple of minor things,\r\n\r\n(1) the map preview is not aligned correctly.\r\n(2) You can cause a lua exception if you kill the R&D-center before revealing it. (Repro-case: use the visibility cheat and fire with the artilleries from the south; In principle this is of course also possible without cheating, but you would have to remember where to shoot.)\r\n(3) In general I feel like the artilleries are too powerful here. I believe (also I didn't make sure) they had much less range in the original. Point in case: you can kill the R&D basically from the starting location. The helicopter also serves little purpose since your artilleries will do all the killing anyway. I tentatively suggest changing the artillery for another unit with less range. That might make it less true to the original but more fun to play."

I have two more suggestions.\r\n\r\n(1) Perhaps you could add a  lose-condition: all infantry killed before the helicopter arrives. That happened to me while I was playing around.\r\n\r\n(2) I feel this mission is still a bit easy. I think on normal and hard (or at least on hard) the player should start with less units.
