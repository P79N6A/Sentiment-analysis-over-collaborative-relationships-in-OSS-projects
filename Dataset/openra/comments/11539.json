    "body": "Not sure if the 3 tiles are really the problem, pchote told me something about PickAny, that it might be intended. However, the black tiles problem is the real issue here. Try this:\n- start OpenRA, play the cnc mod\n- start the map editor, edit a jungle or snow map\n- select tile 69 in the debris menu(on the first line of tiles)\n- place the tile a number of times.\n\nYou'll see many of the tiles being placed are completely black. Tested this on the newest bleed and I could reproduce it.\n"

    "body": "That template definition is definitely bogus.\n\nThe cause is probably that this tmp has one valid and two empty/black bogus frames. The latter weren't used in the original (or the game fell back to default clear terrain) so it wasn't an issue there, but the correct setup for OpenRA would clearly be to remove the two `Clear` tiles and the `PickAny: True`.\n"
