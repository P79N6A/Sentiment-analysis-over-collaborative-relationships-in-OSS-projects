Maybe have more emphasis on harvesting/protecting harvesters and the limited buildable space.\n"

    "body": "The idea for this shellmap is a year old (I just learned about Git basics and some more things, had no time until my recent unemployment), so obviously it has some holes.\n\nMy intention was to replace the, back then, completely empty and lifeless default shellmap on the release builds, at least temporarily, until an improved version came out, seeing how certain features can understandably be quite low in the priority queue. Or at least, that it could serve as sort of a template or tool for someone to make something nicer. And because I was long overdue since I spoke to people about it, I pushed it as is.\n\nI thought about starport deliveries, but since I didn't know how to script them, I just left it as todo stuff. Carryalls are however in the map. Last release seems to automatically add them to harvesters without me doing anything. And sandworms, from what I've seen, can be ruled in as well without much hassle.\n\nIn any case, I'll see what can I do. I used a custom in-game editor (not done by me) back then, which considerably eased the tediousness of placing stuff or drawing the terrain, but I can't find the source.\n"
