    "body": "My first impression is that it works ok. There are some design issues with the campaign system though. The transmissions selection screen, while nostalgic, has a horribly low resolution. You could fix it or just add to the continue screen which I'd recommend since greyed out continue buttons don't look very good in my opinion. You could also have it detect if there are no campaigns in progress and if so, go straight to new campaign.\n![New Campaign](http://imgur.com/pOqy2WD.png)\n\nAnd when you finish a mission, there should be a continue button when you finish a mission. It can take you straight to the next mission or to the next mission's continue screen. Either way, having to go back to the campaign screen each time should not be intended.\n![Continue](http://imgur.com/VS0GVBJ.png)\n\nEDIT: I'll take my mission complaints elsewhere, I thought you added your own missions for some reason.\n"

    "body": "A few more things: \n- `CampaignWorldLogic`'s constructor is 250 lines. You should either move the logic elsewhere or split that into several methods (actually split in both cases).\n- In `CampaignFactionLogic` the `using` statements are inside the `namespace` block.\n- Whatever fields can be `readonly` should be `readonly`. In `CampaignFactionLogic` those are `videoPlayer`, `cachedMusicVolume` and `chooseTextBg`.\n- You have fields that can be made `consts`\n- Any code specific to a certain mod or faction should not be in the code ([like this](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/7559/files#diff-e671324460e75de044ab4aeed00ba2baR96))\n- Use `var` wherever possible\n- Please keep in mind that even with all the code changes, this will need to be evaluated ingame for any behavior issues and that could lead to more logic changes.\n- I can't speak for all your files, but the namespace of `CampaignFactionLogic`, `CampaignMenuLogic` and `CampaignWorldLogic` is `OpenRA.Mods.RA.Widgets.Logic`. It should be `OpenRA.Mods.Cnc.Widgets.Logic`. Please check the rest of the files you add for incorrect namespaces.\n- Avoid declaring 20 fields on 1 line.\n- This PR should not be adding anything to the project `OpenRA.Mods.RA`. The code should go in either `OpenRA.Mods.Cnc` or `OpenRA.Mods.Common`.\n\nSorry if this list is getting scary. I want to give you as much as possible from the start to spare you the trouble of going through the entire code fixing 1 thing everywhere every time someone finds something they don't like. I think it's less frustrating (from my own experience) to fix the same code as few times as possible, even if that means bigger changes.\n"
