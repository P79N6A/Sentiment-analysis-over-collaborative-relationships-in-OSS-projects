    "body": "I agree this is good for lobby. IMO latency in server browser is different and more colors/seeing pings/stricter range could overall increase performance and experience. Players can choose from hundreds of servers (at least from empty to host a new game). There are several 40 ms and 280 ms servers, both green. Without a choice between them, the risk of caused lag lately is higher due to changing NW utilization (on system or outside) due to less reserve with 280ms server. This would have more impact in case server might adapt performance based on situation. \r\nSelecting better server can save also a lot of time and keep more players - when you join 280ms, it can happen you'll be kicked after 10 min waiting due to latency changing to yellow (and back). For players in a location where most servers have higher pings (currently no indication or green all) to find one good (with stable green in lobby) can be tiresome."
