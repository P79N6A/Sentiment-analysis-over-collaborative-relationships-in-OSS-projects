    "body": "Agreed wrt Artillery - Lowering its weapon range slightly from 14 (to 12?) and lowering `155mm`'s damage versus `None` very slightly could help approaches, also put the unit in more vulnerable positions. I'm assuming `None` is infantry only.\n\nMedium & Heavy tanks - A small HP buff to these would help them \"tank\" better, eating an extra base defense shot or rocket. I think they should be a bit more durable and push into bases better.\n\nMAD re-work - Differentiate it from the demo truck by removing the self destruct and letting it un-deploy. Not sure if it should become a Ukraine unit\n\nBritish Spy - Get rid of this unit completely and move the normal Spy to England. I think the bonuses it grants are pretty decent. Can keep its cheap cost of $250.\n\nRadar Dome stealth - Remove stealth detection from the radar dome. Helps phase transport and hijacker.\n"

    "body": "> What is the actual reason behind this suggestion? \n\nIt was to remove a duplicate unit while further incentivising choosing England, but I hear the controversy on this one.\n\n> Removing the spy from the other two factions is just stupid. Besides the obvious strategic loss there would be no way for Germany or France to detect other spies or cloaked units like the hijacker then.\n\nSure there is: base defenses, radar dome, or radar jammer.\n\n---\n\n@r34ch - Agreed about navy. A couple things in mind are MiG AA, Missile Sub AA, or both. I've had the chance to play with msub's AA. I think the unit would need a cost reduction to make it accessible, and because it's a submerged unit, I had its slow-arse missile target air units. That way it was effective against helicopters or circling yaks parked over water but they could move out of the way if they were attentive. On the other hand it was a bit odd for a slow AA shot, so perhaps give it a normal rocket that explodes in a fairly short range to get the same effect.\n"

    "body": "@cjshmyr I would like to see how AA migs work out considering allies have the longbow.\n\nI'm just not sure about AA msubs because I think there would have to be a compromise somewhere. If it stays late game but with AA capability it isn't solving the mid game problem and would duplicate the migs role in that case. Change the msub to be mid game and more like the destroyer and then Soviets would have to loose their long distance capability to rival the cruiser (or risk the msub being OP)\n\nIts one of those situations where as much as it might cause controversy, for the sake of balance it could be argued that a new unit could be added. But then if that happened, I would argue allies would need a land AA equivalent to the flak - which might even help reduce the basewalking AA issue. And if that happened, you could nerf AA guns instead of buffing SAM sites @ShadowA \n\nThat would be my dream personally, which would finally plug the 'gaps' in each sides defences and make every map playable regardless of faction.\n"
