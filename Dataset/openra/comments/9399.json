    "body": "I've been wanting to revive my super-flexible FNA controls setup project for a while now, which I was designing to handle stuff just like that. I got the core key/button/etc logic working, but I never got around to analog input (thumbsticks, mouse movement, sliders, accelerometers) and differentiating between clicks and drags (handling C&C style \"orders/selection vs box selection\" and \"deselection vs mouse scrolling\" were explicit design goals) or proper (de)serialization. After I dust the bitrot off it, add mouse support, add defaults/profile support (so you can offer defaults of Right-Click Orders and Left-Click Orders), and genericize it so it doesn't rely on any FNA-specific stuff, I'll look into doing that. (This is how I enjoy spending my free time.)\n\nAs a stopgap, I'd recommend right-click orders keeping \"scroll map\" on middle mouse for those used to the ORA default controls, and hardcoding left-click orders to have \"scroll map\" on right-mouse for those used to the Westwood default controls.\n"

    "body": "Now that the joystick option for Mouse 2 is up and running, are there any incentive to work on rebinding the drag-scroll button (standard) from Mouse 3 to Mouse 2? Using Mouse 3 button for drag-scrolling is still awkward. I'm hoping the solution for the joystick option can spill over to this issue.\n\nI understand the joystick was added in the prospect of TS, RA2. I think it's important to note that since the originals had way lower resolutions, the joystick was a more effective means to scroll over big distances. On OpenRA, the drag-scroll is vastly superior for controlling the camera, especially on 720p and up. Together with hotkey binded double-pixeling, most maps can be camera dragged to a pinpoint location in a split second. In the end it might just be a personal preference but I hope there's enough interest to complete this ticket.\n"
