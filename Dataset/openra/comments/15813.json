    "body": "@teinarss I can't test that now but I think it's because selection priority is given to the render player. So if you are spectating from the POV of one of your former allies then the `q` hotkey will select only their units. If you switch to the vision of another player then selection priority goes there. \r\n\r\nI wonder if that should be changed in the case of team game spectators as there is actually no real \"team view\" - it's always from the perspective of one of the team members. I'd say we should leave it like it is as that's how the game works though I've already introduced a kind of exception here for \"Everyone/Shroud off\"."
