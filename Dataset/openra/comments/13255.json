We simply ignore other actors than actors of current player.\r\n\r\nFor (All players view) spectators, should we select all units of all these owners or restrict this feature for only  1 unit selection or only selections where all units belong to the same owner?\r\n~IMO it is sufficient/simplest for hotkey to support in this case only 1 unit selection like for double click so owner is known.~ It is fine to check if all selected units belong to the same owner only if spectating.\r\n\r\n"
