I think these changes make these units fairly viable. \n\nThat said, If more buffs are required then as per usual, people are free to make the changes. I just feel a playtest would be welcome before more adjustments are made.\n\nAs to why I didn't buff the Mig @HenrytheSlav, with good micro you can avoid damage and greatly increase DPS even in its current release state due to the Migs range and turn rate. The current release longbow is just a sitting duck, which is why I buffed it. I tried just reducing the delay between bursts alone but I didn't think it would really help with survivability in comparison to the Mig.\n\nWith a higher burst salvo, you get some interesting micro options and it makes the Mig and Longbow more contrasting units, which I feel fits the overall balance theme of oRA. The LB becomes a somewhat high alpha strike unit that has to tank briefly while the Mig can use distance and deal more continuous damage over a longer period of time.\n"
