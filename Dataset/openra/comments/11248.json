Combinations you mention are quite clear here on two different screens. One callibrated higher-end one and one a cheap smart phone. I'm not saying they don't need change, I just don't want to go in the wrong direction. I know differences should be visible on standard monitor and as far as I can tell I did everything (soft proofing and trying a differnet, cheaper screen) to combat that. Does the difference between those colors becomes any clearer if you fiddle with your setting, like brightness?\n\nAnyway I'll do some more color fiddling and post updates :)\n"
