Seems fine to me.\r\n\r\nSeriously, return fire is the more aggressive hold position but nothing more. It doesn't matter if it \"works\" for mrls and artillery because if you put them in return fire stance, you do it wrong. MRLS/artillery are related to #14816 but I object the assumption that return fire with chasing would be fine because it didn't affect a unit negatively you never would put in return fire stance.\r\n\r\nReturn fire would make sense for stanks for example. Return fire made sense for re-capturing enemy oil derricks (in RA) before the rework of the attack logic. Maybe it makes sense for units in D2k or in the missions. However, I can not imagine of a situation in that you would want your unit in return fire stance to track down the target automatically (and I'm ignoring here that it will die instantly because this is another issue, see #14816). \r\n\r\nIf you want a highly aggressive stance that makes units chase enemies, use attack anything.\r\n\r\n"
