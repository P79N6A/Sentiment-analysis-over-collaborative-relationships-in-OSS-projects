The existing fonts (both in TS and Dune 2000 in fact) only ever reference the first 16 colours anyway, and if Siberian_GRemlin's info is to be followed, that produces nothing but a bunch of identical blacks and identical blues in that file.\r\n- There is an additional file called FONT.BIN, which is basically a remapping table for transforming text saved in Windows-1252 character encoding to the order of characters used in the actual Dune 2000 font files. My font editor contains a custom text encoding class to support this, which has the original FONT.BIN array stored internally. If you give characters to the encoding class, the resulting bytes you get will be the indices to use on the font. Give it font indices, and it'll return the corresponding characters. You will need this to use the Dune 2000 fonts, or at least to reorder their symbols to a more common encoding. Note that this system means that a character on the font is completely inaccessible if it doesn't get mapped in that remap table.  The original FONT.BIN table maps all unsupported characters to the space character.\r\n\r\nThe goal for the Dune 2000 character reordering seems to be for optimization purposes, since all special characters were lined up without gaps in between, the stored data of the font starts behind the space character instead of at character #0, and the space character itself (0x20) is only stored as pixel width in the header. Any space between characters (which is included in the actual images in the WW fonts) is also just a header value in Dune 2000. My classes compensate for that, though; the additional width is added on load (and detected and trimmed off on save). However, seems that this optimizing effort was never really followed through; all characters behind the special ones are _still_ added anyway, even wrapping around to include all those below the space too, up to the full 255 characters (as I said, the space is not included as character), and on top of that, about a kilobyte of pure junk is dumped into the file's header. So yeah, somebody had some nice optimization ideas there, and somebody (else, probably) screwed that up big time somewhere along the way."
