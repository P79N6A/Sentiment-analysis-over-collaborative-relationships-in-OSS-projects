    "body": "@pchote raised that exact problem in the original PR: (read the whole comment chain) https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/11207#discussion_r61749736 when I suggested this same simplification that would've resulted in an error like this.\n\nI think #11721 fell for the same trap whilst solving the desync issue.\n\nIf you call `RemoveSmudge` and then `AddSmudge` again before `TickRender` has a chance to process the dirty cells, you an end up with a \"deleted\" smudge that exists (in the dictionary, but a null `Sprite`) and I'm not sure we updated all the code to handle that correctly. \n\nThis _appears_ to be the right fix according to that train of thought, however, the stack trace in #11922 says that a null value was passed to a dictionary indexer, and I don't see how the current change of checking the for the null `Sprite` helps, as that is not used elsewhere in this method, let alone in an indexer. Hopefully I'm just missing something here and you can point out the flaw in my thinking :).\n\n(I wish we had unit tests for this trait)\n"

    "body": "@RoosterDragon: we use the `Sprite` field as a marker. If it's null, it means the smudge has been deleted, and all its other fields will (or might) be default values as well (null, 0, whatever. In the crash case, `Tile` was dereferenced in the line right below the one touched by this PR). So if `Sprite` is null, we go ahead and select a smudge from the `tiles` array instead, which only contains valid smudges.\n"
