    "body": "@Phrohdoh \"PR: Changes Requested\" states or would state that the functionality the the pull request should/must be changed (more work) while this would imply that the pull request functionally acceptable but needs quick changes to be merged.\nAlthough \"PR: Needs +2\" with \"PR: Changes Requested\" could be used the same way, but would be harder to distinguish especially since someone can add \"PR: Changes Requested\" after \"PR: Needs +2\" and not remove \"PR: Needs +2\" possibly by forgetting.\nBasically, this would say use `git rebase` and/or `git commit --amend` and get done < 1minute.\n\nI wouldn't be against the idea of using this for minor changes that don't invalidate \"PR: Needs +2\". I have had pull requests where one person adds \"PR: Needs +2\" and then someone else adds \"PR: Changes Requested\" and then I consider whether the \"PR: Needs +2\" because of the requested changes. As a minor change label, this would help prioritize pull requests when not having much time.\n\nI have also seen \"PR: Has dependencies\" (and probably \"PR: Changes Requested\") be used for pull requests where the test commit needs to be removed for merging.\n\n@pchote's comment does lessen my enthusiasm about this idea.\n"
