    "body": "The chat itself still can handle repeating keys it just seems an exception to the backspace input has been made, which i think is due to how the widgets handle keyboard shortcuts. - This means that individual widgets require an individual filter as and when required not within the low level platform code.\n\nI'm think this could be done via adding the e.key.repeat value into the KeyInput datatype, this would then mean each widget would need to be refactored to handle whether or not it should respond to key repeat or should be a singular press.\n\nSo I agree with @pchote Its far to low level of an implementation unfortunately, and it should be the widgets that make the decision I think that would be the ideal solution. but it does require a bit of refactoring.\n\nSo back to the drawing board on this one, could we un-merge and i will work on a better solution.\n"
