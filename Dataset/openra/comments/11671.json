    "body": "We've already gone most of the way to implementing #7916 by generalizing the shroud code to support more than just actors (as described in the IRC quote there).  I think it would be a bad idea to take this as-is because it is much more limited than the alternative, has extra perf overheads, and would end up being reverted when the other approach is eventually implemented for its other benefits (removing the need for specific camera actors, and allowing shroud modifiers from lua).\n\nCan you instead please look into replacing the `Actor` arguments to Add and Remove with a more general type, and then have actors spawn a new IEffect class on death that gives visibility for a set amount of time.\n"
