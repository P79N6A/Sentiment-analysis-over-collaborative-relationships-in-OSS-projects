    "body": "The lack of interest in this from other reviewers is concerning, so at this point it looks unlikely that this will make it into the next stable release.  Sorry about that... hopefully we'll address the problem (if it still exists) in the next cycle.\n\nI won't personally :+1: it because I think it is a bad idea to take any balance changes immediately before a release without adequate testing with the other playtest changes.  The last time we took a \"simple\" change without testing it completely broke the C&C mod balance, so I've learned my lesson there.\n\nIn fact, I haven't seen _any_ serious discussion about our playtest balance.  So far the only balance-related comment i've seen was @Unit158 saying that he thought shock troopers had been nerfed too much (despite the fact that they haven't yet changed at all).\n"
