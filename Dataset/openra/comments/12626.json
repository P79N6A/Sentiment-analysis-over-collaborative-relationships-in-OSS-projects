    "body": "Next release will drop the upgrade system in favor of conditions, which will allow you to do this properly (`RequiresCondition: !rank-elite && !deployed` on the standard weapon, `RequiresCondition: rank-elite && !deployed` on the elite weapon and `RequiresCondition: deployed` on the deploy one) but for now, just set so that `DeployedUpgrades` give you 2 `eliteweapon`s besides `deployed` and set `UpgradeMaxAcceptedLevel` to 3 on all armaments, so level 0 means rookie undeployed, level 1 is elite undeployed, level 2 is rookie deployed and level3 is elite deployed.\r\n\r\nNote that while `DeployToUpgrade->DeployedUpgrades` are allowing multiple upgrades to be granted, it's substitute in the next release, `GrantConditionOnDeploy->DeployedCondition` doesn't due to the boolean logic dropping the requirements of such workarounds like the above."

See the [ts tick tank](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/mods/ts/rules/nod-vehicles.yaml#L72) for an example of how to set up a deployer with elite weapons.  See #12380 and the issues/prs that reference it for more info on this change."
