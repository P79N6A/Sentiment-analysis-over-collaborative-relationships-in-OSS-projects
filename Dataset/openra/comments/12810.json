In fact a way more balanced solution would be to give both Allies and Soviets both planes and helicopters since no military force, even fictitious ones would do without all capabilities that provide then an advantage over an opposing force, but I digress. \r\n\r\nThe Hind is a Soviet designed helicopter and is out of place being in the Allied arsenal. As for changing it's art, why not make it a Cobra or UH-1D Huey Gunship instead, in fact the Huey has exact firing locations to match the current art. And give the Soviets their Hind back, it's an iconic unit in an iconic franchise. You wouldn't give the Allies the Mammoth tank right?  \r\n"
