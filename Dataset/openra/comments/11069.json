    "body": "It seems the chance to get an engineer has been fucked with as it is possible to 5 riflemen and 6 engineers from a refinery.\nThis also creates an interesting discussion around which buildings should have the chance to drop engineers. Currently powerplants have a chance and I think that is counter-intuitive as it gives you the $250 sell money and an engineer. Anything over or equal to $1500 should probably give a chance\n"
