    "body": "Some people don't like change.  I remember similar arguments against introducing the base radius, tanks crushing infantry, and even 5 infantry sharing a cell back in the day.  If you are confident that a change will be positive for gameplay then you shouldn't let the nay-sayers scuttle, it unless they can justify their objections with actual logic.\r\n\r\nCalling it \"RA style capturing\" probably isn't helping your cause though.  Call it \"C&C3:KW style capturing\", which it is closer to than RA."

By next release im going to look for games that involve engineers and if I don't see any will present the case once more. Aye though some don't like change but its possible they haven't realized all the changes yet.\r\n\r\nEDIT: @pchote fixed"
