(so i dont really understand the LoS-Buff) ... the speed also doesnt have to match the soviets APC , cause he is still \"invisible\" ... \nif anything , we should work out a better solution \"detecting\" him ... cause all the defense-strucures and radars makes it not really interesting to give it a try (on certain maps) , also ... maybe a buff for the weapon somewhere in the future\n\nthe crono and teslatank buff sounds good ... as \"trade one allies-buff for a soviet-buff\" but ... \n\nwe just recently \"nerfed\" the shocktroopers ... because people (you) moaned about them being too good vs Ukraine ... now out of the sudden we need the \"double-zap\" and no \"ROT\" at all , for TeslaTanks although they are also a russian - faction special ... did you consider Ukraine on this change ? \nhttps://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/pull/9248\n\nyou forget that we have to balance more then 2 factions now ... and when you buff certain \"faction specific units\" then youll most likely unbalance the game ... so im once again the boo-man \n"

    "body": "@MicroJOo I think its a fair point you make about existing balance feedback and of Ukraine. I have left my thoughts on your PR. As for Ukraine, I wouldn't mind the demo truck speed slightly increased so that when it is killed, it'll die a cell or two closer to the intended target - thus being a little more cost effective. That said if you think buffing the TT is too soon after nerfing the other russian faction specific unit I have no issues removing that change until we got feedback. \n\nAs for the phase however, I have to strongly disagree. If anything I feel the changes I propose strengthen its role of 'sneaking in special units'. The speed buffs allow a player to reduce the potential time of being spotted and to exploit temporary gaps in the enemies defences; you know how fast defences are built. The LoS buff allows you to avoid minor base defences much easier -and as such, detection- and the capacity increase allows you to sneak more special units into a base.\n\nThe reason I didn't want to buff the phase's weapon as you hint at is because then it would have too similar a role to the chronotank - hit and run. As you say, they are hard to detect on the battlefield so a good weapon would be OP in the right hands. Their cargo has the ability to cause a lot of damage once deployed, but are visible and fragile - so easily countered.\n\nReally though all this theory-crafting means nothing unless people go and test this stuff. I was however under the impression that a feature freeze did not cover balance so long as a playtest was due before the next release - so that these changes could be tested and if need be, reverted before release. But from what I have read on IRC it appears I am mistaken. I think you had a good idea making a couple 'balance changes maps', so I will try and see if players are willing to play such maps.\n"
