    "body": "I've worked on this a little locally and got these ideas that I'd like to discuss.\n- Right now at most one subclass of `AttackBase` is allowed per actor. Also, exactly one pair of `Cursor` and `OutsideRangeCursor` per `AttackBase` is used. The former (single `AttackBase`) is not necessarily a problem, but the latter (single cursor) probably is - different cursors for attack and buff, different cursors for ground attack and air attack for example... I'd suggest moving `Cursor` and `OutsideRangeCursor` to `Armament`.\n- Related to this, @GraionDilach, is there any specific reason why you'd want the `Beneficial` on the weapon instead of the `Armament`?\n- I imagine then that targeting with the force modifier would in some instances have to discriminate between different available armaments. Right now the force modifier doesn't affect the choice of the armament. It only affects whether or not \"a target is targetable\". However, an armed medic for example might want to normally heal allied units, but when using the force modifier, shoot them. This would be the case with #8563, a tesla trooper would normally want to powerup a tesla coil, but when force targeting it, he might want to zap it.\n- The previous bullet would also relate to auto-targeting. Auto-targeting would then only choose armaments that one would get when manually targeting without the force modifier.\n"

Either way if we'd go with `Benefical` - regardless of place - then indeed, force-attack should ignore it.\n\nMoving the cursors to Armament-level sounds odd to me - that same logic could apply to voices (Yuri's Revenge had such for Magnetron, Boris) however I'm not certain how feasible would either be with OpenRA's system.\n"
