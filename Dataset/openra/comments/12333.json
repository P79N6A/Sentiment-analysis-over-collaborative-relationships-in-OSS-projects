    "body": "@pchote - I have done as you asked, but I realized there is another problem with the code. When an attack is made against a visible actor, it will remain so, even when the actor has become frozen. Also, if an attack is made against a frozen actor, it will be stopped once the actor becomes visible. \n\nMy idea on how to fix this is by modifying `Attack.InnerTick`:\n1. Remove the hack code `if (!attack.Info.IgnoresVisibility && type == TargetType.Actor && !Target.Actor.Info.HasTraitInfo<FrozenUnderFogInfo>() && !self.Owner.CanTargetActor(Target.Actor)` and instead check via the normal `Shroud.IsTargetable`.\n2. When a target becomes invalid, do one of the following:\n   - If the target was an `Actor` with `FrozenUnderFog` and the attacked area is now under fog and there is a new `FrozenActor` at the position where the original `Target` was, create a new `AttackActivity` for it instead.\n   - If the target was a `FrozenActor` and the attacked area is now NOT under fog and there is a new `Actor` at the position where the original `Target` was and the `Actor` also has `FrozenUnderFog` and is of the same building type as the `FrozenActor`, attack it.\n\nNote: I am not sure if I will be able to continue on this since I am entering a busy schedule irl now. I'm leaving this information here for either me or someone else to continue at a later time.\n"
