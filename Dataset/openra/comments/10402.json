    "body": "I don't see too much problem with curret behavior but it would be better if power requirement (not sure is it already removed in orginality changes) and ability to toggle power it. Palaces has Support Powers, Outpost Provides radar. Missile Turret requires Power to Operate, gun turret doesn't.\n\nJust remove it from startport, rest looks good for me.\n"
