They don't care for nostalgia of maps they haven't played before. And if they care for nostalgia, they would surely play the original games.\n\nCurrently some of the maps in the official pool look worse than the maps done by Westwood over 20 years ago...\n\nI'm pretty sure these old maps are the way they are due to lack of tools and early performance reasons. The tools and codebase have caught up, but the most visual impact newer players will experience - the maps - haven't. I think these maps being in the official pool will draw an unfair comparison to the rest of the game (the codebase, balance etc).\n\nI agree with @SoScared that people contributing maps to the game should have their work freely editable as everyone who contributes to the code base. I also think maps going into the official pool should undergo 'map review' before going into the game just like code does.\n\n:+1: for the maps listed\n"

Some maps need balancing but many of them needs an aesthetic overhaul (e.g. actors, ridge formations).\n\n@Micr0Bit : I agree, we should try to keep the classics but imo that requires some of them to be altered. I'll be adding Snowy Ridge to that list. I think holding on to bad maps in favor of better ones (created by equally hard working people, if not harder) is gonna hurt the enthusiasm for making maps.\n"

Besides being a bit \"square-y\" it doesn't look too horrific IMO. \n\n[Breaking Point](http://resource.openra.net/maps/7544/), agreed. 4 vs 4 player on a very small, very choke-y map. Never had a good game on it.\n\n[High and Low Extended](http://resource.openra.net/maps/7357/) (10 players), I might take a stab at tweaking this map.

    "body": "Latest changes, added:\n\n**Breaking Point**: 8 players fighting through 2 narrow chokes. Also it's one of the 'capture the middle or die' kind of maps, but doesn't make it obvious to new or casual players. There's no interest in altering the map either since it would alter the map's original purpose.\n\n**Raraku**: Fugly version of map Caffeinated. See main post on Caffeinated in #10710.\n\n**High & Low Extended**: I altered High & Low (8 players) but I won't for this one. Personally I remember plenty of good fun games on H&L (played big team games quite a lot some years ago) but can't remember one single good game on H&L Extended. These map types prolongs matches that are already decided with little interesting after-play, meaning once one side has an insurmountable lead it becomes tiresome killing off opponents choosing the 'last man standing' policy. Besides from being a bit of a mess, map 'H&L Extended' simply pulls this last point a bit too far.\n"
