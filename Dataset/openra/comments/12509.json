    "body": "@FRenzy-OpenRA That would be the ideal starting point. I've now thought about this for a while, and I think the sweet spot will definitely be in the 10-20% range. But like anything, it will need to be tested by people. and I think how you do that is find a really good micro player and a equally good t0-t1 spammer or basepusher and find the speed where one is complaining and feeling overwhelmed, and dial it a notch back from there. I can already think of a few names, and I'm sure just the series of test games alone would prove a very interesting watch if we could get any of the top tier players involved.\r\n\r\nAlso, \"brisk\" may or may not be suitable for the actual name of the game speed - it was the best word i could come up with at the time.\r\n\r\n\"Fast-ish\" actually appeals to me more now Ive had more time to dwell on this idea."
