This should certaintly be included. Walls got a huge build radius and that's one of the things that makes blocking off chokes way too easy."

    "body": "@ChristianDK Agreed for the most part. As of this PR, these values has been the most straight forward, practical way of playtesting a wall nerf yielding positive results, especially with the next playtest/release being around the corner. They're also focused more towards immediate use of aiding and blocking base defenses.\r\n\r\nWalls being in such a relatively awkward spot in RA I think it would be a simple matter of overriding this PR with future nerf options. Be it a combination with the above or a different solution altogether. That's gonna require someone to go deeper into this issue beyond the next release."
