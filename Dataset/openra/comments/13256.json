It solves these 2 issues, but I am not sure it is the right solution.\r\n1. currently - no change in factions, spawns, course of the game (with AIs only)\r\n2. after change - new factions, spawns, course of the game (as requested here #11190)\r\n\r\nWhen I Restart I am used/expect that setup (factions, spawns,..) stays the same. With at least one human player, it is achieved that course of the game will be different, looks strange to observe the same AI only match, but this is minor issue. (could we randomize only behaviour and keep factions,.. on Restart?)"

The way to fix it is to change [HackyAI.cs#L345](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/bleed/OpenRA.Mods.Common/AI/HackyAI.cs#L345) to be seeded with something that is different each invokation.  `CosmeticRandom` is one such source (`SharedRandom` won't work, because that needs to be synced across all players), or the current time is another."
