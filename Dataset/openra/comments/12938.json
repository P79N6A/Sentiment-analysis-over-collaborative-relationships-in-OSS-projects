    "body": "Oh it gets more interesting, you know how the move command for players kills itself if units can't get to a location rather than following through with the order?  Well the Attack move as well as the AI's Attack Move doesn't have this check so they continue to try and move even when they are unable to get there.  My guess is the AI is spamming Attack Move and the units are spazzing out because while they want to move they can't. Might be some good places to put in checks to see if a structure is in the way it built and to sell the offending structure, or maybe repair destroyed bridges (or destroy them if in the way of naval units)."
