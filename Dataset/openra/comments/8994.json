However the current state of Desura makes this also not a recommendable solution. \n\nEven if we already had https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/issues/8992 in place with some prior experience and proper testing, this would add a gigantic additional burden to the publishing process as even more tasks need to be coordinated.
