Maybe if you get used to it, or because you are the developer makes \"sense\" to you, but the new user trust me can't find it! i have tried it with 5 different friends all said this the 1st time the tried to start a game, \"where is the start?\"\ndont ignore he skirmish players (that are i think the majority on this project), we wish to start a game fast, and the mouse goes down right, only to see that there is nothing there to start the game!\n\nif the back breaks other forms (i tried dune and cnc no issues that i noticed) we could always but it somewhere next to the start game.\n"

    "body": "@JohnnyXP64 in a project like this there is always a balance between \"anyone can contribute\" and \"everything is accepted\", especially when dealing with things like the lobby and sidebar where everyone has their own slightly-different opinion about how they should look and work.  It's important to keep a consistent UI design to avoid the too many cooks problem.  It is usually a good idea to discuss controversial changes on IRC first to avoid reactions like the ones above - the pull request discussions are action-oriented, and this can be misinterpreted as hostility if you're not familiar with it.\n\nWith that out of the way, I agree that the start-game workflow discoverability sucks.  A few proposals have been discussed in IRC over the years to improve this - my favorite is to make the ready checkbox blink after 5 seconds with no configuration changes (which is uncontroversial), and then remove the force-start button (which is controversial).\n"
