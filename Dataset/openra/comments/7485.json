This can be used to give players new opportunities at night, like sneaking through the back door.\nBut don't tie this to the computer's clock. Some people are only able to play after work for example.\nHow about doing something like DotA's (probably Warcraft 3 had it) time system - several minutes of \"day\", followed by several minutes of \"night\" and a clock that shows what time of day it is.\n"
