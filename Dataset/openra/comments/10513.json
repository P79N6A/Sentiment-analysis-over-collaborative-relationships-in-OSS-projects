    "body": "I know. For drawing the basic shape, even a piece of paper is enough :)\n\nHowever, it's difficult to convert your sketch onto a RA map, mostly because of the sense of scale.\n\nI surely am still a noob at map-making, but I find it quite difficult to draw the already sketched map (done with whatever application or on paper) on the map editor. \n\nThe actual process is not fluid enough, or let's say not easy for trial-and-error process.\nYou have to pick different sprites to draw elements like a river, a road, a cliff, etc ... which can be long (at least for a beginner like me). And when you finished drawing the element, you find out it's not the scale you want or it doesn't feel good.\n\nJust an idea I'm throwing out ^_^ but I'm sure this would accelerate map-drawing process, and encourage more people to draw nice maps.\n"
