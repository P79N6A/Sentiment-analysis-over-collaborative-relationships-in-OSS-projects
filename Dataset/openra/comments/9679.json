    "body": "Thanks for the detailed information.\n\n1) Delete these three maps from your maps folder to stop crashing:\n- Engineer_s_Playground-2.oramap\n- protected_crates_in_the_middle-1.oramap\n- SnowyBattle-1.oramap\n\nMaybe someone else can chime in as to why it seems why the game can sync down bogus maps, or if this is a false positive? I'm guessing this is caused by a folder within the oramap.\n\n2) Enemy Nations was by Windward Studios, and the game was freewared/open sourced a long while ago. It looks like there is a project for upgrading it [here](https://launchpad.net/enations), but seems to have been abandoned.\n"
