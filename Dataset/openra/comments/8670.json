    "body": "After some more digging around in the source code I found it a nice challenge to track down what happens with that one tank not teleporting back as it is consequently reproducible using the replay of that game. The debugging I did in the posts above were not the actual problem as they were targeted to other actors. I did not think about how to solve this issue as I am not that familiar with the codebase, only track it down.\n\nSo here comes… \n\n1) First to track the tank itself some code was added to see the ActorId on the screen itself, so the tank is identifiable.\n\n2) Using the ActorId from that one tank it was possible to follow the code that is executed for that tank using conditional breakpoints. It is actually quite nice to see the game in a sort of “Step mode” using the conditional breakpoints.\n\nBelow the start of chronoshift, the current activity gets canceled and the teleport queued.\n![alt](http://i.imgur.com/eOj4dCl.png)\n![alt](http://i.imgur.com/zjIGBv0.png)\n\n3) After some tracking I see the teleport getting executed.\n![alt](http://i.imgur.com/k4h7pR0.png)\n\n4) The tanks have been teleported and a lot of Move… activities are executed. Now its waiting until the units gets teleported back \n![alt](http://i.imgur.com/i9RfgXR.png)\n\n5) Finally the tanks are teleported back (see stack trace), except the one tank (Id 1392). So from here it should get interesting.\n![alt](http://i.imgur.com/izI06x9.png)\n\n6) So the return teleport activity is actually queued as it should be.\n![alt](http://i.imgur.com/IHCUQw0.png)\n\n7) This is where is gets funky, in this specific case an activity is already queued for tank 1392, so its gets set as the next one. This is some kind of recursive tree it seems?\n![alt](http://i.imgur.com/L0An0Fu.png)\n\n8) In the MovePart class the queuing is done, but redirected to another class.\nIn the Cancel function above there is also a call to Base.Cancel. Maybe the call to the base object should also be done on the Queue function to fix this issue?\n![alt](http://i.imgur.com/7Jazyze.png)\n\n9) Jumping to the Activity.cs class itself the same code is present as in Actor.cs to do the NextActivity thing.\n![alt](http://i.imgur.com/9MuvrMw.png)\n\n10) Returning from that function it is seen that the “object” is not actually updated for some reason as can be seen in the Locals window. So no NextActivity is set, and the TelePort activity is probably lost.\n![alt](http://i.imgur.com/iOgdfQ3.png)\n\n11) After this it is obvious that the teleport will not be executed as can be seen from the last screenshots.\n![alt](http://i.imgur.com/tvIxl73.png)\n![alt](http://i.imgur.com/X83Qdma.png)\n![alt](http://i.imgur.com/mGX8WBU.png)\n\nI hope this helps tracking this issue down. From my own experience I know timing or 1 out of 1000 wrongs issues are the best ones. \n"

    "body": "> But I think you were right the first time - according to your earlier screenshots the  Teleport  activity does run, just returns prematurely due to lack of target cells. I will run the replay to verify shortly.\n\nMonitoring the ActorID, these points were hit when the Actor was a husk. In all the cases the Actor was not that one tank (1392), so I ignored those cases.\n\nBut to make the \"teleport not executing\" a bit more strong I took another approach at tracking the code using some non-conditional breakpoits with printing to the Output window.\n\n![alt](http://i.imgur.com/twl20MV.png)\n![alt](http://i.imgur.com/Zn1yGOA.png)\n\nAt the start of the chronosphere, the units are nicely transported to the enemy base. The ActorID's are lining up nicely.\n\n![alt](http://i.imgur.com/dJGbop8.png)\n\nBut when returing the units, we can see that the teleport activity is planned, but not executed as the 1392 ActorId is not being teleported. As seen on the OpenRa window, the husks are still there, but there are not teleported as the BestCell is null, but in case of the tank  1392 the **whole** teleport activity is not executed as can be seen in Output windows.\n\n![alt](http://i.imgur.com/CPKN6wk.png)\n"
