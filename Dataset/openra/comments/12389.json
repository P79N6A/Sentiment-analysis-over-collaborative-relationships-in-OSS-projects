    "body": "`OpenRA/thirdparty/download` has a file `OpenAL-CS.dll.config` which maps the Windows DLLs:\n\n``` xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<configuration>\n    <dllmap dll=\"soft_oal.dll\" os=\"windows\" target=\"soft_oal.dll\"/>\n    <dllmap dll=\"soft_oal.dll\" os=\"osx\" target=\"/System/Library/Frameworks/OpenAL.framework/OpenAL\"/>\n    <dllmap dll=\"soft_oal.dll\" os=\"linux\" target=\"libopenal.so.1\"/>\n</configuration>\n```\n\nCheck if it exists. It should get downloaded via nuget automatically during `make dependencies` and should be copied into the OpenRA root folder during the `make` process.\n\nIf it is there and you still get that error, check if you Arch Linux system still ships a `libopenal.so.1`. Maybe the soname changed during an update. Pacman is rather primitive afaik and can't detect system dependencies like `dpkg` or `rpm` can, so you have to make sure yourself.\n"
