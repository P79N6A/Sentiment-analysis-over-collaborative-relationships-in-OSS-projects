Infantry actually do go prone, but something overrides the prone animation, so they look like they don't (across all 4 mods). @reaperrr tried to work around that not long ago, but the workaround seems to work just half of the time, unfortunately.\n\nWe recently had several changes to selection logic, but I believe that one is because of @obrakmann's change to not be able do double-click-select enemy units (assuming that what you're saying was possible before).\n"
