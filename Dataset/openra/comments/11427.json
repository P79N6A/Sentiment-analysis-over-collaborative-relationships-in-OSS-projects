    "body": "> I assume the issue with the upgrade rules is knowing where to add the cruise upgrade without accidentally overwriting any existing definitions, right?\n\nThat's just the icing on the cake. \nWhat put me off far more is that actors might have one rotor overlay without `@` separator, one with and one without, two with them, or even more than two. And each of them would need to be split into two idle overlays, so I'd have to make sure the upgrade rule won't write duplicate separators anywhere.\n\nI just think that'd be far too much work for something that will rarely affect more than 2 or 3 actors per mod.\n\n> Personally, I would have the rule swap the rendering traits and then write a message prompting the upgrades to be set manually.\n\nI'll do that, then. Modders can take the manually fixed rules from our mods as reference, afterall.\n"
