    "body": "While it doesn't affect this PR directly, I have a strong caution about how I assume you are using this in your mod code:  You said in IRC that you want to use this for positioning turrets on actors.  Turret positions are important for the simulation state (since it controls where projectiles are fired from), but Sprite objects are only available from the rendering code.  Rendering is decoupled from simulation, and the game will desync in multiplayer if you try to modify simulation state from render code."

    "body": "About the usage: We talked about that on IRC, and i will find a better way to archive my goal. However, the usage for this PR is simple: Allow per-frame custom properties to be set. Here is an usecase:\r\n![spriteswithpoints](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1322277/24838834/2d7f0a8e-1d50-11e7-8951-ff3d629b8dd9.gif)\r\nThis vehicle for example \"hops\" while moving. The turret has to be reposition for every frame - but should not affect the logic. For the logic part, the turret has to stay at the center to have the same range in all directions. This custom data has to be present on frame level, which is what this PR allows you to do. This PR is an requirement before i can teach the renderer how to correctly handle this information."
