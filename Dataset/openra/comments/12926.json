    "body": "The solution for this issue, could possibly fix the turret-follow-issue (#12856).\r\n\r\nSo that if the enemy is out of weapon range and the unit cannot follow the enemy even if it is in sight (because it is a tower/structure/immobilized) or the enemy is out of sight, it will stop \"targeting\" it."
