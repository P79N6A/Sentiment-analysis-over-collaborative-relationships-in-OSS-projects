Building 3 MAD tanks will be too much time / money consuming comparing to a Demo truck, maybe 2 MAD would make it a more useful unit.\n\nOn the other hand, I'd understand that it would become an OP unit, coupled with IC or chrono. Also it can take a lot more damage, like other tanks (almost like a Mammoth tank ?)\n\nBut still maybe buff it a bit could be nice :)\n"
