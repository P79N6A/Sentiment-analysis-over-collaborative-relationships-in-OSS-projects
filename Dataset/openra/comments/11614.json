To group path this so we only path once.\n2. Drop the order if inaccessible.\n3. Move to the closest cell to the target and if its still inaccessible drop the order.\n\nNumber 1 would be the best as we preserve the order that the player gave but we would need to implement formations and formation moving with compensation for inaccessible terrain, this might break something too since the movement code is finicky at best.\n"
