    "body": "hello,\n\nMy setup:\n- OpenRa-Version: release-20161015 (plus the last 3 releases (playtest + stable))\n- OS: Debian 8\n- GPU: Amd\n- GPU-Driver: fglrx\n- Chromium-Version: 53 (from debian repo)\n\nI have this error as well and I can reproduce it.\n\nIf I start OpenRa while Chromium (HWA active) is already running, render and graphic glitches can/will appear (see examples below). If I close Chromium and restart OpenRa the glitches are gone (Chromium is not running at this time).\n\nA quick test showed that with Chromium HWA deactivated non of these errors appear for me.\n\nIn my opinion Chromium somehow corrupts the rendering of OpenRa (no idea how this is possible but I would like to know :) ). \nSo it could be due to a strange connection between Openra + Amd Hardware + Linux Amd Driver + Chromium Hardware Acceleration. \n\nIt is not a real issue for me but maybe this report helps you somehow. \n\nPS: If I remember correctly I read  that Chromium has some problems with AMD GPUs + Linux Drivers somewhere :/\n\nHWA ... Hardware Acceleration\n\nExamples:\n![screenshot1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20945684/19420610/12166f16-93ef-11e6-87da-886d64552ffd.png)\n![screenshot2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/20945684/19420647/1100de1c-93f0-11e6-939c-e2eb7d639682.png)\n"
