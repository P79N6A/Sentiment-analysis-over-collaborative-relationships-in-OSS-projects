We had previously worked around this for superweapons and other high-damage weapons by multiplying the damage falloff by 10 and dividing the base damage to compensate, but this is now going to be a problem everywhere.\n\nI now believe that this is the wrong solution that makes our problems worse instead of better.\n"
