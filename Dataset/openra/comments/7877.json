    "body": "I'm able to occasionally reproduce the missing mouse cursor. It _seems_ to happen when you switch to a mod having had hardware cursors on, but after you load software cursors have become active instead (I believe this is a fallback mechanism for when hardware cursors fail sometimes). Switching mod again brings the cursors back. I bet the missing cursors is really the same error as #7942 though.\n\nI can't ever reproduce the screwed up graphics. But I imagine @pchote is on the right lines about one of my changes trashing something on the GPU. @pi99y is this issue reproducible on the release from 2014-10-29? That would help us determine if we changed something that broke it or if it really is something off on your system in particular.\n"
