    "body": "Firstly, I am going to go ahead and blame your video driver (window manager would be funnier though), since this isn't happening on other OS-es.\n\nSecondly mission choosing will come eventually, when we support campaign progression. I don't understand what issues you see with the commando, engineers, tech levels or future missions (current mission scripting?).\n\nThirdly a third faction will not happen in the \"classic\" (although rebalanced) TD mod. But worry not, there would be plenty of Scrin in upcoming (thirdparty) TS-based mods.\n"
