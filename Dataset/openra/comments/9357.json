Not sure how to do this. (Would like to make this an Info setting.)\"\n\nI was thinking of making a GuidedLineImpactProjectile, which does not have an inaccuracy attribute, but rather can be set to have its target track the targeted actor (if an actor is targeted), either while its tail is still emitting, or while the projectile is alive at all (i.e. tail has already left the source's barrel.)\n\nWould this make sense? Or should I rather just have a \"Guided\" attribute on the current projectile, which overwrites the inaccuracy if any?\n"

    "body": "> There is a .HorizontalLengthSquared property for calculating only the x and y components.\n\nExcellent, that will help a lot.\n\n> [number] / [larger number] will always return 0.\n\nYes, I had that issue in the first round of trying integer only. (The effect is rather obvious in game, as only actors close to the 'head' and 'tail' of the ray are intersected. None along the ray length are intersected.) I've managed to avoid that this round.\n\nI've currently done the following:\n`// Should be dist = (target - source).LengthSquared;`\n`// But in order to avoid floating points, we do not divide here, but rather work with the large numbers as far as possible.`\n`var dist = 1;`\n`var ans = (xDiff + yDiff) / dist;`\n\nAnd then only divide here, after first multiplying:\n`// Using floating points, this would be: var newX = (int)((double)target.X + t * (double)(source.X - target.X));`\n`// where t would already be divided by squaredLength.`\n`var newX = (int)(target.X + (t * (source.X - target.X) / squaredLength));`\n`var newY = (int)(target.Y + (t * (source.Y - target.Y) / squaredLength));`\n\nI used `Log.Write` to log the steps of the calculation along the way, and it was returning values close to what the floating point math had returned.\n\nI'll implement the \\* 1024 factor and do the same, and see if the accuracy improves.\n"

But otherwise I'd rather leave it for the follow-up PR that will implement the HomingLineImpactProjectile. (I.e. the way the TS disruptors are supposed to track their target with their beam, even if the target moves.)\n\n@matija-hustic I've added the `outOfWeaponRange` check so 'long duration' beams (such as TS disruptors) should now stop firing when you move the unit out of range while it is firing.\n\nRegarding the other issue (zero length beams being fired) I had reproduced it, but since the changes for the `outOfWeaponRange` check I have not yet encountered it again (despite trying).\nSo I believe that has been fixed as well, but please also try and reproduce this again.\n"

    "body": "@reaperrr Allright, the only thing I could spot is this\n(in LineImpactProjectile.cs)\n\n```\nyield return new BeamRenderable(headPos, 0, tailPos - headPos, info.BeamRenderWidth, color);\n```\n\nwhere `info.BeamRenderWidth` is an `int` but the `BeamRenderable` takes a `float` for width.\n\nCould you try to change the line to\n\n```\nyield return new BeamRenderable(headPos, 0, tailPos - headPos, (float)info.BeamRenderWidth, color);\n```\n\nAdding the float cast, and see if that makes any difference?\n(Tried it on my side, still renders the same for me even if I do that. But I'm thinking that perhaps the implicit casts to float might differ across systems?.)\n"
