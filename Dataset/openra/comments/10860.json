    "body": "We noted this on a few maps we've played - once the bridges are destroyed, the AI freaks out and the game grinds to 1/10th speed about while the AI appears to go into some mad loop trying to find pathing. Very much appears to be harvester driven - as the AI is desperately trying to harvest your ore / when harvesters are destroyed, the game speeds up. (This may be a coincidence, however)\r\n\r\nHere you can see how slow the tick rate is compared to IRL. There is even a path on the sides, but the AI appears to not be able to deal with it.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/TYwjypiwsDg?t=3446"
