    "body": "Previous discussion at #3816.\n\nA refinery currently stores $2000 worth of resources in both TD & RA, and players build a handful of these anyways. Some careful thought is required for adjusting capacity - a pro player constantly spends $ and might not be affected, while less experienced players are hit with a resource macro game.\n\nIt's also possible that when you've hit full resource capacity to just spend the money, and refund it to get back cash (which won't count towards capacity), which I feel would be abused if silos were actually needed. Silos might make sense if they refund the type of resource originally spent, but I think silos in all are just a flawed concept :-1:\n"
