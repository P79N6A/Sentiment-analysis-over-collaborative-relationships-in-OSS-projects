    "body": "I know i don't know much abut coding but this sounded like an easy fix to me, just the carryall already works as expected when lifting unit, when both plane or heli, so same thing should be codded for putting unit back. \n\nNote that problem is not plane is vertically landing, i'm fine with that. I would love to see it take off normally as it does when first built and after lifting unit when placing unit too like a STOVL plane.\n"
