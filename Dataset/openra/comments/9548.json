    "body": "The issue with a 1:1 relationship is that we don't have a way for specifying cell+subcell pairs.  It would be simpler IMO to define just the footprint of valid cells (e.g. `CVec[] Offsets`) and then spawn the units randomly within those.\r\n\r\nIn any case this should be sharing at least the user facing behaviour but ideally also the code with `SpawnActorsOnSell`. We could pull out a base class like we do for `AffectsShroud` or have a single trait that has an enum for `EmitType.Sell`, `EmitType.Destroyed`, etc."
