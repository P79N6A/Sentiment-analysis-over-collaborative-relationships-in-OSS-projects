    "body": "As an addition to the pathfinding issue, I noticed that AI \"players\" in skirmish/multiplayer have a habit of actively seeking out all \"Creep\" actors on a map until they are wiped out.\r\nFor example, in RA, I made a map that featured Creep Attack Dogs as \"wolves\" and even though I had FoW and shroud enabled, I could hear Hinds scouting around the map killing all of the dogs.\r\n\r\nIn TD, I played a match on a map that had towers defending a Hospital and Oil Derricks. The enemy AI (again) flocked to those locations first to destroy all the defenses before going about it's usual business.\r\nI heard the upcoming update was going to fix some of the issues with the AI being able to tell where everything was through the shroud but, I hope that also applies for their habit of sweeping maps clean of Creeps.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "I saw a similar thing when playing on maps that rely heavily on crossing bridges and shallows, I noticed the AI places bridges as the top priority and outright ignored the shallow crossings as if they were recognized as just river tiles (which they are recognized as in CNC). The only time the AI attempts to cross with the shallows is if all accessible bridges in their immediate path are destroyed but, even then, some rogue units would still shuffle around by the destroyed bridge almost like they can't process the bridge being gone.\r\n\r\n![river 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25542788/25545314/33c8b922-2c2c-11e7-9f5a-9e04c0fba80b.png)\r\n(screenshot taken in the current build)\r\nThe (AI controlled) infantry by the river crossing scrambled in place for about a minute before \"retreating\" to use the bridge instead. Not one of them crossed. \r\n\r\nThe \"detouring\" isn't as rampant since the update but, it does still happen.\r\n\r\nFaster units also still \"hump\" units that they are assigned to \"guard\" rather than giving them some breathing room.  At the same time, I don't think they actually seek out attackers if they're out of range; letting the unit they're \"defending\" get destroyed instead of trying to hunt for the target. \r\n\r\nFor example: Any vehicle assigned to escort Harvesters or Ore Trucks.\r\n![personal space](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/25542788/25549253/d5093cb4-2c3e-11e7-975b-0960fe04fb50.png)\r\n(screenshot taken in the current build)\r\nI know this was an issue in the previous build but, not to sure if they really \"guard\" yet. \r\nThe AI, however, they'll drop whatever they're doing to hunt you down if you hit one of their buildings or their Harvester more than 2 or 3 times. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
