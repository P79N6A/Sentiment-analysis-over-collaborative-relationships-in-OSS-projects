    "body": "As a RA95 nostalgia tripper I've always hoped for OpenRA to include the RA campaign as close to original as possible. Although no experience in code/scripting I can imagine the tediousness of forcing the ora engine to work flawlessly with original mechanics that in many ways made the missions to what they are.\r\n\r\nOP sounds like a big refresher and I guess a ton of possibilities. If called upon I'll gladly do play-through/feedback until I'm blue in the face."

    "body": "I feel quite strongly the opposite: it doesn't make sense for our singleplayer campaigns to have fundamentally different gameplay/balance to the MP (e.g. Tanya C4ing vehicles, different engineer behaviour on some missions but not others, conyard undeploy).\r\n\r\nIf people want to build a completely authentic campaign, then that is best implemented in a \"ra classic\" mod that includes the same classic balancing in MP too.  Having to maintain both rulesets in the RA mod would be a nightmare.  We are also lacking authentic implementations of many classic features, so it would be very difficult to do direct gameplay ports of the missions in any case.\r\n\r\nIMO this is best achieved by a combination of mission rebalancing (e.g. replacing soviet hinds with yaks, adjusting enemy unit forces to provide an appropriate difficulty level with the new balance, tweaking map design wrt base areas and ore fields) *and* tweaking our RA MP gameplay to better fit with SP requirements (e.g. adding a \"MCV redeploy\" checkbox so that disabling it in SP isn't out of place, keeping external engineer capture but make them be consumed after capturing, and so on)."

    "body": "One of the problems is the AI functionality. The AI is really dumb right now. (It builds 2-3 power plants right at the start for example.) So the AI itself needs a lot of work. Doing this would bring longevity in both MP vs bot games and SP. This would also make the campaigns more challenging.\r\n\r\nHaving the original RA classic with its tech trees and units wouldn't be as fun because artillery ranges would be terrible in one example. Giving the units the same mechanics as the MP counter part teaches the new players what the unit can and can't do. But this as mentioned is hampered due to the limitations of the AI."

I don't know how I feel about allowing redeployment on some missions and not on others. Plus, it is extremely easy to fortify the two beaches then with like 10 pillboxes/turrets each, but turtling is okay with rules I guess. Just not very good for preparing people for MP.\r\n\r\nI also like the backside attack that drops paratroopers in your \"old\" base there. One question though, I don't know where from do the Badgers come in, but it would be probably more fair to end them from allied side than directly from your back, since that just makes player AA useles (for this case)."

You have limited forces, you are not ovberly stronger than enemy base, they have barracks, so you need to eliminate that before you are overwhelmed, they have some tanks/defensive structures, so you need to use cover of armored forces for your strongest force (rocket soldiers) to take them down.\r\n\r\nAfter eliminating the enemy, MCV could be provided, either from north or to give this more of a plausability, from southeast sea. Then the mission follows original tracks.\r\n\r\nI know the change is not small, but it teaches player how to organize forces well and use them tactivally. Throwing the starting force on enemy should result in likely defeat.\r\n\r\nPlease, consider this, and possibly join us on irc too for discussion. :)\r\n"

Yoou can find it on [this branch](https://github.com/HenrytheSlav/OpenRA/tree/alternative_a06a). \r\n\r\nMain changes - varying starting force depending on difficulty, starting without mcv, so you have to get radar to get it. Us armor as cover for your strong units (rocketmen). On easy you get arty to make it..easy.\r\n\r\nAnother point I want to show is giving hints about \"advanced\" gameplay, like disguising spies, turning power down etc.\r\n\r\nAfter you get MCV (and build a spy) the game continues as usual. Enemy attacks are a bit lwoered because they are absurdly strong in original.\r\n"
