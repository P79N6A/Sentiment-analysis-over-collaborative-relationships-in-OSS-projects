(note! uninstalling the game doesn't delete this file)\n\nTo the Dev's, i found out that the audio output default is set to \"disabled\"  (https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/blob/86620888fd5f8f0604de9b5f7b67050c45fc06c5/OpenRA.Platforms.Default/OpenAlSoundEngine.cs#L27), for some reason though there is a bug where if it is set to output disabled then the other options including default will no longer appear in the output selection tab. \n"
