Is this the same thing you done?\r\n\r\nHowever there is also another issue I've noticed when testing, where if you are moving the mouse around quickly and right clicking, for example if you are guiding a yak around, it moves the camera because it is triggering the right-click joystick.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is another issue entirely, but was going to see if it was easy to fix. The only thought I've had is maybe have a time delay or something?"
