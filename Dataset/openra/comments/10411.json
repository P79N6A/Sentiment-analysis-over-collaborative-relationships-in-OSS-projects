    "body": "I've been on the fence for a while but I'm leaning towards a big no on this.\n\nThe stated scenario above is played out on Sidestep where the artillery is literally wiped out of the meta. The nerf in view range would almost exclusively affect situations where you want to stay active out on the map. Why make the artillery more of a liability.\n\nSituations where you move out with infantry and artillery are being slammed and forcing players to mix in rangers, or wait for additional expensive tech to move out early with artillery sounds sounds like a terrible idea.\n\n I don't really buy into this 'artillery is blind' theory either. It's expensive (1800, Radar tech and 800 per unit) and it's a _tank_. A tank made of bubblewrap, but a tank nevertheless.\n\nPerhaps I'm missing something here but the effect, no matter how small, looks to be exclusively negative for the game balance. Leave the view range at 5.\n\n:-1: \n"
