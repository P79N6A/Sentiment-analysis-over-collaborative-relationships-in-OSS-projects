    "body": "I may be missing something, but https://sourceforge.net/p/nsis/bugs/1125/ doesn't look like a big deal for us.  It lets someone inject code into an unmodified installer, but still requires the user to run that with elevated priviledges.\n\nIf an attacker wanted to do something malicious it would be much easier fr them to modify our installer source to do it directly, they don't need to exploit this bug.  We don't sign our installers or make any other guarantees that our installer is trustworthy, so this falls under the usual \"be careful about what you install from the internet\" common sense.  \n"
