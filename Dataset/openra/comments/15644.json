Rather than taking things away from people who don't register, it's nice to incentivize people with features that wouldn't otherwise be possible without an account.  Would also (hopefully) encourage positive friendly interaction.  Does anyone see a feasible way to implement this?"

In principle we could have the game client piggyback on this to show what they are doing, but there are a number of issues that would need to be resolved (e.g. how to prevent trolls from abusing this to track someone who they want to target) and a proper specification outlined.\r\n\r\nThis would also require changes to the privacy policy, as it would mean explicitly tracking what servers each player is connecting to, and sharing it with others."
