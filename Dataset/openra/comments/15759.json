    "body": "IMO desert buildings should use the desert palette, regardless of the terrain. Not that anyone would want to use them on non-desert tileset, but still better for them to look correct on other tilesets too.\r\n\r\nSo the desert palette should be fixed so it is the same as terrain-desert."
