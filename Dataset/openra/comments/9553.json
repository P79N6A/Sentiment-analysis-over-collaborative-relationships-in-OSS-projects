    "body": ":-1: I'd hate to see this map removed. It's one of the most visually pleasing maps we ship. ETA: And I think the visuals of a map should be an important factor when deciding whether to ship a map or not. I'd go ballistic if someone suggested to include one of the *divides.\n\nIf the problem is that new players aren't aware of what the game mode a map is for, the solution isn't to rip out that game mode, but to make the information more obvious. Could be part of the lobby re-write, that's currently happening.\n"

    "body": "this issue isnt about the visually appearance of the map ... its about a gameplay-problem ...\nits a really old map , and the rules on it doesnt make it enjoyable at all .. with a  2-minute time-limit for the tactical win ... and we have to deal with all sorts of problems .. the lack of naval balance for example ... \n\nyou could instead of \"ripping\" it out ... just move it to \"custom maps\" and let people download it from our ressource center ... \n\nand in your specific case , @obrakmann ... because the map is oh such a visually firework of beautifulness ... could just remove the rules and make it a conquest map\n"
