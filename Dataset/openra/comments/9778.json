    "body": "Hi,\n\nSince in OpenRA Chronoshift has been updated, I thought about what could be the requirements for the Chrono Vortex.\n\nHere're adaptations I have in mind compared to the original Vortex.\n\n1) Loading time is lower than in original game, odds to have a Vortex appearing shall be reduced accordingly.\n2) Several units can be Chronoshifted. We could use this parameter to calculate Vortex life time. E.g. if 3 units are chronoshited, Vortex would disappear after 3 min, or after having killed / destroyed 3 units / buildings.\n\nOf course some general behaviour of a Vortex can still apply like :\n- It spawns at a random location ;\n- It slowly and randomly moves ;\n- Only 1 Vortex at the same moment on the map (or more crazy :if a 2nd has to appear when 1 is already in game, both are vanished instantly).\n- ...\n\nFor Chronotank,\n- The Chronoshift weapon has smaller range and a lower loading time. Lower loading time could lead to a lower chance to have a Vortex.\n- As of duration here above maximum duration would be 1 min. or 1 kill.\n- As Chronoshift from Chronotank has a lower range, we could make it less powerful : e.g. cannot attack structures...\n\nI really think it could be a nice stuff to adapt the Vortex to the new rules introduced by OpenRA.\n"

RNG damage like that flat out sucks imho.\n\nBut I guess that's fairly boring.\n\nIf it does do 'something' it would be far more interesting to have it permanently chronoshift any vehicle it comes across to a random point on the map (reusing the chronocrate logic from SS if/when implemented) up to a low maximum (1~3 units) before it dissipates - if it doesn't dissipate before then. \n\nApart from making slightly more sense from an in-universe pov, there is a fairly good chance you can simply move the unit back. At worst, you get a laugh seeing an ore truck stuck on an island or on top of a ridge.\n\nThis ability is already somewhat hinted at the very bottom of http://cnc.wikia.com/wiki/Chrono_vortex#In-game\n\nThe RNG issue with that is of course demo trucks and infantry in transports but you could allow those units to be transported ok from a vortex. This is turn would be a nod to in-universe canon where by the next world war, such issues have been ironed out by the new chronosphere.\n\nhttp://cnc.wikia.com/wiki/Chronosphere_(Red_Alert_2)#In-game\nhttp://cnc.wikia.com/wiki/Demolition_truck_(Red_Alert_2)#Usage\n\nThe implied link would be that scientists studied chrono vortexes after the RA1 second world war and how demo trucks and transports with passengers weren't affected.\n\nMight lead to some interesting games of people deliberately driving such units (inc MCVs) into a vortex.\n"

    "body": "what about if the vortex appeared at the location where the units we're chronoshifted from - almost like the physics of chronoshifting has a direct effect on the physical space the units are shifted from, and only lasted as long as the chronoshift. its behavior could be that it does damage to anything in the general area it was chronoshifted from, maybe 8 cell radius, but was unlikely to take out anything with more health than a powerplant. infantry should be killed(sucked into it), as should planes and helis, tanks should live if they have more armor than a flak or a ranger. However, germany's one should maybe do more damage or move faster, or have a larger range, because of the larger chrono shift.\r\n\r\nthis would have an interesting effect on the strategy of chronoshifting, it would mean when surrounded by the enemy, chronoshifting your unit away would be advantageous, as the vortex would damage your enemy, but when chronoshifting from your own base, you'd have to be careful not to damage your own stuff.\r\n\r\nRe-chronoing already chrono'd units would create another vortex. and would mean that an attempted nuke snipe with chrono'd units close to the silo may be chrono'd away, but the vortex has the possibility of damaging the target anyway.

    "body": "the reason the original red alert had the chrono vortex was to balance the nuke like ability the allied players had. how many times have you seen entire bases popup from no ware behind your base OR inside your base? the answer is countless,not to mention Germany that can teleport an entire army, and what about using chrono to teleport soviet mad tanks in team games? \r\n\r\nohh no sir this is game breaking.we need something to counter this. \r\nlike the original, after this X cumulative number a chrono is used by a player,bring the vortex and wreak havoc to that player. \r\nadd some sound hints to grow in volume to make the player aware that hes close to bring the vortex to his face ehm base i mean. make the vortex to \"attack move\" to the last known position of the chronosphere  building and fade the vortex away after it reach its destination.
