    "body": "Not really a fan of an MP ant faction per se, but if someone made a **quality** mini campaign to play as the ants I would _much_ prefer that.\n\n**1) A new world**\nEscape the soviet a-bomb test range as a lone giant ant. Dodge nukes, soviet infantry and tanks. \n\nThe mission name is a reference to a quote in 'Them!';\n_\"Nobody knows, Robert. When Man entered the atomic age, he opened a door into a new world. What we'll eventually find in that new world, nobody can predict.\"_\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047573/trivia?tab=qt&ref_=tt_trv_qu\n\n**2) Polymorphism** (or Morphology - sounds a little better)\nEat _lots_ of civilians to evolve the ant; scout -> warrior -> queen. Soviets will try to protect the villages at first to slow you down. Then they will simply destroy them with infantry and yaks (much like Soviet mission 1). As you evolve, soviets throw armour at you.\n\nThe civilians as 'economy' is reference to the PSX cheat 'Soylent Green' where ore is turned into civilians. This would be an extension of the current 'bounty' system already in place in oRA for killing units - in this case higher income per unit and both hostile and neutral units.\nhttp://uk.ign.com/cheats/games/command-and-conquer-red-alert-retaliation-ps-3785\nMission name a reference to OOP coding and the entry in Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant#Polymorphism\n\n**3) God save the Queen**\nUnable to find shelter underground, the queen ant has laid larvae above ground in a valley. Some have hatched already. You must fend off soviet ground and later air attacks for 30 minutes. You will need economy to 'produce' more ants from the hills. There is a small village and town nearby. Also a number of soviet bases including an air base. Ants donâ€™t have AA so will have to attack this base or loose. Rivers and bridges give access to this economy (much like ant mission 2). Soviets have access to the scientist which will attack the hills at point blank (not ants) and 'gas' them out rendering them unusable (like the second last ant mission).\n\nMission name is a reference to the fact that the ant missions in the PSX game are located in England on the mission selection map (even though the final ant missions are not located here...)\n\n**3) Retaliation (or CounterStrike)**\nHills have been strategically placed around the map to create forces to pincer the Soviet Base. Gain economy by attacking small villages. Cut off soviet reinforcements by taking out the bridges. Cut off soviet economy by attacking the ore fields and oil derricks. Finally assault the heavily defended soviet base (the one seen in the second last ant mission). Soviets will have access to the chem trooper which is a ranged and more durable version of the scientist. Extremely effective against ants as well as hills.\n\nMission name is reference to the PSX expansion which rolled Aftermath and Counterstrike into one)\n\n**4) The colony**\nClear out the humans from the heavily defended underground soviet research facility (the one in the last ant mission, but much larger). You get a strike force of ants and reinforcements at different times and access points as you clear them. The first wave soviets will simply throw a meatshield at you (for the lolz). Rifle infantry, dogs, flamers - even scientists. Nuclear reactors which kill human infantry and damage vehicles (oRA damage tiles) will heal ants to add some strategy.\n\nAs you continue you see the 'mad experiments' the soviets were developing (a reference to that mission with the chronosphere causing units to have crazy weapons) Chem troopers will exist en mass and the chem tank will see action (TD flame tank firing chem spray). At the end soviets will have modified flame towers to fire chem spray instead of fire. At this point you keep getting loads of reinforcements but soviets will throw _everything_ at you -  Demo trucks, MAD tanks, Mammoths, heavies etc - even a prototype volkov.\n\nWhen you get to the end you will see a large underground room will nothing but gems and a space in the middle. This is a reference to the community ToX maps (tons of gems, tons of units spammed). In the middle of the room is a clearing for the Queen ant to get to to complete the mission - and set up the canon for the original ant missions. \n\nReference to the Cylon 'homeworld' in Battlestar Galactica\n\n**Ant units**\n\nScout\nWarrior\nFire\nTesla (dark blue - already fan made somewhere)\nChem (dark green)\nQueen\n\nThe upside to a mini-campaign is that all of it can be done already or will be soon (tiles giving damage I think is a future PR?)\n"

I'm sure there are ways to ensure that they are not disturbing the other factions, or the game experience. \nDue to the limitations of the units & buildings they should not be a threat to the deep metagameplay of the other factions in any way.\n"

Many buildings to capture.\nAnts start with barracks which can build units each having different build speeds.\nIn the map I modified the ant to be 4 build-able units:\nThey are distinguished by their size as that was the only thing I could figure out how to change visually.\n\nQueen ant: M.a.d. tank type unit which can heal the other ants\nElectric ant: Uses similar attack to teals tank\nFlying ant: flies like a heli, shoots flame attacks against infantry and missiles against air units.\nRegular ant: uses bite attack, these guys are small and easy to get big quantities of.\n\nedit: looks like i need to edit the yaml a bit to get it playable in this current release.\n"
