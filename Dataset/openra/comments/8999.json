I believe we recently changed MixFile to stream instead of copying, and a similar fix could be made here.  IMO to qualify for the bounty we should fix this generally across the engine / filesystem instead of accepting just a specific zip fix.\n"

The way SharpZipLib works internally doesn't seem to be compatible with the way we want to load and access the zip contents, so we have been forced to buffer both the input and output with MemoryStreams to avoid issues.  The output interface is indeed a stream, but this is just a wrapper around the full copy of the decompressed file in memory... this issue is essentially  about replacing that with on-the-fly decompression.\n"
