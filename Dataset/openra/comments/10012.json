Your own units should \"identify/comply or die\" :) \n- Spies now also detect spies, no?\n"

Yes, because I assume that if you don't require force-fire, you also automatically get the \"enemy\" cursor. And no, because the current spy behaviour has been tested very well (many players do use spies these days and I never seen anyone complaining, including the spy users). My main point is that it should stay as it is in the latest release.\n\nCheers :)\n"
