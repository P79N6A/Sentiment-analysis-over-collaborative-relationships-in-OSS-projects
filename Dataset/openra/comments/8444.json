    "body": "This is a trait construction order issue at its core.\n\nThe problem is that when `UpgradeManager.GrantUpgrade` gets called to grant the `eliteweapons` upgrade, the `Armament` traits are not present in the lazy `UpgradeManager.upgrades` dictionary. This is because this dictionary enumerates all constructed traits implementing `IUpgradable` at the time of its first use. And in this particular case, when `^Vehicle.TimedUpgradeBar` gets constructed, it accesses `UpgradeManager.upgrades` thus enumerating only traits that have been constructed up until that moment. And it just so happens that `Armaments` haven't yet been constructed.\n\nIf the `IUpgradable` interface is here to stay and this cannot be resolved through `Requires<>`, then a constraint on the use of `UpgradeManager` should be made, forbidding any access to `UpgradeManager.upgrades` during trait construction.\n"
