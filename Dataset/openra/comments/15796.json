What does that mean?  I have tested it out on a mod map and it works just as expected... if a unit is in the defined proximity of the actor, then the actor is captured.  I was hoping a time variable could be applied to this so that the capture isn't immediate."

Now I understand that ExternalCapturable functionality is being merged with Capture..\r\n\r\nHow about ProximityCapturable though?  Is that going to be eliminated, or merged in some kind of way?"
