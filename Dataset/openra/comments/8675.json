    "body": "Please lets have at least two PRs finishing our translation support before we run the chrome extraction command:\n1. Adjusting the translation code to support directly translating ids from the chrome logic files, and then extract these IDs into mods.common.\n2. Adjust the server code to send untranslated string ids to the player, and then translate them client side (with strings also extracted to mods.common).\n\nThis chrome string translation is automated, so can be done at any time.  By doing it now, before the translation support is ready, you are just forcing additional overheads on everyone who touches the yaml files and we won't even have proper translations to justify that extra work.\n"
