It could be kept as purely a visual queue like \"oh this unit has survived a lot of combat\" but adding veterancy benefits does effect gameplay and it should be done properly, with proper balancing, testing and thought IF done at all.\n\nSince, as you said, Dune is pretty spammy and quick and all weapons have very effective damage spread so units die rapidly, I think its better not to have it. Having a feature for the sake of it is just messy. I think a cleaner, simpler, purer game is always better (not just to stick to vanilla).\n"

    "body": "theres currently nothing that could stop a moving trike ... no weapon can hit em\nand with this speed , you have almost every map scouted completly in less then 20 seconds\n(which would destroy @penev92 and my efforts convincing @pchote to have \"NoFogOfWar\" or atleast something like Sandstorms recreating shroud instead #9119 )\n\nhaving d2k on default speed isnt ridiculously slow ... it would be close to our RedAlert (our most popular mod)\n\nim not gonna ask for changes ... but i want to clarify that my position here is next to @Unit158 \n\"I want it at the default d2k speed, and this is faster than that :)\" \n\ni think its wrong trying to please old d2k-veterans (never actually met anyone) by having the game on max possible original speed ... even our current d2k-speed is allready ridiculously fast , but that didnt help get any people on board ...   you most likely scare any new players\n"

    "body": "One of the constant criticism towards the Red Alert mod that it **is** slow. A gamespeed change sounds convincing both as an additional point to further depart from the \"RA with sand\" POV and also as a gesture towards \"the game is slooow why you went with this slooow\" haters.\n\nThat being said, the 2x modifier really seems too fast. I am opting for 1.5x.\n"

    "body": "lol , \"constant criticism\" towards RedAlert ... by whom ? cncnet ? \n**what has been a constant criticism towards \"OpenRA\" .. is the lack of a \"GameSpeed-slider\" to control the gamespeed for specific games** for ALL mods\n\nbut beside that , its kind of weird having mods all with their own different gamespeed ... that said ... switching mod and playing a game of RedAlert after playing a D2k-game must feel like youre playing in slow-motion .. \n\n\"Game-Speed\"  shouldnt be a factor to distinguish between our mods ... and RedAlert our \"slowest mod\" is our best horse , theres daily 30-40+ people playing it ... so the lack of speed  doesnt seem to bother anyone\n\nbut hey , if anyone thinks this will help luring \"especially\" new people on D2k , giving it a try ... \nthen i shall not give a shit \n"
