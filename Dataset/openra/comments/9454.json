    "body": "The movement one cell per minute prevents visceroids on maps such as Hour Glass and Lexington from attacking your starting location bases right away. Previously two releases ago they stood still and did not wander at all. But a change happened somewhere where someone added it to make them wander and they wander way to frequently. (Also true that it isnt added in the notes I will add that now)\n\nAs for the Stealth detection the range on Stealth Tanks themselves outranges the mammoth tanks so infantry still have to move closer (Since infantry fire range is 4c0) which means stealth tanks are still rather stealthed. Also, using stealth tanks by themselves is not the best counter as mixing them together with a backing army makes them more deadly. Using stealth tanks alone should not be the all counterable meta. Adding stealth detection to infantry also initiates more infantry play. \n"

    "body": "Myself and Anjew used the playtests before this last release testing light tanks. Worked out rather well. They will be tested on more closely. \n\nAs for range of 2 I thought about doing such but it gives E3 less chance for a response vs stealth tanks. They move rather quickly before they can fire at multiple targets and then they are either crushed or escaped. Also keeping in mind, the E3 missiles will go dead lock when the tanks go stealth. Which means if they leave the 2 cell range the missiles go dead. Makes the E3 ineffective.\n"
