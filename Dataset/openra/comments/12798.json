    "body": "That's an overhaul all right.\r\n\r\nAs to removing popular maps remember this was done to RA as well simply because they were terrible maps and the fact that these were played a lot was a bad thing.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I've complained about a lot on TD the past few years is the map pool and I've made sure to hammer that point across to the TD community whenever I had the chance. It's awful, doesn't really invite to good team games, actually doesn't invite to games whatsoever and as mentioned in the OP hurts TD's image. For many years TD has had some of the best map makers in their community but has failed circulation the official map pool with their contributions.\r\n\r\nI haven't been involved much in TD the past couple of years but these are very old observations and the fact that these are still relevant is a problem for TD. The TD map pool is just _so_ incredibly bad. It has been neglected release after release its literally starting to look like an antique collection. I'm certain the casual offline TD players would appreciate a serious flushing.\r\n\r\nThe TD map pool forum thread recently held off making an impact for the next release: http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=17430\r\n\r\nAnother observation if I may - as for the **80+** TD balance changes with the previous and the upcoming release, a lot of these has been play-tested on custom maps, not official maps, in order to balance the game properly. I think that needs some serious consideration. TD is being modified _with hindsight on custom maps_, the maps the active online community play and not the maps the mod advertises to the casual offline player base.\r\n\r\n>The previous 2 release presented us with 37 balance changes for the TD mod and the current bleed is shipping 52 for the next release. Not saying these changes by themselves are bad but one could see how that might have isolated the competitive core and started putting some real distance between competitive and casual play. TD might need some time to settle before a new healthy rank pyramid grows back into the player base.\r\nquote from: http://www.sleipnirstuff.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=82&p=299934#299934\r\n\r\nThis gap has been growing faster with each release and I don't see the gap closing by carefully add/removing official maps over the course of several releases. There's just no time and from my point of view, TD is running out of time making a future for itself.\r\n\r\nIMO TD needs to take a risk and what better way to do it going hand-in-hand with the recent balance overhauls #12536 #11550 #11758. The potential benefits _far_ outweighs the risks and I'd wager a growing player base one year from now will thank you for it."

This still stands.\r\n* @GraionDilach: Are there any specific maps that you particularly object to removing (\"all of them\" is not going to be helpful).  If you have a good argument for keeping them then @dtluna has already said that he's happy to keep them.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't like the idea of having super-large (more than say 90 - 100) official map pools in any of our mods.
