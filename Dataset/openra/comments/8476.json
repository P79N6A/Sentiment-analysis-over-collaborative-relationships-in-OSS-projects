This is common in TD as well.\n\nTake a look at your destroyer when its hitting its mark. The missile is hitting directly onto the target perfectly. Now take a look when the boats move and they are all shooting. Two of them are off centered from hitting the target which is 'missing' and not striking the target. While only one is hitting the mark each time.\n"
