    "body": "I think @MustaphaTR has a point though about a base that has already been scouted. If you play against France and get a second scout off where you see a CY that has moved a few cells it's almost certainly a fake. Plus some expansions are cramped so placing the fake MCV anywhere except where the original MCV was looks wrong to most experienced players due to the build radius and the suspicious 3x4 gap.\n\nIf it was possible to place a fake CY on-top of a real one (like the TS upgrade modules) and have the real one undeploy into an MCV and move out of the fake CY's cells, that could be one way to solve the issue.\n"
