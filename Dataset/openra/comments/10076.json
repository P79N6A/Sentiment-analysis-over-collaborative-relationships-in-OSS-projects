You know units cannot move on cliffs, so any tiles coloured with the cliff terraintype you know are impassable.\n\nThere could be a key that pops up in this mode, that brings up the name of each terrain type and the associated colour. From there it's not difficult to work out what is passable and what isn't.\n\nAlso, map making should be considered an 'advanced' way for someone to interact with the game. You want to make tools that empower an editor, not a player and although you should make everything understandable you shouldn't limit a feature for the 'normal players' who need no knowledge of the game at all.\n"
