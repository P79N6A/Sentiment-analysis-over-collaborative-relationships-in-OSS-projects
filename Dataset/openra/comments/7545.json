    "body": "I couldn't say what happened there, of course, but our docking-related stuff is really hacky:\n- The harvester-refinery docking is a hack\n- The vehicle-repair pad is basically \"tell the vehicle to walk to these coodinates and repair itself\"\n- I assume the vehicler-rearm facility does the same\n\nI've been wanting to redo those as a follow up of the cleaning I did in #7098 and make docking generic enough to handle (properly) all kinds of docking and use it for the above 3, but I haven't had the time or energy.\nStill, this looks to be a two-part thing. I'm going to guess that:\n1. The helicopters chose rearming locations at the same time, so the check whether that helipad was already reserved was somehow skipped\n2. The hacky way we do rearming (if we do it like the repairing) was unable to stop the helicopters from landing  (and rearming) at the same helipad.\n\nThis is just a guess, but might be a good starting point if someone decides to investigate this.\nIf it is correct, both points will need fixing, as they are different bugs.\n"
