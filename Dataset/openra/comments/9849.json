    "body": "Can't reproduce.  I can imagine this happening though when you place the pillbox directly next to an enemy unit which then manages to escape. The pillbox then won't cloak again until the unit is destroyed. That bug is very likely the same that causes #6185.\n\nAnyway, please describe the circumstances under which this happened in more detail or provide a replay. Thanks!\n"
