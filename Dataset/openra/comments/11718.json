    "body": "I've always faithfully built my concrete in Dune II, but that was also due to the fact repairs on buildings cost insanely more than the concrete under them. Not to mention, structures without concrete decay faster in Dune II.\n\nThough not using concrete probably gives advantages even there. I heard of Dune II players who simply played that way; never repairing anything beyond 50% (since decay only goes down to half), and just resigning themselves to having their buildings being at 50% health. Of course, some simply never bothered with keeping up power either, since in Dune II it didn't impact production yet. Apparently, playing that way wasn't all that more difficult, despite it meaning you have to give up on the detailed minimap.\n\nOf course, that's all single play. I'm not really much of a multiplayer guy. but I know if I'd play Dune II in multiplay I'd probably still build my concrete, so an option forcing that to remove the advantage of people not using it seems like a nice thing.\n"

This way you soft-force concrete but allow skips for special strategies.\nThis would be a suggestion:\n- production: barracks, lt.factory,heavy factory,High-tech-factory, conyard: lower production speed.\n- outpost: make radar flicker in a damage dependent interval.\n- refineries: slower unloading of harvesters.\n- ixlab: ???\n- starport: lower production speed/limit units brought in/increase timer.\n- palace: increase special powers cooldown.\n- repair pad: repair slower.\n\nAlso I think having only 50% health buildings makes you very weak to a flank attack, its a great deal actually.\n"

Bare weapon damage value is 100%, actual damage per armour type is a fraction of that.\n\nAs for the rules... thank Olaf, he originally requested that [my Dune II editor](https://forum.dune2k.com/topic/19114-dune-ii-editor-with-107-support/) be able to dump them. The rule dumps of the other Dune II versions are [in the same folder](http://nyerguds.arsaneus-design.com/dune/dune2rules/) (though I don't think these movement speed values are different in any of them).\n"

    "body": "Hey, I thought about it, and agree the opinions of Ch4Code and Pchote. A concrete option is no sollution to the true problem.  **There need to bee a significant benefit of building concrete besides the aesthetic one.** \n\nThe concrete game mechanic adds alot variation to the build orders. \"easy to learn hard to master\" sounds kinda silly here. But concrete slabs are increasing the complexity of buildorders extremly.\nAnd a hell breaks loose when I place them accidently on the wrong cell. (missclick, canceling all pre orderd stuff) And then there are these shitty d2k structure shapes (refinery and hightech factory). That have that 1 annoying cell on the north side. I rly hate this structure shape and see them as one game design mistakes in d2k... anoying!\n\nOk, now try to view concrete like a techlevel setting. You know, like: playing RA without nukes or with infantry only. Such settings are cool and are adding variation, but they are rarely used. \nA concrete option, is like cutting the techtree from the bottom side. It's a nice to have, that might end up beeing used as rarely as techlevel settings. \n\nBut a \"concrete slab tech\" option would lower the entrance barrier.\nIt would be like: starting with a small base , or a small unit force. Trying to cut away the boring starting game parts. But here again, the default settings used by the most players are \"no extra starting units\". That's not just because its the default. It's due to giving rushes more potential. \nSo, in other words cutting the concrete slab tech would also cut away some game play variance, especially in the early game stages. \n\nConcrete slabs are unique to the dune feeling and should be the default in my opinion. \n\nBut, I totally understand that concrete slabs are super annoying, need extra time & clicks and are odd to the used game flow of other mods. That's why I'd like to suggest an also mostly known middle way.\n\nImagine concrete slabs that spawns automatically some cells arround the constuction yards.\nIf you are running out of the automatically build concrete space, you will have to eighter expand manually, or build another yard. This whole mechanic, could also be a technology that you could be researched at the conyard, like bigger c. slabs.\nIt's close to Zerg creap and also could get used by the AI.\n\nBtw. it's also a feature of \"dune2 the golden path\", that i enjoyed alot.\n"
