    "body": "I set up a Fedora VM and dug around a bit, and as far as I can tell something between SDL, GTK, Wayland, and the GPU drivers is completely broken.  I wasn't able to find much useful information about how to fix this.\r\n\r\n* Your specific problem above happens because `SDL_GetCurrentDisplayMode` reports native pixels but `SDL_CreateWindow` expects scaled points. Creating a window at the \"desktop size\" therefore gives you something twice as big in each dimension.\r\n* We would need to manually divide the native pixels by the scaling ratio (which we don't know) to get a properly sized window, but we can't because `SDL_GetDisplayDPI` doesn't work and `SDL_GL_GetDrawableSize` appears to be returning scaled points instead of native pixels (see below)\r\n* The `SDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI` flag doesn't appear to work, so I guess we need to ping some native API to disable the window scaling and get access to the full resolution OpenGL surface.\r\n\r\nConsidering that (1) you have to explicitly override the SDL backend to trigger this, and (2) window borders and possibly other things break under wayland, i'm leaning towards a WONTFIX for the forseeable future."

    "body": "Ok, well, I think the GTK/Wayland/GPU part seems fine otherwise the entire desktop wouldn't work so well. You are right that the SDL backend is still marked as experimental, so maybe issues are there that cannot be solved within OpenRA just yet. But considering (1), I assume that at some point SDL will auto-select the Wayland backend if it's stable enough and finds Wayland. However, it is safe to say thata Xwayland will stick around for a while, although then I will need the environment variable again and it is only one of two applications that still needs it."
