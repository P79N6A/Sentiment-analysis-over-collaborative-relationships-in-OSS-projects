    "body": "This is expected behaviour then.  The crash windows are provided by the OS specific launchers, and the Windows `openra.exe` launcher is now built only as part of the installer creation.  OpenRA.Game.exe doesn't have any crash dialog logic built in.\r\n\r\nFor dev versions your choices are either to run OpenRA.Game.exe directly and not have the crash dialog, or to use the `launch-game.cmd` scripts from the main repo (default mods) or the mod template (third party mods).  The mod template is currently a bit meh because we need all the mod chooser / package changes merged before we can finish most of its missing features."
