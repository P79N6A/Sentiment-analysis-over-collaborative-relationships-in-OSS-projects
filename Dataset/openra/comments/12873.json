    "body": "Hi @miartad!\r\n\r\nThe backend code looks pretty good to me (there are a couple of minor nits, but they can wait for now), but there are a few things that I think could improve with the UI:\r\n* This is an unreversable action, so really needs a confirmation dialog (see how kicking does it).\r\n* I don't think that having this on its own button is the best approach:\r\n  * Having this on its own button takes up a lot of UI space relative to how often it will be used.\r\n  * It won't scale to the third feature that has also been discussed for quite some time â€“ moving a player to a spectator slot.\r\n  * The iconography should be consistent between mods, and match up with what the feature does.\r\n\r\nI think that a better approach would be to replace the kick `ButtonWidget` with a `DropDownButtonWidget` (see how the slot button does it) that has menu items for kick, make admin, and then in the future make spectator/player.  You'll need to add a new field to `DropDownButtonWidget` that lets you disable the SeparatorImage from yaml."
