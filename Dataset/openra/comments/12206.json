I'm sure that the large number of people who only play vs bots would prefer a more competent AI over one that knows a new trick but uses it to its own disadvantage.\n\nThe next release is too far delayed and we don't seem to have the developer interest to fix these issues properly, so i'm going to insist that we disable AI engineers on the prep branch.  We can fix this properly (together with #11981) and re-enable it for Next + 1.\n"
