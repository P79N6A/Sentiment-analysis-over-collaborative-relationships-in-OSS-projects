    "body": "You must be running windows with a non-integer scaling factor.  You can add `DisableWindowsDPIScaling: true` under the Graphics section in your settings.yaml to restore the old behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis issue demonstrates why it is so important for people to try the playtests, and the consequences when they do not.  The HiDPI enabled builds with this problem have been available since december, and we only recieved a couple of reports of these problems which we believe to be very rare/isolated. If we had known how how widespread they were we would have addressed the problem properly instead of requiring players to manually edit their settings.yaml."
