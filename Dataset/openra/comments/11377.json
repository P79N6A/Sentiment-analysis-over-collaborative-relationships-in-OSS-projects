    "body": "I've been looking forward to this feature for _ages_, nice job Mailaender. Some polish suggestions;\n- Is it possible that once trees catch fire, they continue to burn down to a husk? Trees are very sparse in maps and only a few weapons set them alight, so this polish won't be seen that frequently. It also doesn't make a ton of sense that they self extinguish before they transition to a burnt husk.\n- Can fire animations be transitioned to larger fire animations over time or more fire animations added? I remember the trees in RA1 had a large fire animation covering most of them before they burnt out. Failing that, a larger fire animation would suffice.\n- When a tree transforms into a husk, the husk should continue to burn. Currently when a tree transitions to a husk it is very noticeable since there is only the smoke overlay. The larger fire animation would also help mask this transition.\n- Once set alight, trees should burn for a noticeably long time. Weapons that do set trees alight tend to be very destructive weapons. Trees and tree husks burning for a long time would really emphasize the destructive power of these weapons and add a lot of atmosphere to the aftermath of a skirmish. For comparison, tank husks in RA burn for ~40s and are much more numerous and frequently seen. Perhaps healthy trees should burn for ~2mins and the husks for about ~3mins.\n- The time trees burn for should be randomized. When a nuke hits all the trees self extinguish at the same time.\n- Once the fire extinguishes, the smoke overlay should play for much longer too.\n\nAlso when targeting the trees, they all seem to be offset to the left. I guess this is what @reaperrr was referring to in the first note in #11373?\n"
