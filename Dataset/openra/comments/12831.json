    "body": "@Smittytron: I appreciate your concern but it's misplaced. Its true that the discussion beforehand triggered me to write this PR but the idea of renaming Hind to an Allied Heli is an old idea consistently brought up by new players as far as I can personally remember - which is what, 6 years now?\r\n\r\nMake no mistake I don't start PR's to appease noone and I never have. This PR is what _I_ want. I don't value polls, I definitely don't value adversarial opinion spamming (as done with the linked discussion thread) and I don't often value majority opinions unless its from a group of people I respect and feel confident in that they know what they're doing.\r\n\r\nAs for the change with the .shp unit and icon in relation to originality I can be more sympathetic but in this case I consider this matter to be a non-issue. It's a limited alteration to surgically pick off a long-standing mole on the RA mod's back. I don't worry about the \"slippery-slope\" either - there's no other RA mod related issue that comes anywhere close to the 'rename Hind' issue.\r\n\r\nEgo bruising as a result of one rouge person pushing his or her opinions should be left alone to the forums, not pull the direction of a PR. Allowing that would be just as bad as any appeasement."

    "body": "Here's my counter proposal:\r\nPlace the following text in the [FAQ](https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRA/wiki/FAQ) section under the title, 'The Hind is a Soviet aircraft. Why is it an Allied unit?' ...\r\n\r\n\r\n'In the OpenRA timeline: As Stalin became more aggressive with his plans for Europe, Soviet aerospace engineer Mikhail Mil became disillusioned with the Communist cause and defected to the Allies with the plans for the Hind attack helicopter.\r\n\r\nIn order to balance multiplayer the Hind was transferred to the Allies. The Hind has since become a crucial element of the Allied midgame arsenal, providing scouting and crowd-control vs. infantry.\r\n\r\nWhile yes, we are aware that the Hind is a real-life Soviet-era vehicle, and yes, it would be possible to visually remove the Hind and add an Allied helicopter like the AH-1 Cobra, visually changing the unit would take OpenRA further away from the original Red Alert. \r\n\r\nAs stated in our development goals, OpenRA should retain the feel and nostalgia of the older games. Because a visual change adds nothing to gameplay, and because the Hind is a unit in the original game, we have no plans to remove the Hind from the Allies at this time.'\r\n\r\n\r\nSimply link the FAQ to anyone that brings up the issue again.\r\nI believe zinc mentioned the possibility of a making mission based around the Allies stealing the plans for the Hind. I don't believe it's necessary but if there's an interested party it could compliment my idea."
