I would nerf their health down to 400HP though. \n\nFor shock troopers I think their HP is fair and reducing their range a bit is better than a health nerf.\n\nI think walls should get a health nerf as well since they are super cheap and super strong - itâ€™s way too easy to stop big attacks and block paths completely just by building walls.\n"

Walls are a bit funky in that they're incredible strong yet still underused by the majority of players.

Our RA community has enough people with opinions that there will never be a consensus on even (or especially!) the simplest things.\n\nThe main motivation for designating a few people to collaborate on balance is that you can politely tell people who want to derail balance PRs \"We appreciate your ideas, thanks, but we've already thought about this and are doing it our way for now\" without too many hard feelings.  The bikeshedding should stay on the forums.\n"

    "body": "At minimum I feel like if there were some sort of hard protocol as to how balance changes and tweaks are tested and quality checked _before_ being run through an official playtest then balance PR discussions would be way easier, avoiding talking points that second guess well-founded arguments and weed out emotional input.\n\nIf there was some sort of an established protocol with the above points taken into account then peer reviewing balance PR's could be streamlined but that would require those with merging powers to willingly go in and evaluate the groundwork done by the PR author instead of balance discussions done on a whim with that particular PR. Knowing that the devs generally are soaked in code work it might be considered a drag looking over documentation and overseing the process in general but the development in balance would be tenfolds more efficient and not least, predictable.\n\nI want to emphasize that official playtests aren't really a good platform to reliably test balance changes. There's too little time, too few games with too few committed players to cover 3 mods worth of balance changes. It's a good place for weeding out errors but balance is something that settles over months by a committed player base after implemented with a release - so if we don't have a good pre convieved idea on how balance changes will affect games when the official playtests comes about then naturally the official playtests becomes a huge bottleneck for functional balance tweaks. Instead the changes are leapfrogging from realease after release where minor balance tweaks are overshadowed by broader strokes. This is why units such as the Chrono Tank, MAD Tank, Radar Jammer and every other fringe unit stay exactly the same and don't stand a chance making its way into the game in a meaningful way.\n"

Sourcing relevant opinions (fully excluding anonymous polls) and/or discussions.\n2. Sourcing playtesting and evaluation, all done by a recognized group of players.\n3. All stages sourced must have been open to the public and fully transparent during the process.\n\nContributors could then evaluate certain balance PRs on the quality of the authors' sourced homework, thus forcing discussions topics on to elements not covered directly with the prerequisites. This would also unload a chunk of work upon the PR author and streamline the process in such a way that contributors/developers don't have to spend extra time researching claims presented in the PR.\n\nIn turn this could encourage the community to involve itself more in the development process, especially testing out new ideas and creative solutions knowing that if it proves to add value to the game it has a chance of making its way to a fair evaluation.\n"

One would be to get a panel together over voice or video chat and stream it in a podcast-like setting. Or you could go lower-tech and send mailouts to top-tier and respected players, asking them to write their thoughts on pertinent issues (i.e. Pillboxes). \r\n\r\nA committee should come with a mission statement to use as guild-lines. Beyond balance and state of play I think an obvious guideline some people tend to gloss over when proposing changes would be: â€˜Is it in the spirit of the original game?â€™ In other words, if someone starts playing OpenRA for the first time, will it give them the proper nostalgia kick from when they played it as a kid, or will it feel too foreign?

    "body": "At this point I'm ready to throw away any guideline specific solution and fully endorse a balance team to which balance changes will be filtered through. There's obviously not enough game-play invested developers/contributors to drive forward balance PR's post-1019 and, I guess, after this specific issue was posted. Currently there's only #12470 for the next release and I'm not really looking forward to posting others. I'm starting to feel concerned with the stale nature hereof and I want to underscore the importance of the continued development of game balance in order to support growth both to the player base and the newly acquired competitive scene of RA. And as for the competitive scene the community is starting to experience a bit of overheating due to the game balancing not being able enough to keep up with the growth of skill and the sheer numbers of skilled players.\r\n\r\nOne straightforward way would simply be for the devs to approve of a balance team/person, say 1-3 months after every release, approved through a documentation PR or whatever and simply delegate the power of bringing balance PR's to the table. Unless there's a concern with the balance change in terms of game concept or perhaps lack of groundwork, the devs approve and ship it with the next release."

With the right changes the game will grow regardless. Overall I've always worked on the assumption on that good game balancing is mostly an objective matter and if done correctly, haters, complainers, downers will simply wither away in time, allowing the process to move forward.

(Such as the example of wanting to bring in single engineer captures just with a bit more balance.) Another being putting the Guard Tower to GDI only and Gun Turrets to Nod (Such as CNC95) while balancing it.\r\n\r\nThe other issue is players in RA much prefer base crawling/walking tactics while the others dislike it. The players who enjoy unit on unit clashes often find themselves in TD."

    "body": "My experience so far has been, the more RA is getting pulled towards army compositions, the more satisfied the player-base. There's not really many supporters of base crawling in RA any more. That race pretty much died out after the build radius was added in 12.23.2013.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the core game-play of RA there's not really that much of a divide among the players. The surge of OMnom's playtesting (and now I guess also Fortnight) is a very recent phenomena started within the past 2 months. Some of the new, more radical changes presented with them, I believe, are due to the lack of punch from the community the past 1-2 years and so we're seeing new solutions to the same problems that has been effectively quarantined. The new playtesting threads in the community is a very good sign for the future of the RA mod but will inevitably turn back on itself when realizing that there's no realistic path forward. What they will need is something to measure up against.\r\n\r\nOk then. The problem isn't really about division but rather on giving weight to the opinion of players who know the game inside-out when important decisions are being made. So for the past 2 years there's been gradually growing a consensus on what steps to take in what direction. Effectively the past year, I've done my best to bring aboard the most reasonable balance changes that continually nudge the game in the right direction and, to be frank, have again and again provided better games than the release was ever able to - consistently, and with every round of playtesting since my first batch early last year. That's a pretty bold statement but my track track record would prove that and there never really was ever a divided opinion of it. This is also why the recent experimental builds managed to hold such a big list of changes and still provide reliably good and entertaining games - they've all been progressively added under scrutiny from the community's finest with every batch of playtest maps (with months of analysis between them) all pulling in the same direction. \r\n\r\nIMHO it's long overdue to raise the floor and ship some of the longstanding changes. With exceptions of a few certain names there won't much of a division of the community thereof. The above would be my contribution towards balancing the RA mod for the next release or two. As for the other emerging playtest threads I don't have a strong opinion for or against but in principle I would make the case for my own set of changes _first_ as the most time honored, proven and the most predictable course of change to make the RA mod a better game. There's surely tons of potential with the current play-testers but IMO this is the place to start."

This allowed playtesters to a) save time by not testing different solutions to an issue that was already acted upon and b) test tweeks and ideas against the new reality of 600/800/800 allied static.\r\n\r\nIt also allowed Raishiwi and I to use 600/800/800 (such an important change from the current release) with legitimacy in the KotH tournament. \r\n\r\nLegitimacy is the main point of a competitive committee. While it would add the burden of extra bureaucracy on the process, I believe it could also get changes through with extra focus. I.e. 'This week the competition committee is tackling issue x'. \r\n\r\nAlso I believe some of the ideas out there that are more 'new feature' oriented in nature, (Think 5a's sniper drop, my engi salvage idea, your work on gap generators), could be assigned to different volunteers and presented to the community in a way where they could get more traction than 'eh, that looks cool'."

    "body": "I agree with @pchote on this one. Biggest example I can think of is flame tanks and stealth tanks. Flame tanks used to be really strong with openings where you could decimate bases due to their speed and HP. Going against stealth tanks was tough to detect them. To make it easier on everyone detection was increased and the flame tanks HP and speed were reduced. Also increased their explosion when they die so a pack of them blow up but all still effective units to use.\r\n\r\nThe hard part is balancing the unit out while keeping in mind what a new player does. The only solution I have been able to come up for this is watching streams and see how they play and react in situations. IE: A reason I want single engineer capture is not only to balance and make engineers more useful but new players coming in don't realize its a double capture system and often times are never seen used again. (Still the case in 1v1 TD side)."

    "body": "> Do you mean there are too many players or too few? I'm counting the number of players currently active in competitive 1v1 and I'm not making it very far past ten.\r\n\r\nI was essentially thinking about both the player base in total. Being relatively small, everybody knows everybody. Within this context, in a team structure, relations are more than likely to affect objectivity and with the very short distance between competitive and casual players the friction would be very high. Emotions _always_ run high in these scenarios - not because we underestimate the integrity of ora players but by simply the fact that the community is way too short and cozy. By comparison, if OpenRA was a sizeable corporation there would be infinitely easier to establish a structured balance team setting their own agendas, corresponding with competitive players in subgroups and whatnot.  \r\n\r\nIMO balance decision makers for the RA mod would have to be trusted to make autonomous decisions, to stand alone, avoiding others outside the sphere to take part in the decision making process. Perhaps that sounds counter-intuitive but I don't see another way for it to work reliably. Certainly you wouldn't have to go far to track down the one responsible for good or bad decisions."
