    "body": "This introduced #16192 and apparently another related regression that causes harvesters to end up idle in ore fields (but annoyingly I haven't been able to get any proper reports or replays from the people who claim that this happens).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the `harv.IsFull` case just below this check inserts `DeliverResources` followed by `NextActivity` -- but `DeliverResources` has exactly the same check that was removed here, and so becomes a no-op. Harvesters therefore skip the delivery, run through whatever is queued next, and then either automatically realize they need to unload (e.g. if `FindResources` was the last thing in the queue, or otherwise go idle."
