    "body": "That's correct.  The `Build` function creates squads from all actors contained in a single order. It does this by keeping a count of produced actors and comparing that to the number of ordered ones. When a prerequisite to one of those actors is lost, it obviously cannot reach the expected number and the build consequently stops.\n\nYou could try working around this by using `CancelProduction()` when the radar gets destroyed, although I haven't tried if that would actually work.\n\nThis is unlikely to change (at least in the foreseeable future) since there is no way for the `Build` function to notice that the prerequisite is lost.\n"
