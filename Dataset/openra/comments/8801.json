    "body": "- The \"you can reveal enemy spies with a mouse-over\" issue was brought up a while back and the consensus was to leave it on account of \"if someone is willing to invest the time and effort in discovering spies like that they should be able to.\n- Having more and more of the engine know about spies is just bad. While it may make some sense for `AttackBase` (still not very nice), `Heal` has no business knowing about that, as I said above.\n\nAnd as for your previous question about performace:\nWhile `Heal.InnerTick()` won't be called all that often, `AttackBase.CanTargetActor()` can literally be called thousands of times per second in a team match lategame scenario. Your changes don't do anything to hurt performance significantly though.\n"
