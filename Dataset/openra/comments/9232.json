(As far as I'm understanding from the code that implements the previous behaviour, the AI just seeks out the next nearest ore and would therefore happily beeline into the enemy base if it happened to be closest)\n"

To be fair the harvester resource search also had a check for enemy weapon ranges at that time to prevent it from running into the enemy lines.

(Example: Resource field; Enemy base; Tech structure; Large; Medium; Small; Tiny; etc.)\n\nIf an AI can be made capable of dynamically marking POI for itself, then logic could be added to (during the first few minutes of a game) scan the map and slap down some POI for resource fields.\n\nThen instead of making each individual harvester handle scanning for far-away ore patches, a harvester is only concerned with mining out an immediate area near the position.\n\nOrdering harvesters about between resource fields becomes a task of the AI (similar to how a player also would manage his harvesters). If a harvester is idle (cannot find nearby resources by itself), the AI tries to send it to a POI resource field, taking things into account such as harvesters already there, enemy proximity, field size, distance, etc.\n"
