In RA2 you would see enemy Nuke/Weather Control as well as Chrono and Iron Curtain countdowns for all players, both teammates and enemies.  There was a lot of discussion about how powerful Chrono MCV is..\r\n\r\nI think having the countdown timer visible would help you prepare for the chrono/iron curtain to mitigate how powerful it could potentially be. It is also fun to keep it as a surprise though, so I have no strong feeling on this.. just curious if anyone else has any thoughts.\r\n\r\nDefinitely think at a minimum though we should see our teammates countdowns so that we dont both waste an IC or Chrono or Parabomb etc at the same time."

I definitely think spy plane/paratroops/parabombs should remain hidden, but as you said :-p then you have to wonder why GPS is being exposed?  I understand it's powerful and it was probably done as a balance decision but seems a bit inconsistent..  Also kind of punishes Allies experimenting with quick techs by announcing it to the other player no matter what (even earlier than a SW would).  And IMO the last thing we need is punishing outside-the-box strats & build orders.\r\n\r\nIn any event, while it certainly adds to the surprise factor for the first time, i think in some kind of way having the super weapon timers announced could actually increase the strategic depth by allowing more planned out super weapons strategies.  OpenRA in many ways seems to look to RA2 as a design reference so I am just thinking about how applying RA2's treatment of superweapons timers would play out in OpenRA"
