    "body": ":+1: \n\nTeam games with lots of players could benefit such a feature, especially 1) and 2). The majority of online games seem to be played on big maps with big teams.\n\nFor each openRA game there's almost always new set of colors in play, sometimes obscure, that makes a big team game often a bit harder to follow. I'm sure a lot of players would be grateful to get some type of team-color option in the lobby, or better yet, in-game.\n\nIn Starcraft 2 you can toggle on FoF colors for the minimap which works nicely. A feature for the minimap alone would be very helpful!\n"
