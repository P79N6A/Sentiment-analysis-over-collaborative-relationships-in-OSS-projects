    "body": "OK I implemented keyboard focus management as a stack. When a widget takes focus, it adds itself on top of the stack. When it yields focus, it removes itself from the stack so the one below it becomes the current focus.\n\nThis also allows for automatic focus yielding at widget removal since ForceYieldKeyboardFocus() method is called when a widget is removed. When the map chooser window for example is closed, its focus is removed from the stack and the chat text field of the lobby automatically gets the focus. There is no need to manually yield focus at widget removal or window closure.\n"

When the escape key is pressed, text field resets (becomes empty) and the result list gets updated.\n- Game lobby: When escape key is pressed, chat text field resets. Player name text field resets to unmodified name and keyboard focus is yielded back to chat field.\n- Settings menu Display tab: When escape is pressed, frame limit and player name text fields reset to unmodified value and yield focus. When enter is pressed, leading and trailing white spaces are removed from player name input and the value is checked for zero length. If it is zero, text field resets to unmodified value.\n"

    "body": "I changed the code a bit. ~~Now it also removes null widgets while adding new focus.~~ I added the cleanup method for the following scenario:\nWidget is on focus stack but not the current one. Widget gets removed. ForceYieldKeyboardFocus() is called but since it is not on top of the stack and therefore not the current focus, it is not removed from focus list. After removal, widget becomes null? so now we have a null widget on focus list. When the widgets above it yield focus, at a certain time this null widget will get focus which will hold the focus list, no widget below it would ever get focus because it would never yield focus or get removed, since it's null...\n\nSo the main reason for cleanup is that only the top element on a stack can be removed. But if it was a linked list, I could remove any element and still get the same functionality. Should I change it to that?\n\nAlso now that I think about it, cleanup is only needed when focus is yielded.\n"

    "body": "The idea of having a focus priority assigned for each widget, and using this to decide what widget should be focused when you don't have an explicit assignment is good (and this was what I asked for originally).  Removing the focus tracking, and instead manipulating the widget focus priorities at runtime (and then walking the widget tree for every keyboard event) is not good.\n\nPlease reintroduce `TakeKeyboardFocus`, make it so that the focus priorities remain constant with their default or yaml-assigned values, and then use the focus priorities to assign the default focus when opening a new window or yielding an existing focus.\n"

    "body": "When should `TakeKeyboardFocus()` be called?\n- Mouse click on TextField and HotkeyEntry widget (Currently these are the only places where it is called)\n- When `OpenWindow()` in Widget.cs is called\n- At focus yield\n\nWhat about tabs? It would also need to be called when the active tab is changed. And ingame chat widget would also need it I think...\n\nSo this would make it more complicated than it currently is. And the benefit would be caching the current focus widget and not checking widget tree at every key press. But is this worth it?\n\nCurrently, this code checks the entire `Ui.Root` at every key press. But if a widget is not visible, it is skipped and its children are not checked. And `Ui.Root` only holds one window at a time. When a new window is opened, the current one is removed from `Ui.Root` although it is still in WindowList. So only one window is checked at every key press.\n\nWhich one is better, checking highest priority at each key press and eliminating the use of `TakeKeyboardFocus()` entirely (except for mouse clicks), or adding `TakeKeyboardFocus()` to specific places and checking priority only when needed? The problem with the second option is determining where to add `TakeKeyboardFocus()`.\n"
