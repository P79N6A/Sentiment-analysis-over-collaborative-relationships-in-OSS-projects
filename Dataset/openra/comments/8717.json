With airburst, I've made the missle explode when inside a cylinder of radius `CloseEnough` and height `AirburstAltitude`.

    "body": "> Is this approximately what should happen?\n\n@matija-hustic That's the right direction, but not quite there yet: In TS, airburst missiles would _not_ descent towards the target, instead they'd fly towards and (visually at least, the damage was still dealt to the ground but that's out of this PR's scope) explode at targetpos.Z + AirburstAltitude (original TS used some magic hardcoded number of cells above ground, I think).\n\nThat being said, I digged in my memory and the only Airburst weapon in TS without the Firestorm addon is the voxel cluster missile, so this feature is just a nice-to-have and far from urgent for sprite missiles, at least for now. If you feel like it, you can try to reproduce the behavior described above of course, but maybe it would be better to split Airburst off to its own PR depending on this one, so this PR won't get blocked over any airburst-related issues (I suspect the warheads might need some fiddling as well to reproduce the behavior of the original).\n"

    "body": "@GraionDilach, the current VROT and the current cruise altitude of the rocket infantry actually suffice to guide the missile up the cliff (unless the unit is really close to the cliff, but then maybe something should rather be done with the initial launch angle?) as well as to its bottom.\n\nThe problem is ultimately in the \"in range\" condition. It was triggering too soon (so as to leave enough time and place to accommodate a 180° vertical loop before hitting the target; I've done this intentionally as a provision for the \"worst case\" that could arrive when the missile is guided). I've now changed the trigger to \"only\" accommodate 90° vertical turns (ascent or descent). This wouldn't work well in the mentioned worst case scenario, but will leave enough time for the missile to face and hit its target in most typical cases. Making this condition flexible (i.e. taking into account the exact current vertical facing) would involve a bit more computational complexity (calling an inverse trigonometric function) and would just complicate the code and ideas even more than they already are.\n\n@pchote, I've already considered this before, but thought it might be too computationally expensive. But now I've added a simple look-ahead to the code and I've made the missile target the computed height as soon as possible (when target is out of range).\n"

    "body": "Well I have a new version of the lookahead. When I test it, it avoids almost all obstacles (when physically possible) even without increasing VROT. Plus it tries decelerating to get the vertical turn radius smaller and the missile more easily manoeuvrable.\n\nI might have made it too complex tho... I can push it to this PR so you guys can see if it's something that'd be desired or not\n"
