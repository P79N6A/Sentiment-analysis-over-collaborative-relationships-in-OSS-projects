    "body": "@netnazgul There are multiple levels of selection priority - it's a continuum. The default is `10` and it goes down from there (harvester has `7` for example, MCV has `4`, base buildings have `2`). That's why I added the two new properties to the trait, to explicitly include/exclude actors from selection modes. Otherwise it would have to be an arbitrary less-than-greater-than comparison.\r\n\r\nI have the same concerns regarding the \"special\" mode. Probably it should be restricted to non-combat units (i.e. the ones with priority below `10`).\r\n\r\nI really wanted to do something about aircraft though as it's a pain selecting them over blobs. There are only two mod keys available `Alt` and `Ctrl` and the combination `Alt+Ctrl` which could serve as a third mode. But a third mode would be even more confusing... It's more logical to have `Alt+Ctrl` combine the functions of both. "

It would be OK for me if you could select special units together with other special units (instead of having a priority group for each, like harvesters perhaps should have though). Modders could add their own categories.\r\n\r\nNot a fan of a \"support\" or  \"air\" category: \r\n\r\nI want medics to be selectable with combat infantry. Air units are almost always hotkeyed (mean you could exclude them) but sometimes I want to move a blob and have a heli hover over it, so I want to select the heli, too.\r\n\r\nI don't want to include engineers when I select my army, same goes for harvesters.
