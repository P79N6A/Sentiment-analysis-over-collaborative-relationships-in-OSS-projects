    "body": "The original did name the unit Rocket Launcher despite what everyone called it. It was a good name to call it and even on the tongue it feels faster to say it.\n\nHowever a lot of people say it wrong (Including myself) in saying MLRS because it rolls off the tongue when its actually MRLS. MRLS to me is much harder to say. So naming it the Rocket Launcher is easier to say. Perhaps people will start saying RL :dancing_men:\n\nThe tooltips are very well done and hadn't been in any need of changing in TD except for maybe two. But that depends on what the community would like. (IE: Silos and refineries)\n\nBut hey its a good eye to catch :D\n"

The general C&C community seem to have adopted the name MLRS in favor of MRLS after the Tiberian Sun's _Hover MLRS_ came about. Tib Sun manual: http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/cnc/images/b/be/Manual_Tiberian_Sun.pdf/revision/latest?cb=20120708192212 I\nTheres a good chance the name MLRS was adopted for the reasons you mentioned and it's easier to categorize in memory _MLRS_ with _Hover MLRS_. In light of this I think OpenRA would benefit even more from adopting the name MLRS. Why not move with the current.\n"

And there's no need to deflate the Hind discussion permanently, since this is a valid issue that needs to be fixed. Simply changing the name of the unit is only a half measure. The shp would still be a hind no matter what you call it:p\r\n\r\nAlso a Huey gunship replacing the Hind with a new shp and cameo would be far more appropriate than adding the Cobra which as you have highlighted was replaced by the Apache which is in the game already:P.
