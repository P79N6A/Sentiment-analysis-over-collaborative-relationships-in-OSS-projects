    "body": "@GraionDilach I don't think we should be dismissing the idea entirely, and despite the fact that this may seem overpowered, it's very likely to be a rare case in-game either way. Since when do engineers ever get a cap-off of enemy buildings, especially heavily defended ones like missile silos in the first place? Even then, high-level players would sell their high-tech buildings before they get captured, and it doesn't really matter at all if it's a 1v1.\n\n@pchote, I don't understand why you say \"the idea falls apart,\" as you could've just posed the exception of the multiple tech centers, which @Micr0Bit just addressed/solved. No need to pick apart @kyrylo's innocent suggestion (although the use of \"should\" in his statement is imo a bit much).\n\nAnyways, I think @kyrylo makes a good point here. Allowing these types of engineer abilities would give players a larger incentive to use engineers more strategically, rather than just having them as behind-the-scene units to take your oil derricks for you. In a competitive match though, this proves to be less useful as high-level players are typically more attentive. So...why not? Can't you just let the noobs have fun for once? :P \n- Spy\n"
