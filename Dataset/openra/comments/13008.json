    "body": "@obrakmann : its quite annoying to search for a ping (most likely spammed) that is barely visible on the map,  when the owner of the beacon has a very dark colour.\r\nthis isnt something that was intended , its the implementation of the small sized beacon with no colour-contrast for dark tones and the animation that flashes only one time and then stops \r\n\r\nnot to mention the ping-audio-spam ... when you dont react immediately ... \r\n\r\nand in fact , even when your radars is online ... the radar-vector-animation to locate the ping is hardly helpful ... as it starts out wide-spread and then not even pin-pointing the beacon \r\n\r\nit gets worse when people spam it ... then the animation only repeats itself on the first wide-spread-frame (and no this didnt help preventing people from smashing constantly the beacon button)\r\n\r\nand theres no mute-button specific for the beacon ...
