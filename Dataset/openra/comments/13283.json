    "body": "Maybe not exactly after the Multiplayer title, but yes, I was thinking of exactly this. Maybe we can find a nice place for it where it is immediately seen by ppl joining the MP lobby. I hope this will decrease the chance of ppl leaving - believing that there are no games running/waiting at all and also further decrease the amount of the ]players command in the IRC.\r\nWhat are the general standpoints on this? Would this be helpful?"
