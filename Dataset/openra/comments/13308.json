    "body": "Tracking statistics using player name is a bad idea because player names are completely arbitrary.  Anyone can use anyone elses name, and players might want to change their name without losing their stats.\r\n\r\n#2265 covers the implementation of a player authentication system.  The API and client side code work, but the project is on indefinate hold because we do not have any reliable manpower to build or maintain the web backend."
