    "body": "The AI tries to build it's defenses as close as possible to the last battle encounter IIRC. I agree this looking weird however if the AI ends up constantly attacked/ing from a single direction. The difference between RA2 AI and OpenRA AI is this distinction, RA2 AI lacked a special defense-placement logic.\r\n\r\nThe RA2 AI building placement logic was also weird, in regards of expansions - it couldn't utilize them properly. The AI tried to build a base around the last placed building. If it managed to build up an expansion somehow (via deploying a picked up MCV or Ares-onwards by activating a superweapon which delivered a building far away from the base) it immediately abandoned it's old base.\r\n\r\nThe RA2 ProtectWithWalls AI logic was bugged, sometimes if the AI lost the building desired to be protected, it started to fill the foundation of it with walls. Really amusing when you see squares of walls at an AI base.\r\n\r\nThe AI has emergency backup power capabilities, however the amount of power it stores to do that is a fixed value (and doesn't scale in regards to currently used power). It's IIRC around 60 but won't check it now, higher values end up with the AI starting with a PP-PP-Refi-Barracks build order, which has it's own letdowns (this backup power stashing logic takes priority over all build order plans)."

    "body": "I definitely noticed that (both how weird the RA2 AI behaved and the OpenRA's weird power hunger build order). \r\nI do think there should be some sort of defense build circle for all non-MCV buildings though. One thing I definitely gave RA2 credit for was how it let you build near captured tech buildings (oil, machine shop, service depot, etc). I understand that it's a dated concept that can be easily exploited but, at the very least, allowing defenses to be built within their build range would be nice.\r\n\r\nNow that I've had more time to observe how the AI behaves, I noticed that they do make an extra reserve of power instead of just the bare necessities. But most (all) of the time, their bases can be destroyed by simply flanking them because they don't even make an effort to build where they last (or currently being) attacked. They just keep stacking those line defenses."

    "body": "hmm maybe you guys could exploit what you've done for the super weapon targeting but for building the base?  Not sure how this would work but you could make it so the buildings, terrain type & overlay terrain type, event/attack paths, etc have a certain push and pull to them and settable in the yaml.  Could pull something similar with units that deploy like MCVs and other deployables so when a capture is made the AI would send forces there to reinforce the area until a base could be setup.\r\n\r\nJust ideas but hope it helps with the programmer's block. :) "
