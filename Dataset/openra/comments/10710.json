I thought it was just me but apparently noone can find the map there. \n\nKyrylo made a new revision making it a 2 player map instead of a 4 player map. I'm adding it to the list.\n\nAlso had the pleasure of watching some games on Sudden Death (5 player FFA) and Pool Party (10 Player) by PizzaAtomica. e.g. Pool Party replay w 10 players: http://www.gamereplays.org/openra/replays.php?game=92&show=details&id=310681\n\nBoth are good looking, plays well and supplements the official map pools FFA and 10 player maps. Added those to the list.\n"
