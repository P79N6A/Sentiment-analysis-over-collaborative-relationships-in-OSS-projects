When a THREE.Geometry (or BufferGeometry) is created, no bounding sphere is calculated.\n2. Whenever anyone needs a bounding sphere (raycaster, frustum culling, etc), it invoke computeBoundingSphere on the geometry to get one (said bounding sphere is cached on the geometry).\n3. If there's already a boundingSphere on the geometry, it reuses that and don't recalculate.\n\nTherefore, everytime you update anything that would effect the bounding sphere, you need to explicitly called computeBoundingSphere to update it, just setting the needsUpdate is not enough.\n\nI guess that's due to compute bounding sphere being a fairly intensive calculation, and should generally be called when you really need it to.\n\nSee my example change to you fiddle: http:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/kLnrLypt\/2\/\nI just add the geometry.computeBoundingSphere(); to the end of your onMouseDown, and the raycast work again.\n","created_at":"2016-04-27T15:33:51.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8715#issuecomment-215122592","id":215122592,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8715","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTEyMjU5Mg==","updated_at":"2016-04-27T15:35:45.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/215122592","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SuberFu\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SuberFu\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/4306125?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SuberFu","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SuberFu\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/SuberFu","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SuberFu\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDYxMjU=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SuberFu\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SuberFu\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SuberFu\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"SuberFu","type":"User","id":4306125,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SuberFu\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SuberFu\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@SuberFu yes, my point was just that this is undocumented \/ actually in conflict with the docs, so either it or the docs should be changed, but I wasn't sure which or how.\n","created_at":"2016-04-27T16:08:47.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8715#issuecomment-215133499","id":215133499,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8715","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxNTEzMzQ5OQ==","updated_at":"2016-04-27T16:08:47.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/215133499","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jimmyland\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jimmyland\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1475267?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jimmyland","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jimmyland\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/jimmyland","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jimmyland\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUyNjc=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jimmyland\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jimmyland\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jimmyland\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"jimmyland","type":"User","id":1475267,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jimmyland\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jimmyland\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"Yeah, `boundingSphere` will only be computed in cases when it's needed (raycasting, rendering) and it has not yet been computed.
