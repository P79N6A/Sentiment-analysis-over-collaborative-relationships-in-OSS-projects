I'm glad to make more explanation about this problem.\r\n\r\nas I described in issue #12861, the definition of Tr option in .MTL file is confusing since it actually hasn't never been defined officially. There is a big controversy about it between academic and engineering application. I tried to ask Dr. John Burkardt, which holds the earliest webpage I can find given another different definition, and he didn't give a clear reason and answer about that. Since these two conflicting definition is both widely used in some big projects, (for example, d = Kr = 1 for opaque material is used in 3DS MAX and vcglib, which built meshLab, a good cloud point processing tool project), I give this PR to three.js hoping given a nondiscriminatory treat to them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand. I do totally agree that this change is not supposed to break the back compatibility. I feel very very sorry to bother your work these days. Because that we had some discussion about how to introduce this feature properly and I made reset-and-recommit three times before it was merged. I used the suggestion given by mrdoob in the final version. Unfortunately, because of my carelessness, I didn't re-check the code here and it do make an inverse effect. Yes, @RSpace , you are right, that code treats the Tr option in the inverse way.\r\n\r\nI will open a new PR fixing this soon. \r\n\r\nand I do want to express my apologize of my careless, and I'm truly very very sorry to @mrdoob @WestLangley @RSpace as well as anyone who was confused by my mistake.","created_at":"2018-03-25T18:04:37.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/12862#issuecomment-375990404","id":375990404,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12862","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTk5MDQwNA==","updated_at":"2018-03-25T18:14:14.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/375990404","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/eastpiger\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/eastpiger\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/8267138?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/eastpiger","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/eastpiger\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/eastpiger","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/eastpiger\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjcxMzg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/eastpiger\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/eastpiger\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/eastpiger\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"eastpiger","type":"User","id":8267138,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/eastpiger\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/eastpiger\/orgs"}},{"index":14,"author_association":"NONE","body":"@eastpiger Thanks for the clarification.
