Wonder if the asset's transformations would need to be applied in Blender upon import if that would then export correctly to `three`.\n\nTranslating rigs from one platform\/format to another gets ugly after more than a couple iterations. Even in some of the most advanced pipelines and tools I have ever worked with there was always limits on what a rigged asset could be put through. There may be a solution out there that works for you and everyone but it certainly isn't immediately clear what it is.\n","created_at":"2015-02-12T20:43:26.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6050#issuecomment-74148890","id":74148890,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6050","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MTQ4ODkw","updated_at":"2015-02-12T20:43:26.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/74148890","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1109289?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/repsac","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDkyODk=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"repsac","type":"User","id":1109289,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/orgs"}},{"index":12,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> i didnt wanted to say that my code should get into exporter. \n\nAnd I was more generally referring to something that would attempt to apply axis angles to vertex positions.\n\n``` javascript\nvector = geometry.children[0].geometry.vertices[i];\nvar axis = new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0);\nvar angle = Math.PI \/ 2;\ngeometry.children[0].geometry.vertices[i].applyAxisAngle(axis, angle);

setup a Slack team channel for three.js, mainly to work on animation issues but it can be used for anything three related. This is a private team channel so people can only join by invite. I am looking for:\n- people that know Python\n- people with a solid understanding of rigging in Blender\n- people with animation experiences _and_ scenes willing to share\n\nThis is not an elitist thing. I am limited on time and don't have bandwidth to teach someone Python or Blender, so I apologize if this is does not seem newbie friendly (that's what IRC is for). This is for those who actually want to nip this in the butt and have some useful skillsets to contribute. IRC annoys me and even github threads aren't my favorite place for collaboration.

The action that is selected on the armature that is the parent of the selected mesh...\n2. Attempting to export the other non-selected animations, and failing when attempting to set the animation on the armature, in order to step through the actions keyframes. The result is the the animation from step 1 is exported repeatedly under the different action names... The duration does seem to be correct however amongst the different actions.\n\nI think a recent change in Blender now requires the armature to be the actual selected object in the 3d view in order for action changing to actually take effect.\n\nThis could be solved by changing the exporter to require the armature to be selected for export, instead of the mesh, and the action changing performed int the script may work.\n\nLet me know if you want more help with the blender exporter.. I have a decent background in the scripting for pre 2.6..\n","created_at":"2015-09-18T01:01:43.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6050#issuecomment-141298642","id":141298642,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6050","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTI5ODY0Mg==","updated_at":"2015-09-18T01:01:43.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/141298642","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/350247?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/manthrax","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDI0Nw==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"manthrax","type":"User","id":350247,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/orgs"}},{"index":26,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Another issue, I had to have the right combination of \"rest\" selected both in the script params and on the armature.
