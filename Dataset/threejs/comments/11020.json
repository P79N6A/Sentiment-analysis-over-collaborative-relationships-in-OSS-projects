We had a power outage for a few minutes last night so all my systems got rebooted.  And this morning I cannot reproduce the problem either on master or dev.  So it looks like it may have been some bug in WebStorm (which I use for development) and my \"fix\" was just working around some quirk in WS.  Just as well I retested as there is no point fixing non-bugs, eh? Sorry for any confusion.  Let me know if I am wrong.\r\n\r\nI do have one question, though.  In updating, I got the latest PDBLoader, which now uses BufferGeometry instead of Geometry.  Not sure why this was done.  As you point out in the documentation of BufferGeometry, it makes it hard to access parts of the geometry, etc. which is EXACTLY what rendering a molecule is.  The code to read the (Buffer) Geometry and GeometryBonds is now 10 times as long. Its like the new PDBLoader reads the simple (PDB) text file, then builds these complex BufferGeometry Attributes (instead of constructing the Geometries), then the code which gets the (Buffer) Geometry and GeometryBonds has to go through this fairly complex dance to build the Geometries itself.  Doesn't make sense to me, but perhaps as a noob I am missing something.","created_at":"2017-03-18T17:58:27.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11020#issuecomment-287563148","id":287563148,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11020","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NzU2MzE0OA==","updated_at":"2017-03-18T17:58:27.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/287563148","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rkwright\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rkwright\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/3025864?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rkwright","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rkwright\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/rkwright","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rkwright\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjU4NjQ=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rkwright\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rkwright\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rkwright\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"rkwright","type":"User","id":3025864,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rkwright\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rkwright\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"NONE","body":"@rkwright you're not crazy.
