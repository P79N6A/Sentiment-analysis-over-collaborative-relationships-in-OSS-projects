Basically this would allow ruling out the issue is with the upload of the UV2 data.\r\n\r\n(2) I would then undo that change and then look to force UV2 in the fragment shader to the AO map and avoid any logic with regards to that enabling UV2 -- no defines or anything, because they could be the problem.\r\n\r\n(3) If I can force it I would add back the logic to conditionally define UV2s in the fragment shader and see if they work and which is failing.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: Main Memory -> Vertex Shader -> Fragment Shader.  I would ensure that the data can be fine in each stage.  When I can not get the right data in one stage then I would look at what conditions or modifications to the data that are there and see if I can remove them and if that helps.  Basically it is a search approach.  I think it would take a couple hours to do.\r\n\r\nI've done this before for the Nexus 5 issues and the PBR shader issues.","created_at":"2017-02-22T14:09:34.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10856#issuecomment-281679020","id":281679020,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10856","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTY3OTAyMA==","updated_at":"2017-02-22T14:33:21.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/281679020","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/588541?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/bhouston","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODU0MQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"bhouston","type":"User","id":588541,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/orgs"}},{"index":5,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I finally gave those tests a go this morning.\r\n\r\n* (1) Upload is ok : using uv2 as input of both vUv and vUv2 outputs a correct render.\r\n* (2) Removing every uv2, vUv2, aoMap and lightmap defines had no effect on the result, so I did not go on to (3).\r\n\r\nBut as I was playing with (1) I noticed the following behaviour : \r\n- Using uv as input of vUv and uv2 as input of vUv2 gives a broken render\r\n- Using uv as input of vUv and vUv2 gives a correct render\r\n- Using uv2 as input of vUv and vUv2 gives a correct render\r\n- Using uv2 as input of vUv and uv as input of vUv2 gives a broken render.\r\n\r\nIn other words : using only one attribute for both vUv and vUv2, whether it be uv or uv2, gives a correct render. Using both attributes gives a broken render.\r\n\r\nAdditionnaly I've been noticing that the patterns of the \"broken\" sampling are the same. @WestLangley deleted his post but earlier asked for a screenshot of a render of the material applied to a plane, I began to think that time had come to try it. It appears the second attribute, whether it is uv or uv2, that is used for sampling, is... shifted to the left, its first value 'x' is slightly increased.
