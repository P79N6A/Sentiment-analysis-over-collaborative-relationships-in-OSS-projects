I have been seeing that most developers using `THREE.DeviceOrientationControls` are not  providing good (or, frankly, any) fallback controls in the case that DeviceOrientation Events are not supported on the user's device\/browser.

You need to add a listener to it and add the controls if the value isn't null. This makes things trickier than they should be...\n\nI agree. It is extremely difficult since the event may be available but may just return null. In other implementations, the first events fired always return null while the sensors are 'warmed up'. That makes it difficult to detect this stuff reliably right now without using e.g. a setTimeout function to check no subsequent events are fired that do provide full event data.\n\nI've requested some changes to the W3C DeviceOrientation Events API specification (https:\/\/github.com\/w3c\/deviceorientation\/pull\/12) so we have a way to reliably detect whether device orientation is supported by the current UA or not.
