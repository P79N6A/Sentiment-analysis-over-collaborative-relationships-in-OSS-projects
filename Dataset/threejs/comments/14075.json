Current thoughts though:\r\n\r\n- processImage(map) should be processImage(image, mimeType, flipY)?\r\nAllowing access to map\/texture-centric properties after the cache checks will be dangerous now. I think it makes sense to change this so we restrict it. It also makes the function a bit more predictable too (processImage processes images instead of textures). \r\n- Maybe there's a way to generate a map key from these params, so we can have a more direct lookup (as an alternative to pulling an array of different configs).\r\n\r\nI'll have a muck around anyway and get back to you guys when I have something useful :-)","created_at":"2018-05-17T11:57:54.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/14075#issuecomment-389841519","id":389841519,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14075","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTg0MTUxOQ==","updated_at":"2018-05-17T11:57:54.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/389841519","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kickblade\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kickblade\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/39281961?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kickblade","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kickblade\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/kickblade","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kickblade\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjgxOTYx","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kickblade\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kickblade\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kickblade\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"kickblade","type":"User","id":39281961,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kickblade\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kickblade\/orgs"}},{"index":12,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I couldn't think of a way to obtain a key from `texture.image` without modifying the element itself (`image.src` is not necessarily safe; it could be a `<canvas\/>`).

I did come across a couple of forums discussing ES7 value-type implementation for Map() mentioned here: https:\/\/esdiscuss.org\/topic\/value-types-as-map-keys-in-es7 but I've searched all over the place and can't find very much else on it.\r\n\r\nSo I think for this upcoming milestone, it comes down to a choice between one of your two Map() ideas or an alternative Array implementation:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncachedData.images = []\r\n...\r\nfunction processImage( image, mimeType, flipY ) {\r\n\tvar result = cachedData.images.find( function( entry ) {\r\n\t\treturn \tentry.img === image &&\r\n\t\t\t\tentry.mimeType === mimeType &&\r\n\t\t\t\tentry.flipY === flipY;\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n\tif( result != undefined ) {\r\n\t\treturn result.index;\r\n\t}\r\n...\r\n\tvar entry = {\r\n\t\timg: image,\r\n\t\tmimeType: mimeType,\r\n\t\tflipY: flipY,\r\n\t\tindex: outputJSON.images.length - 1\r\n\t}\r\n\tcachedData.images.push( entry );\r\n\treturn entry.index;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nO(n) worst case for the array versus ~O(log n) worst case for the maps.
