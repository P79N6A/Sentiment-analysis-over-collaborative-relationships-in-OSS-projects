I think we are all on the same page, then.\r\n\r\n@mrdoob Given that the glTF developers seem determined to make this change, I think three.js would be wise to adopt the glTF convention regarding lights. Currently, this only affects `RectAreaLight`, because for now, it is the only three.js light whose orientation is defined by its quaternion.\r\n\r\nI will file a PR to modify the convention for `RectAreaLight` if you agree to the change. The change should largely be transparent to the users as long as they use `lookAt()` to orient the light, instead of setting the quaternion directly.","created_at":"2018-09-15T02:45:39.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/14775#issuecomment-421525219","id":421525219,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14775","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTUyNTIxOQ==","updated_at":"2018-09-15T02:45:39.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/421525219","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1000017?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/WestLangley","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDAwMTc=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"WestLangley","type":"User","id":1000017,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/orgs"}},{"index":13,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Note there will be no area lights in glTF for now - only punctual (point\/spot\/directional).","created_at":"2018-09-15T03:51:27.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/14775#issuecomment-421528259","id":421528259,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14775","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTUyODI1OQ==","updated_at":"2018-09-15T03:51:27.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/421528259","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}},{"index":14,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"Thanks!","created_at":"2018-09-25T18:31:14.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/14775#issuecomment-424452589","id":424452589,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14775","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNDQ1MjU4OQ==","updated_at":"2018-09-25T18:31:14.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/424452589","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/97088?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDg4","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"mrdoob","type":"User","id":97088,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/orgs"}}]}
