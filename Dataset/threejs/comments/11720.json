It seems this isn't an issue with the exporter then, but an issue with my understanding of the way BufferGeometry handles normals. \r\n\r\nSo just to clarify, BufferGeometry stores vertex normals, but Geometry can have either vertex or face normals? I was reading the [BuferGeometry documentation page](https:\/\/threejs.org\/docs\/index.html#api\/core\/BufferGeometry) and it states:\r\n\r\n> normal (itemSize: 3)\r\n> Stores the x, y, and z components of the face or vertex normal vector of each vertex in this geometry. Set by .fromGeometry(). \r\n\r\n... which was a bit confusing, because it says it stores \"face or vertex normal vector\".","created_at":"2017-07-10T18:44:33.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11720#issuecomment-314198293","id":314198293,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11720","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDE5ODI5Mw==","updated_at":"2017-07-10T18:46:48.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/314198293","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/marquizzo\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/marquizzo\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/7864858?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/marquizzo","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/marquizzo\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/marquizzo","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/marquizzo\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NjQ4NTg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/marquizzo\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/marquizzo\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/marquizzo\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"marquizzo","type":"User","id":7864858,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/marquizzo\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/marquizzo\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"`Geometry` can have vertex normals and\/or face normals.
