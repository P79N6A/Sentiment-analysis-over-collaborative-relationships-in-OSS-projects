If the failure is timeout based what is the maximum particle count possible may depend on performance of the user's CPU, so maybe hard limits aren't correct for all users. A warning might be better in that case.\r\n\r\nIt clearly shows deficiencies in the MS shader compiler\/converter. Is it worth filing a bug against Edge?\r\n\r\nIncidentally removing one of the texture2D() accesses from the nested loops allowed the code to compile with higher particle counts (although obviously breaking the code), Which indicates it is not just the loop count, but also dependant on the complexity of the code within the loop.","created_at":"2017-04-28T08:56:18.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/11251#issuecomment-297945676","id":297945676,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11251","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5Nzk0NTY3Ng==","updated_at":"2017-04-28T08:56:18.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/297945676","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aardgoose\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aardgoose\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/17364910?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aardgoose","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aardgoose\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/aardgoose","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aardgoose\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzY0OTEw","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aardgoose\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aardgoose\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aardgoose\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"aardgoose","type":"User","id":17364910,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aardgoose\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/aardgoose\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Probably this should be raised as a bug with Edge \/ I.E. as well.","created_at":"2017-04-28T16:22:47.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/11251#issuecomment-298042937","id":298042937,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11251","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODA0MjkzNw==","updated_at":"2017-04-28T16:24:25.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/298042937","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/5307958?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/looeee","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDc5NTg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"looeee","type":"User","id":5307958,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I've logged this with MS Issue #11827163.
