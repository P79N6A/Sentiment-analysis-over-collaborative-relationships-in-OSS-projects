This kind of makes sense because an armature is not a mesh. I believe we exported a rigged object by removing the armature in the \"modifier\" tab and exporting the mesh and the armature by selecting them both and exporting them (or as @Jeremboo mentioned, not select anything). Of course select the Geometry you need in the exporter.  \r\n\r\nMy problem was exporting a spline from Blender to JSON. This gave the same error because, well, a spline is not a mesh. Some python magic did the trick. I'm not a developer myself so I cant explain how kit was done. But with a little bit of Python knowledge, this shouldn't be to hard.
