IMO, your issue is some kind of degenerated case. You can't expect of a polygon triangulation algorithm to handle all kinds of parametrization. I guess it makes more sense to clean up your data in some sort of pre-processing step.","created_at":"2018-01-23T10:12:55.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/13160#issuecomment-359743151","id":359743151,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/13160","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1OTc0MzE1MQ==","updated_at":"2018-01-23T10:42:04.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/359743151","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/12612165?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mugen87","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Mugen87","type":"User","id":12612165,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/orgs"}}]}
