It might be the case that supporting these models is more useful than supporting models with reused geometry. But certainly more testing is in order before making that decision - and ideally a solution that suits both cases can be found.","created_at":"2017-08-09T05:14:04.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11895#issuecomment-321154716","id":321154716,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11895","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTE1NDcxNg==","updated_at":"2017-08-09T05:14:04.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/321154716","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/5307958?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/looeee","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDc5NTg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"looeee","type":"User","id":5307958,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/orgs"}},{"index":10,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"Hmm...
