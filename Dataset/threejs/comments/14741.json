Especially since image upload tends to drop frames badly (more browsers need ImageBitmap support! \ud83d\ude05) I'm not sure we'd want to roll out a second load callback just for pre-texture-load across all loaders. Just making `.load()` work in a consistent way will be a big task on its own.\r\n\r\nWe could do something more explicit and flexible like a streaming option:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew FooLoader()\r\n  .setStreaming( true )\r\n  .load( 'model.foo', ( o ) => { ... } );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gives the flexibility to do incremental display in other ways, like loading lower LODs first. But I imagine only a few loaders would actually support that. glTF has some features intended to help with streaming, but even there we don't have an established best practice or examples yet. I think SEA3D does have streaming, too?","created_at":"2018-08-22T14:52:28.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/14741#issuecomment-415060386","id":415060386,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14741","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTA2MDM4Ng==","updated_at":"2018-08-22T14:52:28.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/415060386","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}},{"index":12,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> Especially since image upload tends to drop frames badly\r\n\r\nThree.js is general purpose 3D CG library for web, not only for WebVR.

Short response time is sometimes very important for web contents.\r\n\r\nIndeed I was one of them. I made an app(non-VR) which just renders models with large and many textures. I wanted to start rendering the models as soon as possible even without textures not to lose visitors interest.\r\n\r\nAbout `.setStreaming()`, is your idea that Loaders fire `onLoad` callback when all assets are ready if `.streaming = false (default)` but if `.streaming = true` Loaders fire before all assets are ready (maybe the behavior depends on Loader like low-level LOD first or non-texture)?\r\n\r\nIf so, it'd be good. What I wanted to suggest is providing a something way for short response time contents rather than having two onload callback.","created_at":"2018-08-22T15:51:02.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/14741#issuecomment-415081784","id":415081784,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14741","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTA4MTc4NA==","updated_at":"2018-08-22T15:55:55.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/415081784","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/7637832?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/takahirox","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2Mzc4MzI=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"takahirox","type":"User","id":7637832,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/orgs"}},{"index":13,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"On further consideration I'm inclined to side with @takahirox on this. We should not take away the ability for users to decide to display models before textures are loaded if they want, especially since we currently (if awkwardly) allow both behaviours via loader's `onLoad` vs `loadingManager.onLoad`.
