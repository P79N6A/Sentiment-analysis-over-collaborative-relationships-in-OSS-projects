Thanks for the good work. \r\nFor future reference, anyone using Typescript and seeing buffers overrun or hit unknown parts at random: Make sure you're not importing Three.js twice via includes or require. Never import * as THREE. Just reference path it. Two copies of Three.js running simultaneously will attempt to read\/write the same buffer attributes and hit something undefined anytime they're accessed from a subsequent include. The only way to properly use in Typescript is to not import Three.js at all, just put it in a script tag in your HTML and use a reference path to the definition file. Don't import 'three' from various parts of your project. It tends to load more than one copy and they all write to the same canvas and try to access the same buffers.\r\n\r\nHopefully this saves someone some time.","created_at":"2018-09-05T11:23:35.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14848#issuecomment-418695665","id":418695665,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14848","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODY5NTY2NQ==","updated_at":"2018-09-05T11:30:30.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/418695665","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joshstrike\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joshstrike\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1175850?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joshstrike","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joshstrike\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/joshstrike","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joshstrike\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzU4NTA=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joshstrike\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joshstrike\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joshstrike\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"joshstrike","type":"User","id":1175850,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joshstrike\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joshstrike\/orgs"}}]}
