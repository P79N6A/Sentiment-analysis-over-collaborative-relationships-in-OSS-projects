If the geometry is never used as a mesh, but only for creating a `THREE.Line` then a single line starting at the center of the circle is drawn.\n\n---\n\nOn the right I drew a custom sphere `Geometry`. It is defined with minimal amount of points in counterclockwise order starting on the right. I also added the faces so the mesh (rendered at top right) looks exactly the same as the mesh made from the `SphereGeometry`. With `THREE.Line` this geometry simply draws the outline of the circle.
