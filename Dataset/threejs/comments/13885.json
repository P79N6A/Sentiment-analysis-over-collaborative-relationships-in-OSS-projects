Let me try to give a more intuitive thought about what this kind of information is useful for.\r\n\r\nWhen a robot is in a certain configuration\/pose, you might \u2014 for whatever motives you may have \u2014 want to visualize the robot's ability to move with a certain velocity in a specific direction. This is the so-called *velocity ellipsoid* \u2014 cf. Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n`Figure 1: Velocity ellipsoid of the ABB IRB 120-3\/0.6 at the shown configuration.`\r\n![Velocity ellipsoid](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/FZkeFpl.png)\r\n\r\nThe next thing you might want to visualize (and this is what I am working on right now) is the ability of the robot to *accelerate* in a certain direction. This is given by the so-called acceleration ellipsoid, which requires the *inertial matrix* of the robot to be known.\r\n\r\nI hope this was clearer... :wink: ","created_at":"2018-04-17T19:05:59.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/13885#issuecomment-382106620","id":382106620,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/13885","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MjEwNjYyMA==","updated_at":"2018-04-17T19:08:08.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/382106620","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ferrolho\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ferrolho\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/4166093?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ferrolho","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ferrolho\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/ferrolho","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ferrolho\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNjYwOTM=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ferrolho\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ferrolho\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ferrolho\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"ferrolho","type":"User","id":4166093,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ferrolho\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ferrolho\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"OMG, the scope of Collada is really astonishing...","created_at":"2018-04-17T19:27:49.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/13885#issuecomment-382112905","id":382112905,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/13885","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MjExMjkwNQ==","updated_at":"2018-04-17T19:27:49.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/382112905","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/12612165?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mugen87","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Mugen87","type":"User","id":12612165,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It certainly is!
