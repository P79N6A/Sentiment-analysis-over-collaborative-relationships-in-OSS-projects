Either a byte offset problem or endianness usually, or non-float data being interpreted as floats.\r\n\r\nSo I wanted to compare what we were reading to what was in the file. Grabbed the first vert as output by plyloader -- it was borked, which was suspicious, as by the truncation hypothesis from earlier it should have been fine. Also grabbed the header length to know where to look: 256. Then I did a hex dump to see what the bytes at the beginning of the file looked like:\r\n\r\n    000000f0  63 65 73 0d 0a 65 6e 64  5f 68 65 61 64 65 72 0d  |ces..end_header.|\r\n    00000100  0a 48 0d cc bd e3 9c 05  be 7f 08 eb 3e 76 6d 64  |.H..........>vmd|\r\n\r\nI was looking at `0a 48 0d cc`, which we were reading as the first float. But byte 256, the purported end of the header, is `0d`, not the `\\n` (`0a`) I was expecting. \r\n\r\nTurns out we had used `end_header\\s` in our regex to parse the header, which worked fine when the file was written with unix line endings. The parsing of the interior of the header (as well as the ascii parser) was splitting into lines, so javascript was taking care of the line endings for us. But here, dos line endings meant we had two characters and that regex couldn't eat them.
