All `ExtrudeGeometry` needs to know is whether the \"inside\" of a polygon lies to the left or right of a polygon chain ( #4590 ). The next version of PnlTri.js will provide this information.\nSo it looks like the whole mechanism of splitting a path into separate shapes and deciding which subpaths are contours and with are holes and which holes belong to which contour could be thrown away if a shape can take any number of polygon chains. I guess this would make the classes simpler and refactoring easier.\n","created_at":"2014-06-22T08:51:53.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/4745#issuecomment-46775729","id":46775729,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/4745","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2Nzc1NzI5","updated_at":"2014-06-22T08:51:53.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/46775729","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jahting\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jahting\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/6388056?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jahting","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jahting\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/jahting","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jahting\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzODgwNTY=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jahting\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jahting\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jahting\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"jahting","type":"User","id":6388056,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jahting\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jahting\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"I'm all for simplifying\/refactoring code ^^\n","created_at":"2014-06-22T23:54:07.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/4745#issuecomment-46796768","id":46796768,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/4745","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2Nzk2NzY4","updated_at":"2014-06-22T23:54:07.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/46796768","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/97088?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDg4","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"mrdoob","type":"User","id":97088,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"The `Curve`\/`Shape` classes were refactored and enhanced in the past (e.g. #12406 or #12797).
