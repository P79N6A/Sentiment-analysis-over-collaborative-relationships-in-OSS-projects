The mislabeled \"bug\" with the animations is actually a result of editing the logic to utilize `pose.bone` data. This was included in the r67 release and tho it did solve issues for some users it actually broke animations for others (based on how their scenes were setup). I had released the new exporter with the pre-`pose.bone` data which would have been good news for the some pre-r67 users but was bad news for others.\n\nEither way this issue would have come up eventually but the context would have been treated as just another bug if we were still on the old exporter, instead it was discovered in my exporter making it look like the source of the problem lay there and therefore drawing harsher criticism from users who weren't in favor of such a large change to the exporter's code base. \n","created_at":"2015-02-04T07:06:10.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6020#issuecomment-72800924","id":72800924,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6020","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyODAwOTI0","updated_at":"2015-02-04T07:06:10.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/72800924","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1109289?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/repsac","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDkyODk=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"repsac","type":"User","id":1109289,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I appreciate the work you're doing with the new exporter @repsac.
