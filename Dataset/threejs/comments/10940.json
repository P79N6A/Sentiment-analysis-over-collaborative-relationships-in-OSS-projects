RGBM mostly interpolates correctly in its encoded form -- not perfectly but well enough that usually you do not notice the issue.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for perfect results with full gumat, decode to FP16 or FP32 and use that as the texture.  The decoded true HDR values will of course interpolate properly but this does require a few extensions to be present.\r\n\r\nIf you check out how I implemented encoding you can actually decode a source RGBE Texture and re-encode as RGBM RenderTarget.
