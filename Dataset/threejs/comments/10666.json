I didn't find it in the docs, searching for Buffer (nice docs search feature, btw) I found:\r\n```\r\nBufferAttribute\r\nBufferGeometry\r\nInstancedBufferAttribute\r\nInstancedBufferGeometry\r\nInstancedInterleavedBuffer\r\nInterleavedBuffer\r\nInterleavedBufferAttribute\r\n```\r\nNot one of these, right? Or Instanced === Indexed? I'm presuming Instanced refers to http:\/\/blog.tojicode.com\/2013\/07\/webgl-instancing-with.html\r\n\r\nSo maybe this.setIndex( indices ) in BufferGeometry is the difference? That would be superb.

An example is InstancedBufferGeometry or InstancedBufferAttribute\r\n* Have some *really* dead simple examples of the more advanced features.
