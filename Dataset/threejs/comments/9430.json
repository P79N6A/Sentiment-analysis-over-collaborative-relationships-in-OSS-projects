I've moved utils maths stuff out into static method and the non WebVR 1 fullscreen management also into an external \"polyfill\" utils function. \n\nYou can't fallback to fullscreen canvas for WebVR 1 as far as I can understand. The api changed ? The events are there to determine what to do next as far as UI is concerned. \n\nIt should be easier to read what it is doing now. \n\nI haven't completed with a readme and moving over the original header comments where required into the maths utils part. \n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/danrossi\/three-vreffect\n","created_at":"2016-08-22T19:32:56.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/9430#issuecomment-241523940","id":241523940,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/9430","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MTUyMzk0MA==","updated_at":"2016-08-22T19:32:56.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/241523940","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/710277?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/danrossi","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI3Nw==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"danrossi","type":"User","id":710277,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/orgs"}},{"index":11,"author_association":"NONE","body":"There is still no presenting support in webvr in Chrome on Android, no native distortion either. \n\nIt would be nice to have CardboardEffect added back in as a fallback for now until WebVR is enabled by default.

It would be easier if it was a function part of the examples at least that can be imported directly. \n\nI will try to import the distorter somehow directly into my Es6 project but it might be hard to implement and it uses raw functions. I can see what it's trying to do with the vertex distortion in a shader program although uses device specific data. \n\nThe mesh distortion is working again for now as stereo, it was only displaying on the left. \n\nI've reverted back to the VrEffect at is keeps getting refactors. But do display checks duplicated outside of it so I can dispatch when displays are available and it can present. You have no idea when it has obtained displays, as in no events that is all. \n\nI guess we should close this and Android might have native distortion working when WebVr is enabled by default. \n","created_at":"2016-10-18T08:42:59.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/9430#issuecomment-254444503","id":254444503,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/9430","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDQ0NDUwMw==","updated_at":"2016-10-18T08:42:59.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/254444503","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/710277?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/danrossi","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDI3Nw==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"danrossi","type":"User","id":710277,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danrossi\/orgs"}},{"index":14,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm seeing the same issue with `displayName : ARCore VR Device` on a Google Pixel with DayDream.
