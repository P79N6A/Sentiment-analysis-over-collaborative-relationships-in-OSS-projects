I found info that probably i need copy paste GLTFLoader file but still it's not obvious. Also usage of loaders in different loaders examples looks quite different (i assume it's not because on loader speciefic) what makes harder to find out how to actually use them. I think we need one simple, complete example how to just move our 3D model on browser screen :)","created_at":"2018-10-23T21:02:15.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/15116#issuecomment-432418369","id":432418369,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/15116","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMjQxODM2OQ==","updated_at":"2018-10-23T21:02:15.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/432418369","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Alwox\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Alwox\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/5628945?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Alwox","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Alwox\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Alwox","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Alwox\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2Mjg5NDU=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Alwox\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Alwox\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Alwox\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Alwox","type":"User","id":5628945,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Alwox\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Alwox\/orgs"}}]}
