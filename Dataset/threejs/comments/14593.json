If you want to suggest a (strawman) extension name like FRAUNHOFER_object_space_normal_map we can add that to the model and prevent it from being loaded incorrectly elsewhere by accident.\r\n\r\nRight now we are only using this in our HTML5 export, which is a BabylonJS viewer and a glTF file.\r\nWhat we do there is add a flag to \"extras\" and interpret it in the JS code of the viewer to tell Babylon how to interpret the normal map:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(...)\r\n\"materials\": [\r\n  {\r\n      \"normalTexture\": {\r\n        \"extras\": {\r\n          \"objectSpaceNormals\": true\r\n        },\r\n        \"index\": 0\r\n      },\r\n     (...)\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is kind of hack is supposed to only be used within our HTML export, so we didn't add an extension yet.
