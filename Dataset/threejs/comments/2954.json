What limitations does it have?\n\nWell, _limitations_ might have been a strong word. A year ago when I looked at the ColladaLoader it did not handle properly materials with multiple textures and some animated meshes. When looking at the code and trying to fix that I had the impression that it did not properly handle the collada address syntax. Although when I look at the code now, I don't remember what parts I thought would be wrong. Also, I had trouble understanding the code and adding new features. So I thought that rewriting the whole loader would be easier than trying to fix it (what a mistake...).\n\nIf you are not interested in the new loader, I can also try to collect a list of bugs that the old loader has. I have a set of animated meshes that do not work, but they are proprietary - if you want to use them for testing, send me a [private message](mailto:robin@dbservice.com).\n\n> It would be best to not introduce coffee script into Three.js\n\nI know this is a problem and am not sure how to solve it. For the type of code used in the loader, the [coffeescript version](http:\/\/n.ethz.ch\/~crobi\/threejs-collada\/ColladaLoader2.coffee) is just so much nicer than the [javascript version](http:\/\/n.ethz.ch\/~crobi\/threejs-collada\/ColladaLoader2.js) that I do not want to abandon it. And contributing to both versions would not work.\nHowever, if there is interest in my loader, I could provide a clean javascript version where I and other people could contribute to. \n","created_at":"2013-01-21T13:06:07.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/2954#issuecomment-12496946","id":12496946,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/2954","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNDk2OTQ2","updated_at":"2013-01-21T13:06:07.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/12496946","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/577871?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/crobi","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3MQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"crobi","type":"User","id":577871,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@crobi, for shared projects that you want a lot of users of it is always best to use the lowest common denominator technology as it provides the most flexibility.  This is why Linux and Windows NT core is generally C even though C++ existed when they were first created.  Generally Linus doesn't accept C++ code in the core of Linux even if it is nicely written, it just doesn't happen.  Cutting edge technologies are great for end user applications but putting them into core libraries, especially when previously they were not used in the core libraries, is generally a really hard sell.  Three.js is all around very conservative on the JavaScript techniques it deploys and this in part makes it very accessible and also everyone had a good understanding of its performance characteristics.\n\nI am all for a better Collada loader but putting it into Coffeescript is really challenging for an otherwise non-Coffeescript library.\n\nYou would have to change the style a bit in the JavaScript version, but the benefit would be that there would be a mass of people contributing to it, such as myself, rather than just having to maintain it more on your own or with a smaller group of people.\n","created_at":"2013-01-21T13:15:51.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/2954#issuecomment-12497272","id":12497272,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/2954","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNDk3Mjcy","updated_at":"2013-01-21T13:15:51.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/12497272","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/588541?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/bhouston","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODU0MQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"bhouston","type":"User","id":588541,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@crobi, there is only 6kb difference (~5%) between the coffeescript and javascript versions, that isn't that much of a savings in terms of keystrokes.

My advice is - don't use COLLADA loaders, look for another exchange format or write your own special parser like i did.\nWorking example: http:\/\/bp.lukyer.cz (sorry for low server resources, try small models, parser is expensive to run on this cheap server, localhost is OK)\nLink to thesis: https:\/\/wis.fit.vutbr.cz\/FIT\/st\/rp.php\/rp\/2012\/BP\/15557.pdf . Sorry for Czech language, but i'm willing to try to translate parts someone could be interested in. Feel free to write me if you're interested in.\nRegards,\nLuk\u00e1\u0161 Sva\u010dina.\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n","created_at":"2014-07-11T16:32:55.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/2954#issuecomment-48752752","id":48752752,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/2954","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NzUyNzUy","updated_at":"2014-07-11T16:32:55.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/48752752","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/reddozen\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/reddozen\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/3182128?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/reddozen","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/reddozen\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/reddozen","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/reddozen\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIxMjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/reddozen\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/reddozen\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/reddozen\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"reddozen","type":"User","id":3182128,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/reddozen\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/reddozen\/orgs"}}]}
