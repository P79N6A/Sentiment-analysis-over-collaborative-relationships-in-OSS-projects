So you are given a scene and an animation expressed in one basis, and you want to convert the scene and animation to another basis -- the three.js basis.\r\n\r\nIf it is convenient to assume that conversion is a pure rotation plus, perhaps, a reflection -- and if it simplifies the math -- that is fine, but that assumption is not necessary.

The current used matrix ensures that the handedness stays untouched. So it converts a right-handed Z-UP to right-handed Y-UP. To be precise, the matrix swaps `z` and `y` of a vector and then inverts the sign of `z`. This transform can be applied to single vectors or to matrices (via `convertMatrix4`). \r\n\r\n> This is just a change of basis, right?\r\n\r\n`convertMatrix4` changes not only the basis vectors but also the translation part of a 4x4 matrix. I'm not sure about the correct terminology, but i think the conversion is therefore not limited on the basis. \r\n\r\n> I see you are making assumptions when you transform the vertex normals and do not use a normal matrix for that purpose.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of assumptions do i make here? Do you mean i assume that the translation part of a conversion matrix is always zero? \r\n\r\nBut yeah, using a 3x3 normal matrix (without translation) is of course more correct.\r\n\r\n>  I do not understand the necessity for calling decompose().\r\n\r\nI thought this is necessary so `.position`, `.quaternion` and `.scale` are correct after the conversion. When the model matrix changes, they need an update in order to reflect the new values.\r\n\r\nBTW: Thanks for your feedback so far! \ud83d\ude0a ","created_at":"2017-06-18T09:48:47.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/11540#issuecomment-309267283","id":309267283,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11540","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTI2NzI4Mw==","updated_at":"2017-06-18T13:32:54.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/309267283","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/12612165?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mugen87","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Mugen87","type":"User","id":12612165,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":">  Maybe adding comments explaining each step would be helpful.\r\n\r\nI'll improve this.","created_at":"2017-06-18T09:53:31.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/11540#issuecomment-309267472","id":309267472,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11540","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTI2NzQ3Mg==","updated_at":"2017-06-18T09:53:31.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/309267472","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/12612165?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mugen87","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Mugen87","type":"User","id":12612165,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I'd like to move forward with this PR because i need this logic in `ColladaLoader2`.
