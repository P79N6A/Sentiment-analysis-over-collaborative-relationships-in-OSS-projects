If you like, you can imagine the bone's \"tail\" to be somewhere offseted along the z-axis of the head's matrix. Usually 3D programs displays bones with head and tail, as it feels more natural and intuitive to work with, but really it's just a way to rotate the head. \n\nAt THREE.SkinnedMesh construct the model is \"posed\".

I think each bone takes four vec4-uniforms (a matrix4, basically). If you have 90 bones, that's 90*4=360 uniforms. Then you add uniforms for lighting, texturing and whatnot on top of that. Probably your hardware only supports 254 vertex shader uniforms, which is the most common limit:\n\nhttp:\/\/webglstats.com\/\n\nYou can verify this using the WebGL Inspector (under the State-tab):\n\nhttp:\/\/benvanik.github.com\/WebGL-Inspector\/\n\nMy MacBook pro supports 1024, which is enough to run your demo.

Sorry, that I asked faster than I think about this self ;) So the problem was, that the JITCompile, which is by default set on true, works wrong with the models. Is JITCompile important and what is it in detail? - I don't know it. What I know is, that when is set to false, it works brilliant.

Works really good on my 2.5-year old MacBook pro, too. \n\nThe JITCompile should increase animation update performance by at lot. The theory goes that you save all the matrices you calculate to a cache, so next time you come to that frame you simply take the cached matrix instead of interpolating quaternions and convert them into matrices. It should be pretty easy to implement, but obviously something is buggy :)\n","created_at":"2012-07-13T09:24:38.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/2106#issuecomment-6958274","id":6958274,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/2106","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NTgyNzQ=","updated_at":"2012-07-13T09:24:38.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/6958274","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/empaempa\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/empaempa\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/51464?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/empaempa","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/empaempa\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/empaempa","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/empaempa\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDY0","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/empaempa\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/empaempa\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/empaempa\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"empaempa","type":"User","id":51464,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/empaempa\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/empaempa\/orgs"}},{"index":28,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I think that's not my work at the moment ;D\n","created_at":"2012-07-13T09:29:14.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/2106#issuecomment-6958362","id":6958362,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/2106","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NTgzNjI=","updated_at":"2012-07-13T09:29:14.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/6958362","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/codeart1st\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/codeart1st\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/581407?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/codeart1st","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/codeart1st\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/codeart1st","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/codeart1st\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTQwNw==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/codeart1st\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/codeart1st\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/codeart1st\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"codeart1st","type":"User","id":581407,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/codeart1st\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/codeart1st\/orgs"}},{"index":29,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"> Great!
