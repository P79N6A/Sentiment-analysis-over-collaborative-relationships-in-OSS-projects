And the appropriate metric to use is going to be application-specific.\r\n\r\nThis is why I suggested, instead, a method that computes the delta quaternion itself and returns it.\r\n\r\nQuite frankly, I do not think that method really needs to be added to the library either. There is not a common name for it.\r\n\r\nSo, I would not add `Quaternion.angleTo( quaternion )`, and I would probably not add the \"delta\" method, either, but I would not oppose adding it.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-07T22:49:16.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/14422#issuecomment-403247859","id":403247859,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14422","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzI0Nzg1OQ==","updated_at":"2018-07-07T22:49:16.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/403247859","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1000017?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/WestLangley","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDAwMTc=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"WestLangley","type":"User","id":1000017,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/orgs"}},{"index":12,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Reopening the PR with a simplified version of the code.
