I know it has that meaning in a broader (shell only?) sense, but would think its mentioned there for parsers to implement if it was something common\/supported\/recommended? Note that many of the examples on the spec do use `\\` but to me this seems more of a 80 char wide formatting thing, rather than something it recommends people should do.\n\nPersonally would rather encourage people to cleanup their asset files. I would be surprised if any exporters write these `\\` to split lines. At the same the parser should not crash on this. Are you really saying eg. Chrome tab crashes on it? Its just going to end up doing `parseFloat(\"\\\")` Or webgl crashes rendering the produced geometry?\n\nTo check this while doing line by line parsing would probably be expensive and penalize users with \"correct\" assets in load time. The regexp replace to the whole content string is probably the fastest way to go, if we want to encourage these kind of files.\n\nSummary: I think this is ugly and users should cleanup their assets instead. If the browser tab is really crashing on this, I will take a look.\n\n@ThomasPahler can you upload a example asset for me? How was it produced (what exporter) or where did you find it?\n\n**Edit:** quick chrome console test `parseFloat(\"\\\\\") > NaN` no problemo. Maybe we should throw exception on NaN. This NaN check will be ran millions of times for large obj files in the most heavily used functions in the loader, I'll need to profile the impact.\n","created_at":"2016-05-19T21:20:00.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/8928#issuecomment-220455411","id":220455411,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8928","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMDQ1NTQxMQ==","updated_at":"2016-05-19T21:36:58.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/220455411","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/157519?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/jonnenauha","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzUxOQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"jonnenauha","type":"User","id":157519,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@kaisalmen What do you think about this issue?
