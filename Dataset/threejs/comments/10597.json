By account for the zoom speed of your fingers, then the zoom in\/out is much smaller and there is no noticeable jitter caused by the camera zooming in and out.\r\n\r\nBy putting it where he did this handles zoom smoothing for all zoom events though. So here's an example where I use middle-click to show the zoom jitter in the current version vs the PR. The PR handles zoomer in a much smoother fashion. \r\n\r\ngif of zooming behavior: http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/veWgV ","created_at":"2017-04-19T21:30:36.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/10597#issuecomment-295451875","id":295451875,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10597","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTQ1MTg3NQ==","updated_at":"2017-04-19T21:30:36.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/295451875","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/13877593?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/XanderLuciano","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODc3NTkz","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"XanderLuciano","type":"User","id":13877593,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/orgs"}},{"index":13,"author_association":"NONE","body":"@WestLangley, the \"speed\" here is really the change in distance between the touch points, and that is used to modulate the existing zoomSpeed property. Instead of the change being simply positive or negative, the amount of change is taken into account. My second comment on Jan 18 goes into more detail.\r\n\r\nI did originally try doing this with the mouse wheel (WheelEvent), but it has no obvious effect because the wheel events are fairly low-precision. I think we would need to animate between successive events to get a smooth result, which is beyond the scope of this change.","created_at":"2017-04-19T21:31:39.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/10597#issuecomment-295452377","id":295452377,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10597","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTQ1MjM3Nw==","updated_at":"2017-04-19T21:31:39.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/295452377","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MauricioVives\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MauricioVives\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/14087190?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MauricioVives","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MauricioVives\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/MauricioVives","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MauricioVives\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDg3MTkw","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MauricioVives\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MauricioVives\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MauricioVives\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"MauricioVives","type":"User","id":14087190,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MauricioVives\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MauricioVives\/orgs"}},{"index":14,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Dear MauricioVives  & WestLangley,\r\n\r\nWe are researchers working on identifying redundant development and duplicated pull requests.
