I'm not proposing the addition of any methods to `Matrix4` - I'm proposing what subset of its functionality would be both intuitive and useful if present analogously in `Matrix3`. I realize there are as many opinions on what to include in a linear algebra class as there are linear algebra libraries, but I'd argue multiplication is not a controversial one.\r\n\r\nMy latest, specific use case that motivated this PR is to fit arbitrarily sized, user-submitted images to a prescribed width and height, and then scaling to NPOT for use as a texture. This is implemented as a product of up to three 3x3 affine matrices expressing 2D transforms: `npotScale \u2022 coverFit \u2022 arbitrary`. `coverFit` is computed and applied after examining `arbitrary`, which scales the image up to fill the target rectangle - but only if necessary. NPOT scaling is also done here to obviate three's handling of it at a predictable point in the application code. But even if I left that to three's autoscaling, I'm still multiplying at least two `Matrix3`s. A quick non-rigorous assessment of my options are:\r\n- pushing it down to a GLSL `*` of two `mat3`s, and applying it to the uvs\r\n- importing a separate library and doing all 3x3 matrix operations with that\r\n- writing a standalone function\r\n- monkeypatching `Matrix3`\r\n- the actual approach I went with, creating equivalent `Matrix4`s which apply no transform in the Z axis, then transferring back to a `Matrix3`.\r\n\r\nAll of these feel like coding around an interface wart - especially for such a fundamental operation, especially as a method present in matrices of one size and not another.","created_at":"2017-03-29T01:42:06.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/11080#issuecomment-289956524","id":289956524,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11080","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTk1NjUyNA==","updated_at":"2017-03-29T01:55:29.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/289956524","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1080102?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/yellcorp","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODAxMDI=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"yellcorp","type":"User","id":1080102,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I included `multiplyToArray` for parity alone, so I won't defend its addition if the 4 equivalent is gone.","created_at":"2017-03-29T01:43:58.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/11080#issuecomment-289956778","id":289956778,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11080","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTk1Njc3OA==","updated_at":"2017-03-29T01:43:58.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/289956778","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1080102?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/yellcorp","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODAxMDI=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"yellcorp","type":"User","id":1080102,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yellcorp\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> I'd argue multiplication is not a controversial one.\r\n\r\nNeither are addition and subtraction. \r\n\r\nWhat is the argument for not adding those methods, too?\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nThis is not a math library.
