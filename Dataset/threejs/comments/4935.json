Where in the shader code would someone put something to select the mirrored half of the model and swap a channel on the normal map?\n\nEdit:\nFurther research on the subject shows that multiplying the bitangent with the W component of the tangent seems to handle this automagically. I have no idea how that translates into the way that Three.js computes normals for the Phong shader. It looks like the \"Normal map shader\" may already do this?\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikibooks.org\/wiki\/GLSL_Programming\/Blender\/Lighting_of_Bumpy_Surfaces#Complete_Shader_Code\n\nhttp:\/\/forum.unity3d.com\/threads\/symmetric-models-with-mirrored-normal-maps-shader-fix.65859\/#post-420888\n","created_at":"2014-06-30T03:19:26.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/4935#issuecomment-47491718","id":47491718,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/4935","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NDkxNzE4","updated_at":"2014-06-30T04:34:45.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/47491718","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tranek\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tranek\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1534735?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tranek","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tranek\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/tranek","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tranek\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ3MzU=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tranek\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tranek\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tranek\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"tranek","type":"User","id":1534735,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tranek\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tranek\/orgs"}},{"index":12,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Isn't it possible to create another material and set the `normalScale.x` value to `-1`?\n","created_at":"2014-06-30T08:04:38.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/4935#issuecomment-47504520","id":47504520,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/4935","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NTA0NTIw","updated_at":"2014-06-30T08:04:38.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/47504520","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/shi-314\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/shi-314\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/4512048?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/shi-314","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/shi-314\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/shi-314","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/shi-314\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTIwNDg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/shi-314\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/shi-314\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/shi-314\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"shi-314","type":"User","id":4512048,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/shi-314\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/shi-314\/orgs"}},{"index":13,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Isn't it possible to create another material and set the normalScale.x value to -1?\n\nWouldn't you need a separate mesh for the mirrored half?

If you apply multiple materials to an object e.g. in Maya and export it as an OBJ your Mesh will have a MeshFaceMaterial which is just a list of materials. You can iterate over the materials and replace them by their name with the material you want.\n\nAh I see. That makes sense.
