Well, that is definitely an issue. `.flipY` is by default true for us, so the first byte pushed to the GPU is the lower left, not the upper left.\r\n\r\nSo that begs the question: \"How could any of your glTF models have rendered correctly?\" Your uv's must be flipped, too.\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough, the spec says uv ( 0, 0 ) is the upper-left.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/KhronosGroup\/glTF\/tree\/master\/specification\/2.0#images\r\n\r\nIn three.js, uv ( 0, 0 ) is the lower-left -- or maybe it is more correct to say the uv ( 0, 0 ) corresponds to the first byte in the data buffer.\r\n\r\nSo, you can flip all your uvs, too. I expect things will start to make more sense, then...\r\n\r\nNow, I expect you don't want to do that, so I think you can leave things as they are.\r\n\r\nTo compensate, you will have to flip `normalScale.y` when you load the model. When you export the model, you flip it back, so it is a positive value.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-08T01:26:45.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/13784#issuecomment-379511456","id":379511456,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/13784","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTUxMTQ1Ng==","updated_at":"2018-04-08T01:27:49.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/379511456","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1000017?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/WestLangley","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDAwMTc=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"WestLangley","type":"User","id":1000017,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/orgs"}},{"index":12,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Ok thanks \u2014 that makes sense.
