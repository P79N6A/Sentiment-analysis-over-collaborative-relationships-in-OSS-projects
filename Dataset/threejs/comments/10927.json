We'll probably have to add something like `viewport` to `PerspectiveCamera` so we can control where they render (this may make `renderer.viewport` redundant). Lets keep in mind that there are more uses to this than just stereo, https:\/\/www.leia3d.com\/ for instance renders a grid of 4x4 per frame.\r\n\r\n`WebGLRenderer.render()` will then check `isArrayCamera`. It will then do all the projecting using the main camera and then it will render the scene using the cameras in the array. @toji suggested that the best way would be to alternate viewport for each object being rendered (apparently changing the viewport is cheap).","created_at":"2017-03-06T05:02:34.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10927#issuecomment-284303588","id":284303588,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10927","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDMwMzU4OA==","updated_at":"2017-03-06T05:02:34.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/284303588","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/97088?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDg4","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"mrdoob","type":"User","id":97088,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/orgs"}},{"index":1,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Viewport is frequently a cheap change to make, may not always be the cheapest thing. That's an area that can be tweaked pretty easily though. `ArrayCamera` would also allow for some interesting instancing tricks in some cases, as well as enabling [`OVR_multiview`](https:\/\/www.khronos.org\/registry\/OpenGL\/extensions\/OVR\/OVR_multiview.txt)-style extensions if\/when WebGL gets them.\r\n\r\nOne thing I'd like to propose in conjunction with this is instead of (or in addition to) a `StereoCamera` a more explicit `VRCamera` that automatically sets the viewports and such from WebVR *and* explicitly includes head movement (so no need to attach it to a `VRControls`.) This is because the current split between `VREffect` and `VRControls` necessitates some ugly matrix math to try and negate the pose transform from the view matrices that WebVR provides. (`VRControls` is still useful, it just maybe shouldn't be the recommended way of handling camera motion.)","created_at":"2017-03-06T21:40:28.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10927#issuecomment-284541915","id":284541915,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10927","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NDU0MTkxNQ==","updated_at":"2017-03-06T21:40:28.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/284541915","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/toji\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/toji\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/805273?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/toji","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/toji\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/toji","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/toji\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNTI3Mw==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/toji\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/toji\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/toji\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"toji","type":"User","id":805273,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/toji\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/toji\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I

Turns out that generalized frusta unions aren't trivial. Go figure! Anyway, we'll keep looking at it from that end but I wanted to propose a slightly-less-hacky approach to culling as an interm step.\r\n\r\nBasic idea is to have the camera supply the renderer with a generic \"Culling Volume\" rather than the renderer computing the frustum from the camera each frame, and intersection tests would be done against it. For normal cameras it would return a `Frustum` object, so that case should have no performance difference. For an `ArrayCamera` it could return an object that tests against a Frustum for each camera in the array and returns true if the object is in any of them.\r\n\r\nThere's some (very much untested) code here for reference: https:\/\/github.com\/toji\/three.js\/commit\/a8042b518197b25b7c3ee66c105cbbdb4bbe14f6\r\n\r\nObviously this isn't the ideal method for WebVR camera, but it would be more correct in the meantime and could be swapped out for a better method once we work out the math. Also it may actually be the \"right\" answer for a more generic array camera that's not always guaranteed to have largely similar frusta. (Like if you had two cameras facing 180deg apart.)\r\n\r\nThoughts?

If you want to add a HUD you're going to add it to the main camera, so it won't be visible on the VRCamera?
