That parameter modulated the specular reflectance of the material for non-metals only -- in other words, how reflective non-metals are. I expect @bhouston wants to reintroduce `reflectivity` into the future `MeshPhysicalMaterial`.\n\nNow regarding `MeshPhongMaterial`, the way we handle environment maps in that case is quite different, and was not changed. We have a `combine` parameter that specifies how the color of the material and the color of the envMap are to be blended. This is not physical. \n\n``` glsl\n#ifdef ENVMAP_BLENDING_MULTIPLY\n\n    outgoingLight = mix( outgoingLight, outgoingLight * envColor.xyz, specularStrength * reflectivity );\n\n#elif defined( ENVMAP_BLENDING_MIX )\n\n    outgoingLight = mix( outgoingLight, envColor.xyz, specularStrength * reflectivity );\n\n#elif defined( ENVMAP_BLENDING_ADD )\n\n    outgoingLight += envColor.xyz * specularStrength * reflectivity;\n\n#endif\n```\n\n`specularStrength` is 1 if there is no `specularMap`.\n\n`reflectivity` should be a quantity between 0 and 1 in the first 2 cases. Plus, it is a property of the material.\n\n`envMapIntenstiy` is any positive number, and is really a property of the map -- not the material.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, I am thinking that some changes are in order...\n1. `envMapIntenstiy` should be a property of the environment map. So all materials that use the same environment map are illuminated the same.\n2. `reflectivity` should remain a property of Phong, Lambert, Basic.\n3. Eventually, `envMap` should be removed from at least `MeshStandardMaterial` in favor of a new `LightProbe` light source. In that case, what we would call a \"distant light probe\" replaces the environment map, and \"light probe intensity\" replaces `envMapIntensity`.\n4. And in a related issue, whether a material is reflective or refractive should be decoupled from the format of the environment map.\n\n\/ping @bhouston \n","created_at":"2015-12-08T22:31:16.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7704#issuecomment-163040169","id":163040169,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7704","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MzA0MDE2OQ==","updated_at":"2015-12-08T22:31:16.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/163040169","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1000017?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/WestLangley","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDAwMTc=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"WestLangley","type":"User","id":1000017,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Environment should be turned into the type LightProbe as I've already sort of designed it to be that way in the shaders.
