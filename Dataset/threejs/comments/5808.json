This simplifies the specification of the parameters.  Thus the specification of the parameters in any form you want (repeat\/scale, or the order of operations) can be done via the existing setters on Matrix3 or one could create specialized Texture transform helpers someplace.\n\nI'd recommend this approach, it is straightforward and likely will not need to be updated as we go along - as it is the general and powerful approach.\n\nBTW in classic fixed function OpenGL, they used a 4x4 texture matrix and this generalized well to 3D textures (which can be 3 vec4s , 12 floats, if you do not need projection.)  I am not sure we have to go there for the time being, because that is a big price to pay for the rarely used 3D texture capability.

This isn't a very common case.  Thus maybe one could just add to Geometry, an applyMatrixToUVs( matrix3 ) or something like that.  And remove all transform-related parameters (offset, repeat.)  You either write your own or you pre-apply it to the geometry.  That will actually make things simplier both in the code and in the shaders.\n","created_at":"2014-12-29T19:44:29.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/5808#issuecomment-68295036","id":68295036,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/5808","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4Mjk1MDM2","updated_at":"2014-12-29T19:59:43.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/68295036","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/588541?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/bhouston","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODU0MQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"bhouston","type":"User","id":588541,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/orgs"}},{"index":23,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I wrote a UVTransform operator for Clara.io today and got this result of a test -- just hit play:\n\nhttps:\/\/clara.io\/view\/94f492f6-9336-4a4c-91b1-26e3a43e4a57\/webgl\n\nIt runs at 60 fps., but only with 1600 vertices.\n","created_at":"2014-12-31T20:25:41.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/5808#issuecomment-68467185","id":68467185,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/5808","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NDY3MTg1","updated_at":"2015-01-06T16:01:29.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/68467185","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/588541?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/bhouston","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODU0MQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"bhouston","type":"User","id":588541,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/orgs"}},{"index":24,"author_association":"NONE","body":"just great! thx so much!\n","created_at":"2014-12-31T20:34:53.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/5808#issuecomment-68467646","id":68467646,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/5808","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NDY3NjQ2","updated_at":"2015-01-05T13:38:25.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/68467646","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Ekki\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Ekki\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/487083?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Ekki","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Ekki\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Ekki","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Ekki\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzA4Mw==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Ekki\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Ekki\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Ekki\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Ekki","type":"User","id":487083,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Ekki\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Ekki\/orgs"}},{"index":25,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Happy New Year guys, BTW...\n\nAgain, Ben, this looks great!
