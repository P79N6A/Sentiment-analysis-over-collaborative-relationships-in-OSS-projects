I have written such a GLSL preprocessor for a project in C++ once, for the same reason (to support `#include`). Apart from basic #include support, it had the the following additional functionality:\n- Automatically include each file only once, as if each file had a [#pragma once](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pragma_once). I have used low level .glsl files with struct\/type definitions, intermediate .glsl files with individual function definitions, and high level .glsl files with whole shaders. This lead to dependencies like this: A includes B and C; B and C both include D.\n  - I have implemented this by adding an additional parameter to `ShaderPreprocessor.preprocess`, which stored the names of files\/chunks already included.\n- Support for dynamic defines. When asking for a preprocessed shader source, you could pass a list of key\/value pairs that would be translated to `#define {key} {value}` lines, which would then be prepended to the final shader source.This was useful when testing shaders or creating shaders with configuration-dependent constants.\n  - When caching compiled shaders (not just the shader source), the cache needs to be aware of this functionality.\n","created_at":"2015-03-23T17:09:02.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/6273#issuecomment-85098974","id":85098974,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6273","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1MDk4OTc0","updated_at":"2015-03-23T17:09:02.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/85098974","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/577871?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/crobi","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Nzg3MQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"crobi","type":"User","id":577871,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/crobi\/orgs"}},{"index":1,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"I like the idea :+1: \n","created_at":"2015-03-24T22:29:17.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/6273#issuecomment-85719419","id":85719419,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6273","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NzE5NDE5","updated_at":"2015-03-24T22:29:17.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/85719419","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/97088?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDg4","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"mrdoob","type":"User","id":97088,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"glslify might be something to look at? https:\/\/github.com\/stackgl\/glslify also has interesting includes like https:\/\/github.com\/aras-p\/glsl-optimizer\n","created_at":"2015-04-06T06:35:30.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/6273#issuecomment-89945295","id":89945295,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6273","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg5OTQ1Mjk1","updated_at":"2015-04-06T06:35:30.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/89945295","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1142958?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/benaadams","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDI5NTg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"benaadams","type":"User","id":1142958,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"NONE","body":"The examples of this pullrequest are now built and visible in threejsworker.
