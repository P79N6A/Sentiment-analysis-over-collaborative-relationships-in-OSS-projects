In the code I haven't find this kind of classes.\n\nUV mapping is my biggest concern and I don't know how to address the problem.\n- First I need to write code for each geometry where I want custom UVs. That's ok.\n- Second I need a way for my new UVs to be serialized. If I'm right, it means change the geometry type, because my changes will not be serialized for any geometry that is not of type 'Geometry' or 'BufferGeometry', and the size of the information serialized is not the same. That's a problem because change the UV of a 'LatheGeometry' is something I can code, but change the UV of a 'Geometry' is something I can't code, even if in fact it's a LatheGeometry with custom UVs. So I can change UVs once but not twice.\n\nSo I'm really interesting by anything you could have written on that aspect.\n","created_at":"2016-01-20T12:55:58.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/7991#issuecomment-173195969","id":173195969,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7991","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MzE5NTk2OQ==","updated_at":"2016-01-20T12:55:58.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/173195969","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rfm1201\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rfm1201\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/3810815?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rfm1201","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rfm1201\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/rfm1201","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rfm1201\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTA4MTU=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rfm1201\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rfm1201\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rfm1201\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"rfm1201","type":"User","id":3810815,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rfm1201\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rfm1201\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> I think I would prefer to keep the generators as simple as possible.\r\n\r\nCorrect.
