I don't think renderer.capabilities.logarithmicDepthBuffer shouldn't be changed at runtime. \r\n\r\nFair enough.  I was attempting a workaround for [this issue](https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7815) in my particular case.  I can modify my code to define the render after I know enough information to decide if the renderer should use logarithmic depth buffer or not.  All that being said, it does not change the fact that `logarithmicDepthBuffer: true` causes shader compile errors on Firefox for Android in both cases described in this issue.","created_at":"2017-01-28T06:04:45.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10664#issuecomment-275829942","id":275829942,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10664","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTgyOTk0Mg==","updated_at":"2017-01-28T09:11:17.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/275829942","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fraguada\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fraguada\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1014562?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fraguada","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fraguada\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/fraguada","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fraguada\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTQ1NjI=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fraguada\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fraguada\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fraguada\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"fraguada","type":"User","id":1014562,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fraguada\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fraguada\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I'm unable to reproduce with latest Firefox 61 on Android 8.1.
