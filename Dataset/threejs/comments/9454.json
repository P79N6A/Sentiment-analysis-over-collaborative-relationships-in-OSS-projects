They are all pointing down, so in the scene, if you look from above, you won't see anything, unless you use \"THREE.DoubleSide\" on your material, thereby disabling backface culling for that material specifically. That is not the fault of THREE.js - your model is just created that way.\n\n> The main problem with partially smoothed objects. If you try to restore the normal in threejs, smooth becomes the whole object\n\n@acopalipsis You need to split the edges by duplicating the vertices of the edge. Easiest way to do this, is using blender's edge-split modifier. This is not THREE.js specific. But I don't think this is the right place for a general \"Creating game assets in Blender\" discussion. \n\nI can't say anything about the three.js editor - never used it.
