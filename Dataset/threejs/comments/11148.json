According to the the [cached page](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160511083736\/http:\/\/home.xyzw.us\/~cass\/qcoord\/), there's an implementation of this somewhere, where \"instead of specifying the texture coordinates for the upper vertices as (s,t) coordinates of (0, 1) and (1, 1), we can specify them as (s,t,r,q) coordinates of (0, width, 0, width) and (width, width, 0, width)\", i.e. you can make OpenGL project the texture properly.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is something Three.js should do or it should be left to developers to sort out (as @Mugen87 said), and in the latter case, feel free to #wontfix and close this issue if you reach that consensus as maintainers.\r\n\r\nI should also mention that I only raised this issue out of principle \u2014 I haven't used Three.js in years, so if you deem it unimportant, then I'm perfectly ok with a \"this is not something we want to support\" and that would give me the closure that letting an issue age out wouldn't.\r\n\r\nIn that case, a message to future googlers: you can work around this and approximate a non-affine transform by adding more faces; just map the texture over more detailed geometry until the trade-off between quality and performance is satisfactory.","created_at":"2017-04-13T12:07:37.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11148#issuecomment-293874908","id":293874908,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11148","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5Mzg3NDkwOA==","updated_at":"2017-04-13T12:07:37.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/293874908","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yousefamar\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yousefamar\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/999235?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yousefamar","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yousefamar\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/yousefamar","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yousefamar\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTIzNQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yousefamar\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yousefamar\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yousefamar\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"yousefamar","type":"User","id":999235,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yousefamar\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/yousefamar\/orgs"}},{"index":6,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Definitely did not see this :).
