Also see generic solutions such as: https:\/\/github.com\/pimterry\/loglevel.\n\nI'm sure you've run into a lot of situations where people don't know what version they're using and don't know how to run `THREE.revision` in the console (or change the console context to the iframe situation you mention) and can empathize with that.\n\nBut I'm not even suggesting you remove it -- I've retained the current functionality where the default setting is to _still_ log out the version number.\n\nI think @bhouston is on the right track with the logging wrappers, but with your recent revert on the change that was relevant to this PR, I can't suggest it for my purposes -- it should be all or nothing. \n\nMy use case is purely for integration testing: I'm using dozens and dozens of libraries and the only thing polluting my test runners output is this one line.\n\nThink it's an anti-pattern to be noisy regardless of the desire of the developer which is why you don't see `jQuery: version 2.1.1`
