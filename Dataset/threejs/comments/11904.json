Use this only if you do not wish to manage both a Orthographic and Perspective Camera._\r\n\r\nSo `StereoCamera ` is not supported right now and just adding a new property to `CombinedCamera` is not sufficient. When i look at the code, it seems like `CombinedCamera`  is not designed to support `StereoCamera` at all. There are methods like `.toPerspective()` or `.toOrthographic()` but no `.toStereo()`. Other existing methods also need to be revisited in this context.
