Should we make decay 2 by default?\n\nI think it is the right thing to do.  It will take some getting used to.  Light intensities will have to be a lot higher than they where before.\n\nHere is a guide to what the light powers for normal lights in a house should be:\n- 40-watt incandescent bulb = 450 lumens\n- 60-watt incandescent bulb = 800 lumens\n- 100-watt incandescent bulb = 1600 lumens\n\nPeople who have setup their scene such that they are a kilometer in size, like a bunch of our examples, will find they require really bright lights, because well to light up something a kilometer away requires a 1M lumen light.  The solution isn't really to setup bright lights, but rather to change the scale of the scene so that it isn't a kilometer wide.\n\nWe should likely change a lot of the example scenes so they are all realistically sized -- this will help encourage people to use scale properly, rather than arbitrarily.  Many of the examples are nearly a kilometer in width right now, I guess because 1000 is sort of a easy number to write.\n","created_at":"2015-11-17T05:12:36.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/7609#issuecomment-157271312","id":157271312,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7609","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzI3MTMxMg==","updated_at":"2015-11-18T01:43:06.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/157271312","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/588541?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/bhouston","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODU0MQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"bhouston","type":"User","id":588541,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/orgs"}},{"index":6,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"So the new lights won't use `distance` anymore, right?

Just intensity (lumens) and decay.\n\nMost real-time engines (Frostbite 3 and UE4 and Unity3D) still use `distance` to force a cutoff for efficiency sake, and to limit constant (decay = 0) lights.  So we left that in using the Frostbite and UE4 convention.\n\nUnity3D only uses decay = 2, and it is super hard to change it.  UE4 provides full decay control.  V-Ray only supports decay = 2 or no decay (decay = 0).  Frostbite only supports decay = 2 (from what I could tell, they do not have an easy to access editor.)\n\n> Not only light decay depend on realistically sized scenes, VR also benefits from that... 1 unit = 1 meter then, right?\n\nHaving realistically scaled scenes will help everyone using ThreeJS, even just with asset transfer.  Ammo.js doesn't work well with non SI units as well.  The editor seems to default to creating cubes that are 100x100x100, which is a little big and gets people off to the wrong start with units.  I'd suggest that the editor by default creates objects with a scale in the range of 1x1x1 (1m^3) to 0.1x0.1x0.1 (10cm^3).\n","created_at":"2015-11-17T15:59:07.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/7609#issuecomment-157413070","id":157413070,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7609","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzQxMzA3MA==","updated_at":"2015-11-17T15:59:38.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/157413070","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/588541?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/bhouston","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODU0MQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"bhouston","type":"User","id":588541,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/orgs"}},{"index":8,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"It's also easier to get good results with navmesh navigation using realistically scaled meshes.
