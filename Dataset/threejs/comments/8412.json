I'm going to try to tackle the complex animation file today. There's a lot of unspoken assumptions that will break this process. If you want rigged animations: You **can't** export a single selected mesh. You **can't** load it with the JSONLoader. You **must** check the hierarchy tab. You **must** load it with the ObjectLoader.\n\nThis is counter intuitive because the model being exported is JSON. If I didn't manually inspect the source code of BlendCharacter.js I wouldn't have seen the ObjectLoader, and even then it wouldn't have been obvious why the vanilla JSON loader won't work here. I suspect there are still some bugs in the toolchain, possibly around the JSON loader, possibly around the AnimationHelper class, possibly in the exporter. I will try to narrow down what causes issues.\n\nThanks for the help!\n","created_at":"2016-04-18T16:22:05.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/8412#issuecomment-211453959","id":211453959,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8412","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMTQ1Mzk1OQ==","updated_at":"2016-04-18T16:22:05.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/211453959","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/79215?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/AndrewRayCode","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MjE1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"AndrewRayCode","type":"User","id":79215,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/orgs"}},{"index":19,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"You're totally right.
