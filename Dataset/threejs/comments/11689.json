I am not 100% clear on what you were addressing with your patch, but I do know that there are a number of issues with the exporter, including animation.\r\n\r\nI am looking at some of these problems right now:\r\n\r\nI suspect if a bone is exported that is marked as a non-transforming bone, it appears to not get handled the same as contributing bones. and doesn't get exported in the animation hierarchy, *even if* the bone is actually part of the animation hierarchy, just unassigned, resulting in broken actions. Once I fix this, then I can address the exporting of partial animations...\r\n\r\nModifiers can be applied on animations, which used to be fine, but now the Armature binding is done as a modifier in current versions of Blender, so applying Armature modifiers, modifies the mesh and destroys its bind pose. So for animations that happen to be exported FROM the bind bind pose, this didn't cause a problem, but attempting to export the mesh at a different frame, could hose the bind pose.\r\n\r\nBy default, an edge split modifier is being added\/applied to meshes, and then normals are being recomputed. This seems like a bad idea, since it destroys the normals that were authored into the mesh.\r\n\r\nArmatures that have different scaling\/rotation than the meshes attached to them, are not handled properly. In Blender, the Armature is the parent of the animated assembly. In three.js the SkinnedMesh is the root, and the Armature bones are children.. therefore there is a coordinate frame switch that has to be done in the exporter, and this is currently broken, so variations in s\/r\/t between skin and armature, are causing breakage. This applies to both \"pose\" and rest mode animations.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have fixed some of these issues locally.. and am in the process of investigating the previous issue.\r\n\r\nCan you, or @mrdoob, point me to the .blend sources for the meshes used in the three.js demos?\r\nAnd also, if you have the .blend for the Knight animation, that would be helpful as well....\r\nI'd like to test with a good cross section of models in the wild..\r\nI've already found the .blend files in examples\/models\/skinned.\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-26T21:33:31.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/11689#issuecomment-318189247","id":318189247,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11689","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODE4OTI0Nw==","updated_at":"2017-07-26T21:40:02.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/318189247","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/350247?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/manthrax","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDI0Nw==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"manthrax","type":"User","id":350247,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/orgs"}},{"index":17,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@manthrax I don't have the knights blend file, but I do have my test scene.. The only issue is that my scene contains 11 armatures, and with the 'bug' in the current io_three where it exports every action with every armature it becomes super bloated, so I've got a copy of my latest version of my exporter io_tres included with it. \r\n\r\n[rel_multi_armature_test_scene.zip](https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/files\/1178276\/rel_multi_armature_test_scene.zip)\r\n\r\nAs for this patch, the loader currently (unpatched) does something similar to:\r\n```\r\nfor a in animations {\r\n  for h in range(0,len(a.hierarchy)) {\r\n   b = bones[h] # This is incorrect and only works when all bones are defined in the hierarchy for this one\r\n   for k in hierarchy[h].keys {\r\n    add keyframe k with bone b \r\n   }\r\n }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt assumes each bone is going to be in each animation, and completely ignores the 'parent' value on the hierarchy. It works fine as long as all bones are in every hierarchy on every animation.\r\n\r\nIf we used your example from before, say we have an animation where the torso never moves, and one removed the keys for the torso bone in the json for the animation. Now what happens, because which bone is being used is assumed by the loop, every bone will be animated (including the torso) - except for the very last bone in the array (left foot). \r\nRemove the torso bits from the json, the torso animates with the keys set for hip, the hip animates with the spineA, spineA animates with spineB's keys, so on and so forth. \r\n\r\nThe small change simply makes it do\r\n```\r\nb = bones[hierarchy[h].parent+1]\r\n```\r\nso if you were to remove the torso animations from the json, it will animate everything properly using the correct bones, and the torso won't get touched when playing this animation.","created_at":"2017-07-26T23:10:54.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/11689#issuecomment-318209431","id":318209431,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11689","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODIwOTQzMQ==","updated_at":"2017-07-26T23:13:07.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/318209431","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/centerionware\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/centerionware\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/76805?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/centerionware","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/centerionware\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/centerionware","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/centerionware\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2ODA1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/centerionware\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/centerionware\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/centerionware\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"centerionware","type":"User","id":76805,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/centerionware\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/centerionware\/orgs"}},{"index":18,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think we are roughly on the same page... and from what I can tell so far, your change will be vital to getting partial animations to work correctly\/out of the box.

I am going to make the exporter export proper indices, and then also propose including your fix, but without the \"-1\" on the \"parent\".. so, I appreciate you noticing this, and I'm looking into it, but I don't think we want to include your workaround, since it is reliant on the quirks of the exporter bugs.","created_at":"2017-07-30T05:38:47.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/11689#issuecomment-318880123","id":318880123,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11689","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxODg4MDEyMw==","updated_at":"2017-07-30T05:38:47.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/318880123","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/350247?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/manthrax","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDI0Nw==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"manthrax","type":"User","id":350247,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/orgs"}}]}
