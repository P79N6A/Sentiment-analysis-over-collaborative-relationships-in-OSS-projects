In other words, the material property `color` describes how all light is reflected.\n\nIt sounds like the Max exporter needs to be updated.\n","created_at":"2015-07-16T18:45:59.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6856#issuecomment-122047003","id":122047003,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6856","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMjA0NzAwMw==","updated_at":"2015-07-16T18:45:59.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/122047003","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1000017?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/WestLangley","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDAwMTc=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"WestLangley","type":"User","id":1000017,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/orgs"}},{"index":1,"author_association":"NONE","body":"@westlangley Thank you for your comment and understanding. Maybe if any developer is willing, he\/she could modify the existing code to just suit the requirement so that even if the ambient is not exported in the way threeJs understands it, but atleast the model is exported? So that we don't have to sit and remove all the materials with ambient. Ready to apply exporter that would be, just like Blender's exporter. Hope am making sense.\nThanks for your time :)\n","created_at":"2015-07-17T06:35:47.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6856#issuecomment-122191793","id":122191793,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6856","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyMjE5MTc5Mw==","updated_at":"2015-07-17T06:35:47.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/122191793","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/hemantchhabra\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/hemantchhabra\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/5680977?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/hemantchhabra","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/hemantchhabra\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/hemantchhabra","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/hemantchhabra\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODA5Nzc=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/hemantchhabra\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/hemantchhabra\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/hemantchhabra\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"hemantchhabra","type":"User","id":5680977,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/hemantchhabra\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/hemantchhabra\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@hemantchhabra If I were you, I would not wait.
