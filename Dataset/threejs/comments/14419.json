Whether the BabylonJS and FBX2GLTF tools do the Phong-to-PBR conversion in a way that preserves Phong specular maps, I don't know \u2014 that would be a question for the repos of those tools. If you are trying to preserve the exact appearance of models using classic Phong shaders, you may have an easier time with other formats.\r\n\r\n> > The last thing to do is setting renderer.gammaOutput = true.\r\n> \r\n> That indicates buggy GLTF Loader (and it has to be fixed).\r\n\r\nThis is a deliberate decision and not a bug. Base color and emissive textures in glTF (and, typically, diffuse textures in any format...) are in sRGB colorspace. GLTFLoader marks them as such (`material.map.encoding = THREE.sRGBEncoding`), so that they're converted to linear colorspace for correct PBR lighting calculations. Finally colors should be converted back to sRGB (e.g. `renderer.gammaOutput=true`).\r\n\r\nIf you skip all of this, with any format, lighting calculations are incorrect. SEA3DLoader, FBXLoader, and ColladaLoader never touch the `.encoding` property of any texture, and leave it to the end user to change texture colorspace and renderer colorspace. I'm pretty confident that the large majority of three.js users are passing sRGB colors into three.js without converting, despite the fact that renderer lighting calculations assume linear colorspace, and getting results that are \"good enough\" but inconsistent with other engines and authoring environments. For correct results you should be using `renderer.gammaOutput=true`, and marking sRGB textures as sRGB.\r\n\r\nNone of these issue are specific to glTF (see https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11337), but with GLTFLoader we're trying to achieve consistency with other engines and 3D authoring environments, and have chosen to treat all sRGB textures as sRGB for a first step. If you're mixing models from other formats in the scene, then yes it's awkward, and you'd need to either mark the diffuse textures of those formats as sRGB or mark the colorspace on the glTF models to linear (the latter is incorrect for all model formats involved, but may look good enough if you don't need precise colors).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nIt does not seem like there is anything actionable here, unless there are specific issues we can report to the tools mentioned. @RemusMar if you are happy with your SEA3D workflow, that's great \u2014 I'm not interested in debating formats or persuading you to change from something that is already working well for you.","created_at":"2018-07-09T02:43:59.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14419#issuecomment-403344309","id":403344309,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14419","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMzM0NDMwOQ==","updated_at":"2018-07-09T02:48:20.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/403344309","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}},{"index":19,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> Could you update the online samples?\r\n\r\nRicardo,\r\nPHONG looks great with Diffuse + Specular only.\r\nPBR does not look great with BaseColor + MetallicRoughness only.\r\nThat's the main problem here.\r\nThe Normal\/Bump and Environment textures are irrelevant at this point.\r\nOn top of that: more texture layers = bigger file size and performances drop\r\n\r\n> If you skip all of this, with any format, lighting calculations are incorrect.

PBR calculations are done in linear space, with every engine I'm aware of. If you pass sRGB data into the renderer and pretend it's linear, the lighting and blending math will come out wrong. The difference is not huge, and so this not a major concern for many three.js users, but nevertheless it is not as good as it could be. For that reason, your \"good\" result example is not actually correct. But as you've said before, backward-compatibility is important, so I'm not here to advocate for changing any three.js defaults. But because glTF is a new format, and because we're trying to get PBR right, we're going to mark sRGB textures as sRGB, even if other loaders are not doing so.\r\n\r\nSee [this article about Unreal](http:\/\/artbyplunkett.com\/Unreal\/unrealgamma.html) \u2014 \r\n\r\n> ...textures that are used for color information should have the sRGB flag checked, and textures that are used for masks and numerical calculations in shaders and effects (like Normal maps) should have it unchecked.
