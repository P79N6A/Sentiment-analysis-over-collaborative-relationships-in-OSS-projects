The large file contains about 5700 objects, and about 3.8 million triangles altogether.\r\nBy watching the logging output, it seems like a lot of the export time comes from triangulating each object.. applying edge split modifiers, and recomputing normals.\r\nEvery object in the scene contains unique vertices. There is no instancing, even though the objects appear to have been instanced at one time.. so if you need to move forward with meshes like this, I'd look into getting the models before the hierarchy has been flattened, or do a preprocess to re-combine the instanced parts.\r\n\r\nSo I agree with your assessment that exporting this is too slow to be practical, but there are steps that could be taken to make it more amenable to fast exporting... and those steps will also translate to more efficient and higher performance rendering, since there wont be 57000 unique geometries being rendered.\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-06T14:16:06.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11256#issuecomment-306499682","id":306499682,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11256","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjQ5OTY4Mg==","updated_at":"2017-06-06T14:16:06.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/306499682","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/350247?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/manthrax","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDI0Nw==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"manthrax","type":"User","id":350247,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/orgs"}},{"index":15,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for the helpful comment.
