If it does turn out to be an issue we can revert this change, however for most people this will just remove an unnecessary node in the scene graph. \r\n\r\nActually the real issue here is that the FBXLoader is creating an extra top level `Group` in the first place. Really, it should be returning an object similar to what the ColladaLoader or GLTFLoader return. In the case of the FBXLoader it would look something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfbx = {\r\n    group,\r\n    models,\r\n    animations,\r\n    geometries,\r\n    skeletons,\r\n    materials,\r\n    textures\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first property `group` would be included to maintain backwards compatibility and would be equivalent to the current return object. I'm considering switching to this format, however obviously it would be a breaking change.
