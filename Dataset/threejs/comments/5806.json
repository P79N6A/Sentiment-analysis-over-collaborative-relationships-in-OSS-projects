rewritten the whole thing to remove Vertex and Triangle custom classes and turn all data into flat typed arrays with SharedArrayBuffers to support workers and sharing memory.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/codesandbox.io\/s\/qvx30mkzo6\r\n\r\nEach worker gets its range of vertices to process. Number of vertices \/ total workers * current worker\r\n\r\nRace conditions in workers and general mess of early prototype make optimisation fail sometimes and \"optimizeModel\" has to be clicked to try again. workersAmount in line 1379 sets amount of workers(defaults to navigator.hardwareConcurrency) \r\nFIELDS_NO sets amount of fields for faces and neighbours belonging to each vertex(these are 2 flat arrays. Their length: number of vertices * 50 fields for data each), currently it's set to 50 but it also works with 20 or 1000, there's also support for oversized fields in separate arrays. These oversize arrays are being copied instead of shared when creating workers so this needs improving.\r\n\r\nWithout stopping rendering in Codesandbox\r\nTested 22MB model with 225k vertices on 2 years old XPS 15 with i5 6300hq 4 cores and no hyper threading\r\nmain thread only - 120 seconds\r\n1 worker - 120 seconds\r\n2 workers - 33 seconds\r\n3 workers - 21 seconds\r\n4 workers - 14 seconds \r\n\r\nOn my PC with 16 cores works in 4-5 seconds when using 8 workers\r\n\r\nDue to security problems SharedArrayBuffer was disabled in Chrome for a while but now it's enabled by default.\r\n\r\nHere's the model I'm using for testing https:\/\/free3d.com\/3d-model\/angel-lucy-sculpture-46454.html\r\nDrag and drop FBX file where the doll is. The time being measured `console.time(\"Mesh simplification\");` is after model is loaded to before it's reassembled back into BufferGeometry. Reassembling takes ages due to faulty mesh result which must be worked on\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\nThe problem with vertex not being found is caused by workers working simultaneously in the same area. For now I limited amount of workers so each has to process at least 2000 vertices to avoid overcrowding. Synchronising start time instead of allowing each to work straight after receiving data may also help keeping them further away. For now try catch and retrying operation on the same vertex when computing edge collapse helped with 90% failures. Probably these problems can be solved or greatly improved without introducing communication between workers or atomics, which would be fun but too complex for now.","created_at":"2019-01-08T16:50:11.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/5806#issuecomment-452369939","id":452369939,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/5806","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MjM2OTkzOQ==","updated_at":"2019-01-08T23:14:48.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/452369939","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/DVLP\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/DVLP\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/5261364?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/DVLP","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/DVLP\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/DVLP","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/DVLP\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjEzNjQ=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/DVLP\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/DVLP\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/DVLP\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"DVLP","type":"User","id":5261364,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/DVLP\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/DVLP\/orgs"}}]}
