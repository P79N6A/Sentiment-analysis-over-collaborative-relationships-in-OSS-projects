Unfortunately I don't think we can merge this \u2014 the older working name of the extension, `KHR_lights`, was never ratified and has been removed from all tools I know of. In Blender it was (or should have been) marked as experimental. The final name is `KHR_lights_punctual`, and supporting the incorrect name will lead to confusion down the road. In addition, there were more differences from the earlier version of the extension than simply renaming it.\r\n\r\nIf you need help converting models that contain `KHR_lights` to use `KHR_lights_punctual`, I can probably help with that, but I don't think GLTFLoader should support `KHR_lights` directly.","created_at":"2018-11-20T17:57:57.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/15283#issuecomment-440371901","id":440371901,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/15283","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MDM3MTkwMQ==","updated_at":"2018-11-20T17:57:57.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/440371901","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}}]}
