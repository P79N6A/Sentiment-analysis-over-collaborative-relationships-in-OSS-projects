Yeah, that's another problem. But if you want solid white then `CanvasRenderer` can give you better results. The problem is that you were trying to have transparency in the one using `CanvasRenderer`.\n\nActually, you can probably make the `CanvasRenderer` one work too. You need to do this hack:\n\n``` javascript\nvar mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( color: 0xff0000, wireframe: true, wireframeLinewidth: 3 );\nscene.add( mesh );\n\nvar mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( color: 0xffaaaa, wireframe: true, wireframeLinewidth: 3 );\nmesh.flipSided = true;\nscene.add( mesh );\n```\n\nSo for each piece you have 2 meshes, the front side, using pure red. And the back side using pale red. That should give you the result you're after, and you can remove the white mesh in between.\n\nWell, at least that will work for the piece itself.
