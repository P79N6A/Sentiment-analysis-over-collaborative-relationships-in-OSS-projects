It should be agnostic of what @bhouston is talking about. I.e. here in particular it's one parameter that was discussed in the linked issue. \r\n\r\nWhat that parameter does, and if it breaks PBR or the universe, is not relevant here. What is relevant is that there was a texture parameter, and that someone was using textures filled with one constant color. This should make doing that easier. No need to go into photoshop, modify the textures, just assign the value you would otherwise save to that texture. \r\n\r\nThis pr does not modify the lighting equations in any way. GLSL wise, it only hooks another uniform which is already in full control by the user.
