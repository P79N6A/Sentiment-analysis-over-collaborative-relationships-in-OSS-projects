Somewhat less fragile.\n\nBut the issue remains.\n\nI did considered _adding_ a pose test to the buttons test.  There seemed one possible concern.  Flickering of controller tracking is fine.  VRPose properties can be transiently null.  Flickering of controller identity isn't.  Hopefully no one's gamepad.pose property will itself go transiently null.  But I've not seen any spec at all for how gamepad.pose is to behave.  Since the Vive and Touch controllers seem to have a currently unusual buttons profile, adding a pose test didn't seem to add much.  So I didn't.\n\nBut either way, with a pose test or without, the buttons test addresses a different issue.\n\nThe Vive headset has pose.  And a side button.  Also a button-like proximity sensor.\n\nIf the Vive headset is not currently returned by browser getGamepads(), it will be.  My stack already does.  Along with other non-controller things with buttons and pose.\n\n_Hmm... drawing with your head in the vive paint example could be fun..._\n\nI assume from the suggestion, that getGamepads(), on both Chrome and Firefox, _currently_ does not expose the Vive headset as a gamepad?  Or do they order the gamepads list to keep the headset after any controllers?  I'm on linux, and so haven't checked.\n\nIf they both order the headset after the controllers, that sounds like a convention.  Or an accident becoming a convention.  Perhaps not pretty, but the Gamepad spec doesn't say anything about order.  Then just looking for gamepad.pose could be fine, and this PR unhelpful.  And I'll follow the crowd.\n\nIf both browsers simply haven't gotten around to the headset yet, then looking only for gamepad.pose, is only a temporary patch.  And my stack is the sick canary.\n\nSo what's the Right Thing?  The examples require gamepads which provide pose, and several buttons with recognizable identity.  We can't do much about recognizable identity until gamepad.map matures.  But I suggest we check for pose and buttons.\n\nInteresting.  Perhaps that clarifies?  Reframing the test from \"recognize Vive controllers\" to \"what is needed for Vive examples?\"  A few buttons, a couple of axes, and pose.\n\nPerhaps something like the tl;dr above.\n","created_at":"2016-10-18T19:53:59.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/9865#issuecomment-254620115","id":254620115,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/9865","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDYyMDExNQ==","updated_at":"2016-10-18T19:53:59.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/254620115","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mncharity\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mncharity\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/104805?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mncharity","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mncharity\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mncharity","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mncharity\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDgwNQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mncharity\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mncharity\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mncharity\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"mncharity","type":"User","id":104805,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mncharity\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mncharity\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Since this class also supports Oculus and Microsoft controller now, the PR is no longer valid.","created_at":"2018-08-21T09:40:23.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/9865#issuecomment-414615293","id":414615293,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/9865","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDYxNTI5Mw==","updated_at":"2018-08-21T09:40:23.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/414615293","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/12612165?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mugen87","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Mugen87","type":"User","id":12612165,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/orgs"}}]}
