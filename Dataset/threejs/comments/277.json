BTW I'm entirely new to all this\nfront-end stuff (I'm a data standards \/ backend guy generally). But\nsince seeing your example at\nhttp:\/\/alteredqualia.com\/three\/examples\/webgl_particles_dynamic.html\nand a few other things, I decided it's time to learn since amazing\nthings are becoming possible in the browser. And then glsl.heroku.com\ntaught me about a new but familiar looking programming language. So\nI'm slogging through the back-reading on GL and starting by messing\naround with other people's examples. It's also forced me to go back\nand learn a bit of linear algebra, which is useful for the machine\nlearning stuff too.\n\nMy immediate particles interest comes from some work with data mining\nand recommender tools, eg. where we might have 100,000 book records\n(or millions, ...) and similarity measures between those books\ncomputed from library metadata. Previously I've worked in batch mode\nwith Gephi but taking screenshots is a crappy way of publishing-\nhttp:\/\/danbri.org\/words\/2011\/10\/11\/720 - and I've also done a bit of\nwork prototyping in Microsoft Silverlight's pivot viewer:\nhttp:\/\/danbri.org\/words\/2011\/02\/01\/658 where items are TV broadcasts\nor films.\n\nSo all the time each 'item' is not illustrated with its own texture, I\nthink I'm OK. But of course textures are attractive if we have a\ncollection of items and a picture for each already....\n\nThe trickiest ambition is to do something with Pivot-viewer style\nvisuals, where each item has its own texture.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DbN3kWenjJs ... Pivot-viewer (if you\ndidn't see it) is probably the most beautiful thing microsoft have\ndone inside a browser, http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ed_2i5grQHk\nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=F2foa4aBn_w but it is heavy to run.\n\nI'm not sure yet how much of that WebGL + Three.js makes easy. So I\nthought I'd start towards making some tests...\n\nIf I had only 300 or so base textures eg. from BBC TV shows (my\ncurrent work) and then individualised them by writing on them via\nCanvas, and if I used low-res imagery (maybe monochrome'd?), and made\nsure resolution were powers of two, ...? What if we had 3000?\n30,000...? I'm not really on top of the basics enough to do scientific\ntests but starting seems a good way of learning.\n\nAnyway thanks for the help on this issue. It's a good nudge to get\nlearning a bit more...\n\ncheers\n\nDan\n","created_at":"2011-12-05T08:04:25.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/277#issuecomment-3012412","id":3012412,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/277","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTI0MTI=","updated_at":"2011-12-05T08:04:25.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/3012412","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danbri\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danbri\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/170265?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danbri","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danbri\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/danbri","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danbri\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDI2NQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danbri\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danbri\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danbri\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"danbri","type":"User","id":170265,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danbri\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/danbri\/orgs"}},{"index":26,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For applications like you linked to the best would be probably to use texture atlases - concatenate offline many smaller images into fewer bigger ones, keep somewhere metadata about offsets \/ sizes and then use this to pick out just the relevant subimage in the shader.\n\nThat's what I think Google Bookcase does:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.chromeexperiments.com\/detail\/webgl-bookcase\/\n","created_at":"2011-12-05T11:50:47.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/277#issuecomment-3015982","id":3015982,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/277","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMTU5ODI=","updated_at":"2011-12-05T11:50:47.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/3015982","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/438022?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/alteredq","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzODAyMg==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"alteredq","type":"User","id":438022,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/orgs"}},{"index":27,"author_association":"NONE","body":"On 5 December 2011 12:50, AlteredQualia\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\n> For applications like you linked to the best would be probably to use texture atlases - concatenate offline many smaller images into fewer bigger ones, keep somewhere metadata about offsets \/ sizes and then use this to pick out just the relevant subimage in the shader.\n\nGreat, thanks.

I was thinking, what if I create like a small canvas and render one sprite\/particle that is red on the top half and green on the bottom half. And then I guess draw that to a 2dcanvas and pick the color at the top to see if it\u00b4s flipped or not. That way I would know if I should flip or not from there on.\n\nWould something like that work? Seems like a kinda hacky way :) Anyone got a better idea?\n","created_at":"2012-02-15T21:29:25.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/277#issuecomment-3989529","id":3989529,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/277","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODk1Mjk=","updated_at":"2012-02-15T21:29:25.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/3989529","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/oosmoxiecode\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/oosmoxiecode\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/513079?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/oosmoxiecode","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/oosmoxiecode\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/oosmoxiecode","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/oosmoxiecode\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzA3OQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/oosmoxiecode\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/oosmoxiecode\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/oosmoxiecode\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"oosmoxiecode","type":"User","id":513079,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/oosmoxiecode\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/oosmoxiecode\/orgs"}},{"index":29,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I was also thinking about something like this.
