In my case, no size in file, just png's and jpg's buffers. The w\/h of the image are set once the blob is complete. I would also still need to parse the headers of the streams to id jepg (FF D8) or png\/transparent to set RGB or RGBAFormat.\r\nAlso as there is no DataCubeTexture,(this bins also store envMaps, skyboxes etc..)  I'd be forced to do more or less what I did first.\r\n\r\nAll with all, if three would check if img.complete and handle a delay if img isn't null (vs just a warning and set size of 0 x 0 and upload) the engine would then build valid textures with no prob using \r\nvar text = new THREE.Texture();\r\ntext.image = myImageFromBLOBNotPerseComplete;\r\nmat.map =  text;\r\nwhich would remove the need to declare a loader that you actually don't need...\r\n\r\nAnyway, glad that it works for now... thx both of you!","created_at":"2017-12-20T12:50:04.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12915#issuecomment-353054803","id":353054803,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12915","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MzA1NDgwMw==","updated_at":"2017-12-20T12:50:23.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/353054803","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Fabrice3D\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Fabrice3D\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/550453?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Fabrice3D","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Fabrice3D\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Fabrice3D","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Fabrice3D\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDQ1Mw==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Fabrice3D\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Fabrice3D\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Fabrice3D\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Fabrice3D","type":"User","id":550453,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Fabrice3D\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Fabrice3D\/orgs"}}]}
