Just guessing here, we could change all `[member:name title]` entries inline to something more like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[member:title] () : [return:name]\r\n```\r\n\r\n... where the `: [return:name]` portion is omitted for methods returning null. I think that would result in 1 fewer lines of code, because the `[member:name] to [member:name title]` regex could be removed. Preference?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Oh there's your comment \ud83d\ude05  yeah i'm fine with leaving `: null` in, too.
