The choices you have is to either throw an error when this occurs or set the result to a default value.  In Matrix4.getInverse we provide an option to issue an error or not when the determinant is 0, and if one chooses to not have an error, we set the matrix to identity.  Here in Vector3 we just take the approach of setting a default value and hiding the error.\n\nGenerally the approach we have taken is the most common approach in 3D graphics libraries.  I could see it possible to pass in an option to throw an error when there is a divide by zero.  But I would highly highly recommend against allow for NaNs\/+-Infs be created -- that will lead to really hard to debug code and one NaN in a render will usually cause a lot of strange malfuntions in the shaders, they are not designed to handle NaN\/Inf - you will get dark or bright spots that look like bugs.\n","created_at":"2016-07-25T14:31:19.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/9387#issuecomment-234970022","id":234970022,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/9387","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDk3MDAyMg==","updated_at":"2016-07-25T14:31:19.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/234970022","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/588541?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/bhouston","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODU0MQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"bhouston","type":"User","id":588541,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"**Historical note**: The check for 0 was removed per the discussion in #10849","created_at":"2017-06-18T15:28:02.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/9387#issuecomment-309284271","id":309284271,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/9387","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTI4NDI3MQ==","updated_at":"2017-06-18T15:28:37.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/309284271","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/leewz\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/leewz\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/6633759?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/leewz","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/leewz\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/leewz","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/leewz\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzM3NTk=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/leewz\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/leewz\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/leewz\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"leewz","type":"User","id":6633759,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/leewz\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/leewz\/orgs"}}]}
