We've been iterating an app that generalizes how we create works with 3js for live and exhibition applications. It's basically an angular app that provides a UI for non-coders that generates a JSON file, and then another JS\/Express app that translates the JSON to 3js and binds sensor\/gamepad\/midi inputs to scene elements. We also use this app for the occasional adjunct teaching gig.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I recently built something that tried to add thousands of meshes to a scene had hit a hard limit, which led me to instancing. \r\n\r\nI've never used the node API, or really knew about it until you pointed it out.

The idea is similar to Houdini's, but strictly for generating shaders (and not geometry). Unity Shader Graph and Blender nodes are also good for comparison, among others.","created_at":"2018-10-02T17:45:04.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/15000#issuecomment-426366690","id":426366690,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/15000","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNjM2NjY5MA==","updated_at":"2018-10-02T17:45:04.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/426366690","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}}]}
