Great work to you and your team on the WebGL viewer!\n\nI have started working on a Ruby SketchUp extension that can export a SketchUp model to a ThreeJS JSON model file. I gave up trying to get SketchUp-exported .dae files to load with the seemingly unmaintained ThreeJS ColladaLoader (so many data-related errors in the parsing phase but it does work sometimes).\n\nCould you all please throw the source code for your 3D Warehouse WebGL viewer up on the @SketchUp Github account under a liberal open-source license? I will continue building my own ThreeJS-based viewer even if you don't but the entire SketchUp community will be at a loss if the only hackable viewer they have is mine.\n\nI would like my viewer to be able to...\n- Run files from my own site\n- Run animations that show how to assemble parts step-by-step\n- Pause during an animation to show nice explanatory text\n- Switch between classic SketchUp camera movement tools and an animation-managed camera\n- Load very quickly as a very minimalistic, no-interaction orbitting camera viewer with optional static explanatory text\n- Run without the 3D Warehouse logo since I don't plan to use it. The logo also looks ugly if I'm trying to build a site design with dozens of orbitting 3D assets on a page or if I wanted to embed a 3D asset at the top of a homepage near the site's logo.\n- Be easily extensible for other presentational or workflow-related customizations I may want to add in the future.\n\nHaving a viewer that is this hackable would be an awesome addition to the tools available to developers for bringing SketchUp assets into the modern WebGL era. \n\nRealistically, how likely do you think your team would be able to open-source it relatively soon? If you don't use the standard ThreeJS model format, would you be able to open-source your exporter too?\n\nThanks!\n","created_at":"2014-11-10T15:50:13.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/5077#issuecomment-62403694","id":62403694,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/5077","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNDAzNjk0","updated_at":"2014-11-10T15:52:33.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/62403694","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jicksta\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jicksta\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/155?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jicksta","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jicksta\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/jicksta","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jicksta\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jicksta\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jicksta\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jicksta\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"jicksta","type":"User","id":155,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jicksta\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jicksta\/orgs"}},{"index":17,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi @jicksta.
