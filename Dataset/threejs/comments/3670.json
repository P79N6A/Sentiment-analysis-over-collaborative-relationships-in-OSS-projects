Mainly because I wanted to know if this feature is wanted at all and for my use case works. I am generating some kind of steel plate with holes and bevel and the smoothing looks pretty good so that i am fine with it. The circle shape in the screenshot was just for showing the audience, so to say :) I am not sure if there is any kind of geometry edge case that would not work except of course for those geometries where an angle-weighted approach is not useful. What i can think of is deformed planeGeometries that i have not tested yet but i think they should smooth too as the user wants. \n\n> \"does the angle need to be selected intelligently\"\n\nDefinitely. It all depends on the bevelling parameters or whatever the user generated or what look he\/she wants to achieve. \n\n> also, do you have any links to reference on the approach you or others have implemented here?\n\nNo, unfortunately not. I found a gamedev-thread which i don't have at hand right now but the people all had some different ideas and I was just implementing a stupid straight forward approach which seems to work but is not quite tested and maybe has some edge case problems. I also posted here because I thought you guys would give me some input too about what you think how it can be done or done faster. \n\nI will search some more stuff, for example i found this one:\n\nhttp:\/\/docs.autodesk.com\/3DSMAX\/15\/ENU\/3ds-Max-SDK-Programmer-Guide\/index.html?url=files\/GUID-0FCB4578-77F8-4F05-99CD-349E85F13639.htm,topicNumber=d30e22921\n\nBut i did not have the time to go into more detail as the problem is not quite that easy after a second look. \nYou can divide the problem in two parts: \n\n1) One would have to check for faster ways (or shorter to program ways) to find adjacent faces\/edges. \n2) Maybe there is even a better way to generate those \"smoothing groups\".\n\nWell, I thought if mrDoob or others liked the feature, they would chime in or give tips about how to find and cache adjacent faces\/edges and so on but I am willing to do this, too!! Right now i am fine but i would love to shorten the code with some nice math and  javascript  magic and i would invest more time in finding papers on this problem!\n\n> lastly, if computeVertexNormals is replaced with your function, how much penalty in performance \n\nYes, it does a lot more calculus and you can't do this in the render loop but why wouldn't you at all. I measured around 30ms on an old core2 duo desktop CPU and for the first run a bit more ( i guess the browser does some caching here and there). Although i already changed the functions a bit and moved some variable declaration stuff outside of some loops which seemed to help improve performance. \n\nAnyway, as the area weighted averaging is taken from the now-used computeVertexNormals function, one could write a really short bypass via a boolean flag if no angle is provided for example and just iterate over all faces the way it is done now. Then, performance would be the same as it is now and the results are the same, too. \n","created_at":"2013-08-17T18:58:06.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/3670#issuecomment-22817587","id":22817587,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/3670","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyODE3NTg3","updated_at":"2013-08-17T18:59:02.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/22817587","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/GuyGood\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/GuyGood\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/3863078?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/GuyGood","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/GuyGood\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/GuyGood","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/GuyGood\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjMwNzg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/GuyGood\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/GuyGood\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/GuyGood\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"GuyGood","type":"User","id":3863078,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/GuyGood\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/GuyGood\/orgs"}},{"index":9,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I stumbled on this issue today, as I was looking to use the creaseAngle property from a VRML IndexedFaceSet to attain a smoothed curved surface.

It sounds cumbersome and smelly, as a workaround-more than solid design-to have to duplicate hard edges.\r\n\r\nFrom your older answers I understood that it should be enough to duplicate the hard edges. From your current answer, I understand that we need not only duplicate the edges, but also specify vertex normals. This would imply that simply calling `computeVertexNormals()` would not be sufficient, correct?\r\n\r\nSince in my project, I am loading legacy geometry from VRML files, I would have to compute the duplications and the normals, which should be possible once I fully understand the principles.","created_at":"2017-01-08T19:00:30.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/3670#issuecomment-271171172","id":271171172,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/3670","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTE3MTE3Mg==","updated_at":"2017-01-08T19:00:30.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/271171172","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bartmcleod\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bartmcleod\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1441397?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bartmcleod","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bartmcleod\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/bartmcleod","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bartmcleod\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDEzOTc=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bartmcleod\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bartmcleod\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bartmcleod\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"bartmcleod","type":"User","id":1441397,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bartmcleod\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bartmcleod\/orgs"}},{"index":12,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"For anyone who finds this with the same question: A small test shows that with duplicate edges, it works just fine when calling only `computeVertexNormals()` to generate the normals automatically.
