2[insert your currency].\r\n4 bones is a decent number for most types of skeleton, except maybe for facial rigs and here is why:\r\n- simple biped skeleton will have a branching factor of at most 4 (arm-spine-arm-neck, spine-hip-hip)\r\n- good skinning is quite important for a good animation result, so usually just throwing more bones doesn't yield a better result unless you skin well.\r\n- if skinning is done for 8 bones and you try to control it with 4 - you will get inaccurate results, but the degree of inaccuracy is actually controllable if you re-adjust weights for 4 bones, because losing 4 other bones will mean less overall influence on vertices unless the remaining 4 bones compensate.\r\n- Another problem with dropping bones is that you have to be smart about which ones you drop. Say you have 8 bones influencing finder joint: 3 phalanges,  palm, and through bad skinning another 4 phalanges of unrelated fingers with influence of 0. Say when we reduce number of bones from 8 to 4, we happen to pick those 4 unrelated phalanges - we end up with no motion at all. Selection of bones during reduction process matters, most influencing bones need to be selected.\r\n\r\nI would suggest looking into re-weighing the skin instead of adding more influencing bones as a first solution.","created_at":"2017-09-11T13:15:48.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12127#issuecomment-328525425","id":328525425,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12127","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODUyNTQyNQ==","updated_at":"2017-09-11T13:21:21.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/328525425","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/5939063?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Usnul","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzkwNjM=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Usnul","type":"User","id":5939063,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/orgs"}},{"index":5,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> I would suggest looking into re-weighing the skin instead of adding more influencing bones as a first solution.\r\n\r\nThank you for the feedback.
