As you have the `VRControls` transformations applied to the camera that moves the head and the hands from the center pivot, when you scale you're modifying both the controllers size but also the height of the user, making it small or big, but doing just that won't work as expected as you'll need to \"scale\" also the \"head\", it means scale your eye separation. \r\nIf instead of using `VREffect` for the camera we would have a `cameraVR` with two cameras inside it separated by the default IPD the scale of that `cameraVR` will result on scaling the separation between these two cameras that it's what we do on `VREffect` now.\r\nScaling the IPD is really what will modify, inversely proportional, the sense of the scene's scale.","created_at":"2017-01-27T09:23:18.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/10667#issuecomment-275622163","id":275622163,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10667","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTYyMjE2Mw==","updated_at":"2017-01-27T22:25:27.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/275622163","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fernandojsg\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fernandojsg\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/782511?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fernandojsg","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fernandojsg\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/fernandojsg","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fernandojsg\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MjUxMQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fernandojsg\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fernandojsg\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fernandojsg\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"fernandojsg","type":"User","id":782511,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fernandojsg\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fernandojsg\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"I assume this is to achieve stuff like world scaling inside Tilt Brush?
