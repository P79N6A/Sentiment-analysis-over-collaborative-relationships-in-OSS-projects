If you use that asset in multiple places, you only go to network once (if not in mem cache) and respond with it to multiple callbacks. There is also a built in mechanism that knows what assets need to be cloned per requester response or what data can be shared. E.g mesh asset give unique scene node to each requester but references the one geometry. We almost never use three.js to go to network (exception would be png\/jpeg loading, but we cache those internally too and not call load multiple times).\n\nBack in the day three.js did not have the Cache stuff discussed here so we built it on top of it. This cache layer is where I tried localForage about 6 months ago and the perf was not there for binary blobs, dunno if it has gotten better.\n\n**Edit:** If not anything else this sounds like good candidate for an external library :) Doing a simple cache is trivial but handling all the little things could be beneficial to wrap into a opinionated library.\n","created_at":"2016-04-22T19:07:18.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8693#issuecomment-213556705","id":213556705,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8693","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzU1NjcwNQ==","updated_at":"2016-04-22T19:10:17.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/213556705","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/157519?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/jonnenauha","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzUxOQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"jonnenauha","type":"User","id":157519,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/orgs"}},{"index":6,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"> For example we have our own asset system that goes to network only if it has not been fetched before, and caches the text\/binary responses.

You basically have two functions, write and read (cant remember the function names). I think the API was asynchronous in nature, so you provide callback functions that get invoked when the data is available. I think due to the different underlying APIs it cannot provide a synchronous API.\n\nIt did afaik support array buffers at least of the modern browsers, but at least when I tried it it was quite slow. Especially troubling was that it was inconsistent. Could take 200msec and the next page load takes 800ms for the same data, it was all over the place. I tried storing `THREE.BufferGeometry` attributes and loading them back, probably similar use case you have for mobile. You should check it out and see what the perf is like, browser implementation have probably improved since then.\n\nThe main utility of the library is the auto selection of the best technology per client. You get the same API no matter what is picked. This is pretty nice for app dev, but then again might give you problems when moving from desktop to PC or Chrome to Safari if the tech changes and the performance would then be different. I would suspect you need to test with actual target devices and browsers to get a real feel of the perf, and if you should just use network + parse instead.\n","created_at":"2016-04-23T14:31:17.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8693#issuecomment-213750436","id":213750436,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8693","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzc1MDQzNg==","updated_at":"2016-04-23T14:35:38.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/213750436","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/157519?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/jonnenauha","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzUxOQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"jonnenauha","type":"User","id":157519,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jonnenauha\/orgs"}}]}
