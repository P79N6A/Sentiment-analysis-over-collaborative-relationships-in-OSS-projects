To answer your questions:\n\n> I am not sure I understand how this control is intended to be used. Do you allow zooming and dollying?\n\nThe controls are intended to be used at first for basic spinning in the center of a scene. Later, I will add the possibility to move freely inside the level creation or scene.\n\n> What happens if the camera position is not at the origin?\n\nAt the moment if the camera is not at the origin, things get broken. The target need to be child of the camera. That will be improved\/updated too.\n\n> For me, the control seems to zoom in regardless of the scroll direction. (OS X, Chrome).\n\nI wasn't aware of that. I'll take a look at it.\n\n> Is an animation loop required? Compare with OrbitControls.\n\nI kept the animation loop to have the deceleration once the user stops interacting, for smoothness. It can be removed. \n\nI'll correct the naming you had pointed out, following orbit controls, to avoid confusions.\n","created_at":"2016-08-09T18:49:57.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/9476#issuecomment-238652842","id":238652842,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/9476","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzODY1Mjg0Mg==","updated_at":"2016-08-09T18:49:57.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/238652842","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/boyaquito\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/boyaquito\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1461271?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/boyaquito","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/boyaquito\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/boyaquito","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/boyaquito\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjEyNzE=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/boyaquito\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/boyaquito\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/boyaquito\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"boyaquito","type":"User","id":1461271,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/boyaquito\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/boyaquito\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Closing.
