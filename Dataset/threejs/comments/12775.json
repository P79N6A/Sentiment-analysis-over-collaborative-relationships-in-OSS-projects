It seemed to be causing the audio to get really \"crunchy\" which I thought might be related to the great number of connections even after setting their volume to 0. My attempts since reporting this bug, as I mentioned above, seemed to fixed the connections but not crunchiness from playing a lot of audio all at once (this was in chrome). I'm still investigating the cause of that, which I think is really just related to playing too many PositionalAudios at once.\r\n\r\nAnyway I'm trying to repro the behavior my test case showed in firefox, but for some reason in the Web Audio panel I'm only seeing \"Waiting for an audio context to be created...\" even though the sound is playing. I'll see if it working on my machine or someone else's to re-confirm what I was previously seeing.\r\n\r\nThanks for the prompt responses.","created_at":"2017-12-01T20:35:08.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12775#issuecomment-348607735","id":348607735,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12775","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0ODYwNzczNQ==","updated_at":"2017-12-01T20:38:40.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/348607735","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zynga-jpetersen\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zynga-jpetersen\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/13386409?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zynga-jpetersen","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zynga-jpetersen\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/zynga-jpetersen","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zynga-jpetersen\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzg2NDA5","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zynga-jpetersen\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zynga-jpetersen\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zynga-jpetersen\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"zynga-jpetersen","type":"User","id":13386409,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zynga-jpetersen\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zynga-jpetersen\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> Anyway I'm trying to repro the behavior my test case showed in firefox, but for some reason in the Web Audio panel I'm only seeing \"Waiting for an audio context to be created...\" even though the sound is playing.\r\n\r\nI guess FF can't identify the audio context when the application runs in an iframe.
