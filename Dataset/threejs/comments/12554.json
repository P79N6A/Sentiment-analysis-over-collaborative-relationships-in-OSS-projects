That's just a matter of adjusting the scene lighting, though... You can tweak knobs in the settings, or set up your own scene to make it as bright as you want.

MeshStandardMaterial tends to look better with that.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you can share the model this type conversation is often more productive. If you've only tested the model in my viewer, it might be better to [file an issue there](https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy\/three-gltf-viewer\/issues)... lighting is not dictated by GLTFLoader or three.js, it's up to the viewer application to choose that.\r\n\r\n@rck1 thanks, this sounds like it's worth looking into. If you have an example you can share, that would be helpful.","created_at":"2017-11-03T14:46:47.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12554#issuecomment-341724290","id":341724290,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12554","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTcyNDI5MA==","updated_at":"2017-11-03T14:46:47.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/341724290","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}},{"index":11,"author_association":"NONE","body":"@rck1 It works! @donmccurdy Your suggestion let me have a deeper understanding of the GLTFloader, Thank you very much!","created_at":"2017-11-06T06:49:50.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12554#issuecomment-342060892","id":342060892,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12554","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MjA2MDg5Mg==","updated_at":"2017-11-06T06:49:50.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/342060892","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Maplesog\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Maplesog\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/18155748?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Maplesog","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Maplesog\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Maplesog","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Maplesog\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTU1NzQ4","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Maplesog\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Maplesog\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Maplesog\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Maplesog","type":"User","id":18155748,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Maplesog\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Maplesog\/orgs"}},{"index":12,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Reopening this, as I do think there may be an issue.
