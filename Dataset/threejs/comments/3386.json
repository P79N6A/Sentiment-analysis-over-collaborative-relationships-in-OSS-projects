It is not checked that other points of the hole are \u2018in\u2019 the chopping area. For example: take a square polygon (only 4 points on the corner) and a circular hole in it with lots of points, near one of the corners of the square. The choping \u2018area\u2019 is quite big as it will span one side of of the square and will include multiple points of the circle. In this is case, looking for the shorest connection is not enough. A possible candicate connection must be checked on intersection with other points.\n\nA second problem: say I have two holes, hole 1 and hole 2. Hole 2 is in the path of the shortest connection between hole 1 and the polygon\u2026\"\n\nFor me this sounds a possible candicate for this failure.

This is especially useful as a pre-triangulation step. As far as I understand the user in the question tried to use only Polygons structure and tried to manually find which hole belongs to which contour.\n\nRegarding to weakly simple polygons: They can be handled at least in making first sure that input polygons are made at least weakly simple and then making a \"broken pen nib\" effect, which is fast because duplicateness comparing can be made using key checking and after that only duplicates are needed to be processed (one sqrt to find a nib point along previous edge and other sqrt to find a nib point along the next edge.

The default works reasonably well without holes, but holes causes so much possiblities for failures that it is not the best option for general polygon triangulator.\n\nAll tests with complex polygons with complex contour-hole structures have succeeded so far in poly2tri. But I have not yet tested it with thousands of different polygons to be able to say that it's stability is in production state.\n\nTaking into account that those thousands are not yet tested, for now I can say that Clipper + poly2tri works well together. The \"nibbing\" technique seems to work reliably, if polygons are cleaned using Clipper's CleanPolygon function which removes (combines into one vertice) too near adjacent vertices (eg. within 0.1 units \\* scale). After this polygons have to be Simplified (Unioned) using Clipper's Simplify function to remove self-intersections and combine common edges and make polygons weakly-simple which are simple in all other means but regarding semi-adjacent duplicates. The Clipper's CleanPolygon() makes a safe circular region around each vertice inside which we can move semi-adjacent and cross-polygon duplicate points to achieve the \"broken pen nib\" effect. If vertices are Cleaned using eg. 0.1 units, then eg. 0.01 units \"nibbing\" is safe to do. And after this the triangulation works without issues. Sounds a bit complicated, but it actually can be achieved using only few lines of code.\n\nThe dependency issue is still left. Poly2tri:s update cycle is rather frequent, and it would be nice to make it easy to use the newest version if wanted. One possibility would be to include some stable version in Three.js (eg. the one that I have tested seems to be such), which is not updated before there is a good reason for it (eg. speed, stability or bug-fix). But Three.js is rather big library, and adding one more thousand rows is a decision that have to be made after serious thinking.\n\nI'm not yet sure in which side the \"broken-pen-nib\" should be done. CleanPolygon (=RemoveTooNearVertices) is about 60 lines of code and BreakPenNibs() is about 200 lines, but because Removing too near vertices can cause minor self-intersections the order is this: clean, union, breaknibs. This means that it may be not wise to implement \"nibbing\" in Three.js, because then the union feature should be there also which means 2000-6000 lines of Clipper code. So as a conclusion of this paragraph: if user first makes cleaning and unioning using Clipper, it makes output weakly-simple (= have semi-adjacent duplicates). If \"nibbing\" is inside Three.js, it means that Three.js can accept weakly-simple polygons as input making it more permissive and usable as such. But because user can have made the \"nibbing\" beforehand, it is waste of resources to make it again. To prevent this the \"nibbing\" can be made optional using some parameter. 200 lines of code is not much and the algorithm is fast.\n\nBut this doesn't solve the bad designed fonts, that have self-intersections, but I assume that this is a font creator side problem to make font outlines to be simple. Fonts can have curves, and these have to be converted to polygons before extruding and this polygonization can cause also self-intersections in some cases, so the fonts that are used in Three.js should be polygonized fonts as far as I can understand. Or how they are handled now?\n","created_at":"2013-04-29T08:35:03.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/3386#issuecomment-17155162","id":17155162,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/3386","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTU1MTYy","updated_at":"2013-04-29T09:51:28.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/17155162","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/2405021?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/timo22345","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDUwMjE=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"timo22345","type":"User","id":2405021,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/orgs"}},{"index":28,"author_association":"NONE","body":"@obidobi In the previous post I described a possible scenario regarding Three.js and poly2tri: adding it as a default triangulator seems to be wise and after tests with thousands of complex polygons I can say this more sure :)\n\nThanks for adding a link to JS Clipper. I'm soon updating the exPolygons bug, so after it the Clipper is more usable as a pre-triangulation step, because it then can provide you the desired contour-hole relationships with only a little overhead. Also some performance issues have to be fixed. Eg. now it uses big integers also in some cases where it is not needed and it slows down the performance a lot: nearly 30% in FF19. Also point creating is now achieved using very slow var IntPoint = function(x,y){this.X=x,this.Y=y}. The more faster at least in FF19 is to use var IntPoint = function(x,y){return {X:x, Y:y}}. Also many of the push commands can be converted to assignments and using preallocated arrays is also significantly faster. Also I'm considering to implement Web Workers in some of the most heavy calculations (eg. finding intersections) in cases where there are huge amount of vertices. And couple of fixes have to be done to make Clipper itself Web Worker ready (but this is a really minor fix). But the first priority is the exPolygons bug fix and some helper functions regarding exPolygons. These are details of my side, but these findings can of course help others also to make code more efficient.\n","created_at":"2013-04-29T09:04:33.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/3386#issuecomment-17156225","id":17156225,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/3386","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3MTU2MjI1","updated_at":"2013-04-29T09:51:51.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/17156225","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/2405021?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/timo22345","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDUwMjE=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"timo22345","type":"User","id":2405021,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/timo22345\/orgs"}},{"index":29,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Here is another rather complex example of Clipper + Poly2tri + Three.js.
