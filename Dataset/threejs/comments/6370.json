The new works more like textures do, ish.\n\nWhole compiled program with same parameters _does not exist_\n\n##### Current Logic\n1. Create and Compile vertex shader on GPU\n2. Check results (wait for completion)\n   - Output Errors if occurred\n3. Create and Compile fragment shader on GPU\n4. Check results (wait for completion)\n   - Output Errors if occurred\n5. Create and Link program on GPU \n6. Check results (wait for completion)\n   - Output Errors if occurred\n7. Query uniform and attribute locations.\n8. Return program\n   - Output continuous errors if error occurred\n9. Render object\n\n##### New Logic\n1. Check if matching vertex shader exists in cache\n   - Use if does\n   - If not create on GPU and submit for compile, mark as compiling, add to cache\n2. Check if matching fragment shader exists\n   - Use if does\n   - If not create on GPU and submit for compile, mark as compiling, add to cache\n3. Check if shaders are pre-compiled (from cache), if so move to (7. Link step), if from cache but not compiled move to (5. Check results), else return WebGLProgram reference then:\n4. Skip object render -> new frame or next object using same shaders\n5. Check vertex shader results (wait for completion)\n   - Output Errors if occurred, mark shader as errored, mark program as errored\n   - Else mark as compiled\n6. Check fragment shader results (wait for completion)\n   - Output Errors if occurred, mark shader as errored, mark program as errored\n   - Else mark as compiled\n7. (Link step) Create program on GPU, submit for linking, mark program as Linking\n8. Skip object render -> new frame or next object using same program\n9. Check Link results (wait for completion)\n   - Output Errors if occurred, mark program as errored\n   - Else mark as linked\n10. Query uniform and attribute locations.\n11. Render object\n\nWith the new logic it can take 3 attempts at using the program for it to be ready (either 3 objects using same shaders or 3rd frame); but the old logic will instead block other js from running while it waits.\n\nThe new logic also caches the shader parts (vertex+fragment); so if you have 15 different programs but the vertex shader is the same in all of them it only is compiled once and that step is skipped for the other 14 programs; whereas previously it would be compiled 15 times.\n\nError handling is different and both errored shaders and programs are cached and marked as errorred; so if something else uses them it doesn't try to do anything with them as they are immediately identified as errored; with the error being previously reported. \n\nProbably not very clear, but hope it makes some sense?\n","created_at":"2015-04-14T08:33:02.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/6370#issuecomment-92694256","id":92694256,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6370","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkyNjk0MjU2","updated_at":"2015-04-14T08:33:02.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/92694256","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1142958?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/benaadams","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDI5NTg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"benaadams","type":"User","id":1142958,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/orgs"}},{"index":9,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@bhouston specificly in code it is here: https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/6370\/files#diff-5e43a0b5002eb2c419def3baf67d4e67R31\n","created_at":"2015-04-14T08:36:20.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/6370#issuecomment-92695264","id":92695264,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6370","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkyNjk1MjY0","updated_at":"2015-04-14T08:36:20.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/92695264","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1142958?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/benaadams","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDI5NTg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"benaadams","type":"User","id":1142958,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/orgs"}},{"index":10,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"A test which shows this is the webgl_test_memory2 (http:\/\/prealpha.ageofascent.com\/examples\/webgl_test_memory2.html) which now outputs more information to the console:\n\n###### Chrome (Version 41.0.2272.118 m)\n\n1: compile submit  -
