Unfortunately this format does not provide enough information required for me to create a generic exporter for 3D Max.\nWhat I'm trying to do is to make a very easy to use exporter where you only have 1 window in 3D max and this will automatically export the entire scene, and give the user access to all the exported parts using their original name from 3D Max.\nSo far I managed to create 3 categories of objects (geometry, lights, cameras). All of these objects can have animated key-frames,and the geometry can be also morphed. One of the most important thing that I need in order to be able to export all the geometry's animation properly is the pivot point and I noticed there isn't any option to export this.\nI still have a lot work to do.

At least from my experiments so far I've found OpenCollada doesn't suffer these rotation issues and I hacked it's loader to read std phong mats as TJS PBR to make the process a little easier.
