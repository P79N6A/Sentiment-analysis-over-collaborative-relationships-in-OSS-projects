You should create just one and reuse it.\r\n\r\nI wanted to have them be different sizes _and_ have differing amounts of animated scale, so it was easy to do it this way (without thinking much about it, because the API lends to it being easy that way).\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like is a scene graph that has both size and scale, decoupled from each other, like DOM+CSS.\r\n\r\nI see how this can be done with Three.js' scene graph, with some book keeping on top of it. But it's not as ideal as DOM+CSS where `width`\/`height` is decoupled and separate from `transform:scale()` without me having to write a layer on top of the DOM+CSS in order to have both separate size and scale.\r\n\r\nThere's much good stuff to learn from DOM. F.e., imagine, various \"people\" in a game, they are different heights, and all have a scale of `1`. Then, they all take some mushrooms, and now their scales start wobbling, but their size numbers haven't changed. (weird example, but valid!). It can be done in Three, but the layer of numbers (size + scale) has to be implemented on top of Three.\r\n\r\nIn my lib, I will create a non-coupled concept of scale + size, and under the hood, yes, I will re-use geometries.","created_at":"2018-05-01T03:46:37.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/2916#issuecomment-385592629","id":385592629,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/2916","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTU5MjYyOQ==","updated_at":"2018-05-01T03:46:37.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/385592629","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/297678?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/trusktr","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzY3OA==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"trusktr","type":"User","id":297678,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/orgs"}},{"index":24,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> There is no way the renderer could optimise your code.\r\n\r\nSomething like https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/10093 may help!
