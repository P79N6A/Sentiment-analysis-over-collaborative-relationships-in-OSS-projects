I'm not really a serious graphics or JS programmer, but with a pointer in the right direction, I think I could take a shot at this.\r\n\r\nFrom some [cursory reading](https:\/\/www.sjbaker.org\/steve\/omniv\/alpha_sorting.html), it seems like the depth buffer doesn't contribute much to the correct rendering of (correctly sorted) transparent objects. \r\n\r\nSo if transparent objects by default didn't write into the depth buffer (or maybe the depth buffer got restored to the state it was in after rendering all the opaques after the transparents are done), that shouldn't break much, right?\r\n\r\nThen the sprite \"pass\" would just render over any transparent objects, but not solid ones. Looks like that's what OGRE does, too \u2013 at least the way it's used in RViz (see the second screenshot in https:\/\/github.com\/RobotWebTools\/ros3djs\/issues\/192 ).\r\n\r\nFeels a little closer to \"right\" to me than what's happening now. Then, to get 100% correct results, I guess you'd have to sort sprites and objects together and switch renderers potentially every other object, which looks like a lot of work and possibly wasted performance...","created_at":"2017-12-16T15:41:19.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6396#issuecomment-352191015","id":352191015,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6396","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MjE5MTAxNQ==","updated_at":"2017-12-16T15:41:19.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/352191015","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/T045T\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/T045T\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/871405?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/T045T","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/T045T\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/T045T","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/T045T\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MTQwNQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/T045T\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/T045T\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/T045T\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"T045T","type":"User","id":871405,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/T045T\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/T045T\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"OWNER","body":">
