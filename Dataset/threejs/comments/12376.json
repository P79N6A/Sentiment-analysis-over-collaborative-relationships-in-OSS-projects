This kind of pre-processing should not be necessary if you properly export animations from a content creation tool like Blender.\r\n\r\nTry to isolate the issue into a small test case and post a question at stackoverflow.

Actually the JSON Loader parses the SRT animation to the top level. Say object.animations and the (correct) morph tracks to object.child.geometry.animations. And then on top of all that to reduce filesize I am cloning things. So I think I kinda have to reparse the animations in a library. \r\n\r\nIf the bindings would be wrong though, howcome it would make the clones disappear? \r\n\r\nThanks for the two suggestions I will have a look at those. The intro to the Animation system is what I used to refactor this code. And actually in a previous release, the SRT animation worked fine. Makes me wonder if it has something to do with dropping the scene hierarchy (scene:object:action.track for ex.). Actually, no I think not.\r\n\r\nPS. I realise the fiddle is way too complex. Not sure how I can simplify though. I need to set up the scene, load a json makes clones and link up the animations.

Making the initial scaling values come out super tiny. Then the scale track had values of one (correctly in my view), so as soon as animation started the model just blew up out of view (and didnt actually vanish). I see from the other bug reports that it is probably related to checking or unchecking \"scene\", which needs to be checked in my case but then also writes the wrong matrix transformation in your object. \r\n\r\nMoreover it is really hard to see because the the Object contains no initial scaling values but a matrix transform that leads to this erroneous scaling value.\r\n\r\nShame that the initial response is then to quickly dismiss, ie you are doing it wrong (and didn't you work on many of these referenced bugs?).\r\n\r\nOh and on top of that the animation object is also written all wrong by the exporter. It just lobs all tracks in one \"animations\" object. That should be tracks collected in a clip. As you can see in my edited json in my fiddle. I edited the animations object animations > 0 > tracks, 1 > tracks, 2 tracks etc. Which is the exporter and not me exporting it incorrectly. \r\n\r\nBut but, at least I can get things to work now.
