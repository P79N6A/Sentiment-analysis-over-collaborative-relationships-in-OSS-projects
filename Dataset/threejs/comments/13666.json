Describe current behavior of setFilter and setFilters, and the .filters array.  This will have some odd text, since the setFilter* methods are kind of odd.

This is pretty open-ended; I expect you'd really want to have a setFilter that took an offset, and setFilters shouldn't exist.\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure?
