I flipped it back to visible, and it worked.\n\nSo your diagnosis was right : it has some problems trying to ignore invisible objects. \n\nI mentioned the modifiers because it already happened a few times that I received error because of them. If for example you launch the export when you are in edit mode instead than in object mode, and you have modifiers, it will give error saying that it can't apply the modifier while in edit mode. In this case, some times I found the \"triangulate\" modifier set on a number of meshes. I suppose, but have no knowledge of the code and I'm not a blender expert, that the triangulate modifier is used during export to reduce all the faces into triangles, and should be then cleaned-up when the export is done, but if it goes in error in that part it does not cleanup.\n\nThanks for pointing me in the right direction!\n","created_at":"2015-03-23T13:18:32.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6276#issuecomment-84993951","id":84993951,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6276","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0OTkzOTUx","updated_at":"2015-03-23T13:18:32.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/84993951","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SimoneGianni\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SimoneGianni\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1228713?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SimoneGianni","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SimoneGianni\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/SimoneGianni","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SimoneGianni\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjg3MTM=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SimoneGianni\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SimoneGianni\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SimoneGianni\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"SimoneGianni","type":"User","id":1228713,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SimoneGianni\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/SimoneGianni\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I will have to double check because invisible objects should be skipped so this shouldn't have been an issue.\n\nThe exporter only goes into EDIT mode to recalculate normals and this is only on a temporary mesh.
