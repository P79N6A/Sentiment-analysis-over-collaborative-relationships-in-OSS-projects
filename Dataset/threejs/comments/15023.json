And practically if beginners come across ES6 modules at all, they are going to see example code using the npm package in the same way, so the proposed syntax would be more consistent with:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { AnimationClip, AnimationUtils, ... } from 'three';\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in any case, that's a great idea on setting up the dev environment to do this. I checked and sure enough there's a VSCode extension that autocompletes imports and it works here.
