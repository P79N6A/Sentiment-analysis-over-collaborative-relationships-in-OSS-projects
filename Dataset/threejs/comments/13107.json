Is there a version with the fix you're mentioning?  (If so I'm very curious what the solution was and where I can get it).  The ThreeJS ggx code looks to be a direct copy from UE4's white paper on an optimized version of the ggx function for mobile.  But the issue seems to ripple out from that roughness value, as it seems more correct using the sqrt of the roughness value for both the ggx function AND the cube uv index;  I am finding that if I perturb the input roughness in the bsdfs BRDF specular ggx env && cube_uv_reflection_fragment textureCubeUV by pow(roughness,0.5), it evens out the roughness curve near the specularly blown out ranges (lower roughness) and helps smooth out the final result as if the surface texels are actually smoother near the lower range values (high specularity).  To me, this is very similar to an internal change in the ggx and\/or cube uv roughness index value algorithms, as it should influence the final result in the same way.  Anyone have thoughts on this?  It sort of begs the question, to me, what is UE4's explanation for squaring the roughness on input (see BRDF_Specular_GGX and reference in bsdfs.glsl), which is the exact opposite of what I'm doing here.","created_at":"2018-12-18T21:33:16.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/13107#issuecomment-448378449","id":448378449,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/13107","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0ODM3ODQ0OQ==","updated_at":"2018-12-18T21:33:16.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/448378449","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RyanFavale\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RyanFavale\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/7751972?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RyanFavale","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RyanFavale\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/RyanFavale","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RyanFavale\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NTE5NzI=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RyanFavale\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RyanFavale\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RyanFavale\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"RyanFavale","type":"User","id":7751972,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RyanFavale\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RyanFavale\/orgs"}},{"index":27,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> the smooth metallic values are a bit off (too high too fast)\r\n\r\n@RyanFavale compared to what tools or renderers?
