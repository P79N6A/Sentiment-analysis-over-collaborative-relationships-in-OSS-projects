It's true that you can load DDS textures, but you can't do so with say JSON loader which comes bundled with core, at least not without hacks. Lets say I load a png texture, but I want to re-compress it into something that GPU would be able to work with - right now your options are limited to off-line conversion only. And tools like crunch are great, but you have to know about them, and their usability is quite restricted.

It's quite impressive for what it is, I especially liked the foliage, it looks really awesome. But at the same time it demonstrates a very limited set of features. Just as an example, my own engine sports some 40-odd systems; to name some features:\r\nsound, animation, path finding, compressing, spatial index (BVH and r-tree), visibility sets, particle engine, physics, heads-up-displays, tiled terrain, foliage, montecarlo AI core, concurrency engine, serialization\/deserialization, asset management\r\n\r\nproblem is - to have a competent game engine, it requires bringing a lot of knowledge from fairly disparate domains together. In game engine literature \"ECS\" is often given as an example of game engine architecture - i feel it is misleading, since ECS only covers one aspect of what makes a game engine - the simulation.\r\n\r\nIn modern games usually you end up with a lot of so-called \"middleware\" components, each of which handles a specific task, and does so very well. Like sound(e.g. wwise), path finding (e.g. PathEngine), occlusion (e.g. Umbra), LOD (simplygon) etc. I'm not sure if this is just a trend, or an evolution of the industry. Game engines such as Unity or Unreal come with a ready bag of well integrated tools that cover a lot of concerns, but often they can't compete with highly specialized middleware providers, due to accumulated knowledge, patents, required effort etc.","created_at":"2018-04-17T10:23:43.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/13807#issuecomment-381937864","id":381937864,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/13807","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MTkzNzg2NA==","updated_at":"2018-04-17T10:25:17.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/381937864","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/5939063?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Usnul","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MzkwNjM=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Usnul","type":"User","id":5939063,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Usnul\/orgs"}},{"index":12,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Just FYI \u2014 no problem with having a holistic initial conversation here if it's helpful to set direction, but I am not planning to give any specific feedback in this thread.

If you\u2019re using three.js as a game engine, you will want to make opinionated choices about which physics engine to use, which materials and effects to allow, how to manage state, how large the build can be, and more. We do not make those choices for you, but consequently we also can\u2019t provide an all-in-one game engine. Unity or BabylonJS are good products for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThat doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t spend time on game-related things; we do. But some features require opinionated choices about how apps are built and should be done on top of, not within, three.js. I hope it's clear that I'm not trying to devalue the suggestions in this thread \u2014 many of them are totally reasonable requests given three.js's scope. But it is complicated, and I don't think we can reach a decision in a single thread.","created_at":"2018-04-18T18:38:06.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/13807#issuecomment-382487330","id":382487330,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/13807","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MjQ4NzMzMA==","updated_at":"2018-04-18T18:38:06.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/382487330","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}},{"index":16,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@donmccurdy Thank you for that.
