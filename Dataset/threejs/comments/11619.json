So that makes it tricky and confusing if you want to render the HMD's view to the screen.\r\n\r\nSo let's say the camera's parent is at (0, 0, 0) and the user's head is at 1.6m. You do a VR stereo render pass, and `WebVRManager` applies the standing matrix (i.e. moves 1.6m up) putting the view in the right place. Then you draw to the screen, but the standing matrix is no longer applied, so the view is rendered from the floor.\r\n\r\nSure, it's possible to write a workaround by transforming the camera for the render pass and then transforming it back. But that's extremely difficult to reason about, easy to get wrong and probably not very efficient.","created_at":"2017-07-25T17:45:08.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11619#issuecomment-317814761","id":317814761,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11619","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzgxNDc2MQ==","updated_at":"2017-07-25T17:45:08.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/317814761","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brianchirls\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brianchirls\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/492291?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brianchirls","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brianchirls\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/brianchirls","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brianchirls\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjI5MQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brianchirls\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brianchirls\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brianchirls\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"brianchirls","type":"User","id":492291,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brianchirls\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brianchirls\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"In my case I try to change the camera position around the scene (for teleport it purposes, for example) but always is rendered on 0,0,0, and you need to add the camera as a child of an object3D in the scene with your desired height to works as expected.
