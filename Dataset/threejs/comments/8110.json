It's a serious flaw and they have treated it with full contempt. 2D canvas drawing is also affecting. \n\nI have created a ticket with Apple directly because an issue with webkit has been sitting there since July 2014 unassigned. WebGL video is basically useless on IOS and Safari until then. But then Iphone playing inline video is also required. \n\nI believe filing duplicates with Apple might help them hurry it up. \n\nPlease see these. I have almost finished getting video textures and 360 video working fully on Android, Chrome Dev has only just fixed rendering issues I had to work tirelessly with chromium on that. There is now video playback performance issues with Chrome. \n\nI'm now onto this mess with Safari !\n\nThis is a radar of the actual apple ticket with the issue word for word\n\nhttps:\/\/openradar.appspot.com\/24641824\n\nhttps:\/\/forums.developer.apple.com\/message\/113161#113161\n\nThe actual webkit issue.
