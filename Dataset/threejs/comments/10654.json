It might be useful for testing I'm doing for my team.\r\n\r\nDetails: I've been doing testing for my team's (http:\/\/simtable.com\/) use of Three. It is a simulation system with many thousands of \"agents\" (or \"turtles\" in NetLogo). The testing uses dat.gui to go up to 100K agents.\r\n\r\nThus far I've used a mesh-per-agent (resulting in a draw per agent), Points (one per agent, 1 draw), BufferGeometry (1 draw for all similar agents), and ShaderMaterial (like BufferGeometry but with the option to do transforms in the gpu rather than the cpu). All tests on Chrome or Canary latest.\r\n\r\n- mesh-per-agent was too slow for most use (>1500 agents) \r\n- Points (THREE.PointsMaterial\/Points) were amazingly fast, but billboarding might be an issue.\r\n- BufferGeometry was quite fast after profiling in Chrome got rid of chrome-optimization issues. Basically triangles, arrows, and squares (for eventual texturing) all got 60fps with 100K agents\r\n- ShaderMaterial is great for using the gpu for more of the computations\r\n\r\nAll but the last is standard enough to be easily understood as \"vanilla\" Three by the team, I think.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I'm still pursuing all four strategies, but BufferGeometry is the current favorite. I have to test the rest of the standard attributes (color, uv, etc). Basically simplicity is a big deal.\r\n\r\nSo with all that, is it near-trivial for me to test #10093? I assume I'd use my mesh-per-agent test, but with your Three branch, right?","created_at":"2017-02-08T18:15:59.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10654#issuecomment-278414747","id":278414747,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10654","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODQxNDc0Nw==","updated_at":"2017-02-08T18:18:56.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/278414747","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/backspaces\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/backspaces\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/124366?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/backspaces","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/backspaces\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/backspaces","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/backspaces\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDM2Ng==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/backspaces\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/backspaces\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/backspaces\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"backspaces","type":"User","id":124366,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/backspaces\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/backspaces\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@backspaces I've prebuilt it, so you can just drop it in:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/Benjamin-Dobell\/three.js\/instancing-builds\/build\/three.js\r\n\r\nor the minified version:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/Benjamin-Dobell\/three.js\/instancing-builds\/build\/three.min.js\r\n\r\nor if you're using npm:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install Benjamin-Dobell\/three.js#instancing-builds\r\n```\r\n\r\nA mesh per agent sounds right to me, the mesh can be backed by either `BufferGeometry` or `Geometry`, ideally the former, but they both work.","created_at":"2017-02-08T20:26:58.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10654#issuecomment-278451246","id":278451246,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10654","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3ODQ1MTI0Ng==","updated_at":"2017-02-08T20:27:37.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/278451246","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/482276?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Benjamin-Dobell","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MjI3Ng==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Benjamin-Dobell","type":"User","id":482276,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"NONE","body":"@Benjamin-Dobell @mrdoob Hi, thanks for the help.\r\n\r\nIt's possible my test environment is odd: es6, use of a util lib, and import\/export for modules.
