For example, a point (1,1,0) after along X-axis translation (1,0,0) is (2,1,0); a vector (1,1,0) after along X-axis translation (1,0,0) is still (1,1,0). So if a programmer use \"Vector3.applyMatrix4( matrix )\" to transform a \"Vector\", then he will be wrong. Many programmers will be surprised by this.\n\nSeveral books discussed this issue and support to separate the classes. One example is 'Introduction to Geometric Computing' (http:\/\/dl.acm.org\/citation.cfm?id=1394392). Chapter 3 and chapter 4 in that book discussed this issue. The arguments include: The behaviors of transforming a point and a vector are different. \"Adding two points\" doesn't make sense. etc.\n\nIn my opinion, the high-level library's goal is to make the API intuitive and close to the real problem domain, rather than to stick to the low-level implementation details. For instance, when we write a high-level \"var foo = Math.sin(30);\", we don't care how the CPU do the addition and multiplication internally. We have vec4 and vec3, how many people can explain EXACTLY what's the difference between vec4\/vec3? It's not good for the newbie programmers and even for many experienced programmers.\n\nTo conclude, the reason to separate classes of point and vector is that vector and point are different concepts mathematically. It could be easier for the programmers to avoid the pitfalls.\n","created_at":"2014-06-24T03:39:53.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/4969#issuecomment-46928924","id":46928924,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/4969","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTI4OTI0","updated_at":"2014-06-24T11:40:13.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/46928924","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mo1999\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mo1999\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/6595591?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mo1999","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mo1999\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mo1999","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mo1999\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTU1OTE=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mo1999\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mo1999\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mo1999\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Mo1999","type":"User","id":6595591,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mo1999\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mo1999\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> So if a programmer use \"Vector3.applyMatrix4( matrix )\" to transform a \"Vector\", then he will be wrong.\n\nUse `Vector3.transformDirection( matrix )`.\n","created_at":"2014-06-24T14:02:17.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/4969#issuecomment-46974300","id":46974300,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/4969","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTc0MzAw","updated_at":"2014-06-24T14:02:17.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/46974300","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1000017?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/WestLangley","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDAwMTc=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"WestLangley","type":"User","id":1000017,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"NONE","body":"> Use Vector3.transformDirection( matrix )\n\nThere are many ways to transform a vector.
