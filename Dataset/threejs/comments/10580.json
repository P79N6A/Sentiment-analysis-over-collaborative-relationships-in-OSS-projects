However, I'm not sure how ColladaLoader2 looks for textures (as all path linkages are gone after unzipping).\r\n\r\nThe way I see the problems:\r\n\r\n1. Upon unzipping, you have to guesstimate the folder structure. You can just scan the zip looking for .DAE files however\r\n2. Where does the DAE attempt to look for textures? Is it possible to override where it's looking, and simply build a lookup table for the textures that we've unzipped?\r\n3. Since zip is essentially a folder, it's necessary for this feature to load multiple models (and possibly multiple types of model formats).\r\n\r\nFinally, the unzip and collada-parsing is quite slow.
