I deleted a previous version of this comment as there was an error in my code. \r\n\r\n@WestLangley I implemented your suggestion to invert winding order for the geometry of meshes whose `.matrixWorld` determinant is negative, and it seems to work.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nobject.traverse( ( child ) => {\r\n\r\n  if ( child instanceof THREE.Mesh ) {\r\n\r\n    if ( child.matrixWorld.determinant() < 0 ) {\r\n\r\n      const geom = new THREE.Geometry().fromBufferGeometry( child.geometry );\r\n\r\n      for ( let i = 0; i < geom.faces.length; i++ ) {\r\n\r\n        const face = geom.faces[i];\r\n\r\n        const tempA = face.a;\r\n\r\n        face.a = face.c;\r\n        face.c = tempA;\r\n\r\n        child.geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry().fromGeometry( geom );\r\n\r\n\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe results look pretty good, but there are a couple of issues - the first is that is's sloowww - around 26 seconds for the robot mesh. \r\n\r\nSecond is that it breaks smoothing. \r\n\r\n![foot](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/5307958\/29167665-87238744-7df5-11e7-8d1f-8ea8235e648a.jpg)\r\n\r\nI've tried fixing this by running `.computeVertexNormals()` and \/ or `.computeFaceNormals()` on the intermediate geometry.  `.computeVertexNormals()` actually re-inverts the geometry (although unfortunately running it on it's own without reversing the winding order doesn't fix things).

The right foot is mirrored and displays inverted when loaded in three.js. If I apply a reset xform modifier to it nothing happens ( the pivot is still inverted). \r\n\r\n![pre_scale](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/5307958\/29200776-514c44a2-7e82-11e7-9988-dade5f45bec6.jpg)\r\n\r\nNext, I negatively scale it in the x-axis. The pivots are now equal. \r\n\r\n![post_scale](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/5307958\/29200817-b828d9d8-7e82-11e7-9474-1fb9c98960e7.jpg)\r\n\r\nFinally I apply an x-form modifier to the right foot again, and the pivots are back in their initial (mirrored) state\r\n\r\n![pre_scale](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/5307958\/29200835-e6783f22-7e82-11e7-97b7-60eb2c87830e.jpg)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately negatively scaling in Max isn't a direct solution as the foot loaded in three.js now displays upside down\r\n\r\n![three_post_scale](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/5307958\/29200922-9e167b6c-7e83-11e7-991c-f26b31227e96.jpg)\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-11T03:56:15.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11911#issuecomment-321727472","id":321727472,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11911","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTcyNzQ3Mg==","updated_at":"2017-08-11T03:56:59.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/321727472","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/5307958?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/looeee","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDc5NTg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"looeee","type":"User","id":5307958,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/orgs"}},{"index":22,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"OK, here is the fixed reverse winding order function:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nobject.traverse( ( child ) => {\r\n\r\n  if ( child instanceof THREE.Mesh ) {\r\n\r\n    if ( child.matrixWorld.determinant() < 0 ) {\r\n\r\n      const l = child.geometry.attributes.position.array.length;\r\n\r\n      const positions = child.geometry.attributes.position.array;\r\n      const normals = child.geometry.attributes.normal.array;\r\n\r\n      for ( let i = 0; i < l; i += 9 ) {\r\n\r\n        \/\/ reverse winding order\r\n        const tempX = positions[ i + 0 ];\r\n        const tempY = positions[ i + 1 ];\r\n        const tempZ = positions[ i + 2 ];\r\n\r\n        positions[ i + 0 ] = positions[ i + 6 ];\r\n        positions[ i + 1 ] = positions[ i + 7 ];\r\n        positions[ i + 2 ] = positions[ i + 8 ];\r\n\r\n        positions[ i + 6 ] = tempX;\r\n        positions[ i + 7 ] = tempY;\r\n        positions[ i + 8 ] = tempZ;\r\n\r\n        \/\/ switch vertex normals\r\n        const tempNX = normals[ i + 0 ];\r\n        const tempNY = normals[ i + 1 ];\r\n        const tempNZ = normals[ i + 2 ];\r\n\r\n        normals[ i + 0 ] = normals[ i + 6 ];\r\n        normals[ i + 1 ] = normals[ i + 7 ];\r\n        normals[ i + 2 ] = normals[ i + 8 ];\r\n\r\n        normals[ i + 6 ] = tempNX;\r\n        normals[ i + 7 ] = tempNY;\r\n        normals[ i + 8 ] = tempNZ;\r\n\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n} );\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's very fast (14ms on the robot model), and looks correct.

I'm not sure that this will be an issue as I don't think FBX exports skeletons anyway, and the only way I can get animations to play correctly (with any loader, not just three.js) is to bake and re-sample all animations on export. But nonetheless that will need to be tested before considering adding this to the loader.\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-11T04:35:17.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11911#issuecomment-321730402","id":321730402,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11911","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMTczMDQwMg==","updated_at":"2017-08-11T20:11:41.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/321730402","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/5307958?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/looeee","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMDc5NTg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"looeee","type":"User","id":5307958,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/looeee\/orgs"}},{"index":23,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">
