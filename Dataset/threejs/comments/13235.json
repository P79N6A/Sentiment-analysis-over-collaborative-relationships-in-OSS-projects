I used [this CSG lib](https:\/\/github.com\/chandlerprall\/ThreeCSG) which works good in browsers' main thread. When I used it in a WebWorker I got many stackoverflow exceptions when applied to more complex geometries. The algorithms in the lib are implemented recursively. After some web search I figured out that maximum stack size in WebWorkers is much lower than in main thread. I changed the algorithm implementation to an iterative approach. After that, the CSG lib works within WebWorkers. This way, CSG can be done also for complex geometries taking a larger amount of time (in my app sometimes 2s-10s) without blocking your UI.","created_at":"2018-02-05T08:31:56.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/13235#issuecomment-363014002","id":363014002,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/13235","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MzAxNDAwMg==","updated_at":"2018-02-05T08:31:56.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/363014002","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/matthias-w\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/matthias-w\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/7372127?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/matthias-w","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/matthias-w\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/matthias-w","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/matthias-w\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNzIxMjc=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/matthias-w\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/matthias-w\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/matthias-w\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"matthias-w","type":"User","id":7372127,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/matthias-w\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/matthias-w\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I would suggest that this be explored with some examples before any new `WebGLWorkerRenderer` API is created...
