It should never ever directly be used to add a feature to the library. It is by itself a feature of the library, and it should never ever go past that. \r\n\r\nIt should only be used by users to add features to their applications. I hope this clarifies years of confusion. :) I'll try to write this more legalese. \r\n\r\nI've used the `GLTFLoader` example because that class is in examples and simulates someone having their own app. Someone developing AFrame probably has to rely on `GLTFLoader`, i myself have never ever used it, so the need for spec gloss, Khronos group extensions, instancing and serialization, are different between our apps. \r\n\r\nThis is conceptually totally different from `NodeMaterial` there you actually do want to integrate it into the core and base other features on top of it. \r\n\r\nping @mrdoob ping @donmccurdy ","created_at":"2018-06-15T17:21:22.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/14231#issuecomment-397688130","id":397688130,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14231","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzY4ODEzMA==","updated_at":"2018-06-15T17:23:28.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/397688130","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/4681282?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/pailhead","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODEyODI=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"pailhead","type":"User","id":4681282,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/orgs"}},{"index":1,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14245#issuecomment-397957636","created_at":"2018-06-18T06:52:28.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/14231#issuecomment-397958164","id":397958164,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14231","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Nzk1ODE2NA==","updated_at":"2018-06-18T06:52:28.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/397958164","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/97088?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDg4","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"mrdoob","type":"User","id":97088,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/orgs"}}]}
