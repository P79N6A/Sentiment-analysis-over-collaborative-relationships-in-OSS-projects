That adds white vertex colors at least, and may also be spitting the mesh vertices into triangle soup. The source mesh has 16980 vertices but the generated glTF has 98436.\r\n\r\nI've been looking for some nice CC-BY examples online that use both skinning and morph targets but haven't found anything I like yet. Having morph targets control facial animations is an illustrative use case, which wouldn't be possible on the Samba model, so I'm not sure about that.","created_at":"2018-10-22T20:16:52.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14737#issuecomment-431967712","id":431967712,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14737","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTk2NzcxMg==","updated_at":"2018-10-23T02:43:28.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/431967712","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}},{"index":13,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> Having morph targets control facial animations is an illustrative use case, which wouldn't be possible on the Samba model, so I'm not sure about that.\r\n\r\nAgreed, I was thinking of something much simpler like shrinking \/ growing the head.
