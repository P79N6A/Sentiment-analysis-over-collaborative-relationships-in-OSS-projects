Yes, I have tested the ZXZ rotation and it works exactly as I\u2019d expect it to. I haven\u2019t tested all the other orders that I added, but I can definitely do that. \n\n2. Yes, they are intrinsic rotations in their current form. Sometimes we do use extrinsic rotations to suit certain CNC machine controls that expect the tilted workplane to be calculated by a series of rotations around a fixed coordinate system. This is much less common. \n\n3. I\u2019m kind of surprised that no one has asked for this previously. It\u2019s a very common requirement to calculate the rotations in this way in the world of machine control, and I\u2019ve started to see a few machine control apps built with threejs. See ncviewer.com as an example. That doesn\u2019t do multi axis plane rotations yet as far as I know, but I\u2019d be surprised if they weren\u2019t on the roadmap. \nIn my opinion, I feel that for completeness of the Euler library, they are just as valid as the Tait-Bryan rotations. Additionally, it was very confusing to me that I got no rotation at all when I entered \u201cZXZ\u201d as the order, as the documentation didn\u2019t specify that only Tait-Bryan angles were supported, so it was only when I went digging in the source, that I found out why. I think having them there would save others\u2019 confusion. \n\n4.  Personally, for my current use case, I\u2019d need all of the methods I\u2019ve added. Each machine control we work with uses a particular order in that set. It varies a lot. \n\nI could write the conversions to and from quat and matrix4 if necessary. \n\nThanks for considering this. \n\n\n> On 9\/03\/2018, at 3:39 PM, WestLangley <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> @thezwap\n> \n> Did you test this code?\n> \n> Are the \"proper\" Euler angles you added of the intrinsic type?\n> \n> There has be no demand for these Euler types in three.js that I have been aware of.

Having a `Quaternion.setFromProperEuler` and `Quaternion.setFromEuler` would likely cause confusion, require an extra class, and support for additional utilities for no real reason. The resultant `Quaternion` is all that's needed.\r\n\r\n>I\u2019ve started to see a few machine control apps built with threejs. See ncviewer.com as an example. That doesn\u2019t do multi axis plane rotations yet as far as I know, but I\u2019d be surprised if they weren\u2019t on the roadmap.\r\n\r\nNCViewer, to a certain degree, can do _some_ multi axis rotations:\r\n\r\n![image](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/13877593\/37269522-f91d131c-2587-11e8-903f-b6ab19c0c20c.png)\r\n\r\nBut I'm getting around the limitation by using multiple `Quaternion.setFromAngleAxis` to manually set the rotation order so to speak. This means instead of just creating one Quaternion I'm creating up to 3 (and to be honest, that's mostly because it was easier than figuring out the math to do it properly).\r\n\r\nThis is also something that Autodesk worked on relatively recently with our post processor ([forum post about it](https:\/\/forums.autodesk.com\/t5\/hsm-post-processor-forum\/calculating-euler-angles\/td-p\/6688480)), so to me it makes sense to add support for in Three.js as well. This way users won't have to figure out the math on their own if they want to work with Proper Euler angles.\r\n\r\nOverall, it doesn't look like this would add much code and it would be useful to anyone working with simulating and driving multi axis CNC machines, multi axis 3D printers, and possibly even robotic arms (though I only have limited experience there).","created_at":"2018-03-12T07:41:47.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/13538#issuecomment-372218116","id":372218116,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/13538","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3MjIxODExNg==","updated_at":"2018-03-12T07:41:47.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/372218116","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/13877593?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/XanderLuciano","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODc3NTkz","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"XanderLuciano","type":"User","id":13877593,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/orgs"}},{"index":14,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks, @XanderLuciano.\r\n\r\nLet's do this: create `examples\/js\/utils\/MathUtils.js`, and define\r\n```javascript\r\nTHREE.MathUtils.setQuaternionFromProperEuler( q, a, b, c, order );\r\n```\r\nThere is no need to include a testbed, but it would be nice to see a link to one with a DAT.GUI supporting `a`, `b`, `c`, and `order`.
