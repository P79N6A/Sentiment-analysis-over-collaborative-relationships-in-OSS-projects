An alternative would be to make `isCombinedCamera` for this class and then check whether this camera is `inPerspectiveMode`. But this would mean adding all kinds of additional checks for combined camera inside `Raycaster` or `OrbitControls` (or whereever it is needed) and that is probably not desirable either.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative would be to add `this.inPerspectiveMode = true;` to `THREE.PerspectiveCamera` and `this.inOrthographicMode = true;`  to `THREE.OrthographicCamera`. Then in the `Raycaster` and the `OrbitControls` check for `inPerspectiveMode` and `inOrthographicMode` instead of the existing `instanceof` checks or my `isPerspectiveCamera\/isOrthographicCamera` check. \r\n\r\nThis would be more correct. Should I refactor to use this instead?\r\n\r\nThen if people have their own custom camera class they could implement a similar property.\r\n\r\nAbout the example, I think you mean buggy when using the following functions?\r\n\r\n`Views: Top view | Bottom view | Left view | Right view | Front view | Back view | Look at Scene`\r\n\r\nOr did you mean other bugs? \r\nIt is because those buttons set the camera position and not the controls target. If the example is useful I could change these function or remove those buttons. Not sure if the example is needed though. I just wanted to quickly demonstrate its working and could simply remove it from the PR.","created_at":"2017-02-17T08:41:20.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/10811#issuecomment-280589301","id":280589301,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10811","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDU4OTMwMQ==","updated_at":"2017-02-17T08:42:42.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/280589301","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Wilt\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Wilt\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/2419627?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Wilt","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Wilt\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Wilt","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Wilt\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTk2Mjc=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Wilt\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Wilt\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Wilt\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Wilt","type":"User","id":2419627,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Wilt\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Wilt\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I'd restore `inPerspectiveMode` and add a getter for `isPerspectiveCamera`.
