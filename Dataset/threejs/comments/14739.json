If you ensure your objects have unique names, using node names and `scene.getObjectByName(...)` may be more robust.

And please excuse my lack of explanation. I understood that it is impossible to map 1:1.\r\n\r\nVRM, for example, uses nodes' indices to specify which bone is humanoid's head, arm, etc. or which node has a collider. I had tried to use node names and `scene.getObjectByName(...)` for mapping. But node names  sometimes conflict because they are not guaranteed to be unique in glTF.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think `scene.getObjectByName(...)` is a flexible method. This is enough in most cases. So I will try to solve the issue at my own application for the time being.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-19T06:38:30.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14739#issuecomment-414107281","id":414107281,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14739","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDEwNzI4MQ==","updated_at":"2018-08-19T06:38:30.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/414107281","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rdrgn\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rdrgn\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/9990535?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rdrgn","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rdrgn\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/rdrgn","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rdrgn\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTA1MzU=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rdrgn\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rdrgn\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rdrgn\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"rdrgn","type":"User","id":9990535,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rdrgn\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rdrgn\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Closing for now, but feel free to comment on https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/15087 if you have preferences on how we handle duplicate node names.
