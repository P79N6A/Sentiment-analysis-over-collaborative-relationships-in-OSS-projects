Or do you disagree with me on that hypothesis?\n\nI think that because our color is restricted to LDR, it can not represent unbounded colors required for lighting or emission, although it is great for relative spectral measures like absorption, and reflection.  But the decomposition of a HDR light color into color and intensity is not well defined unlike the decomposition of a line into a unitless direction and length.  The reason is that we do not use \"normalized colors\" of some type of unit intensity.\n\nBecause we do not use a normalized color, the decomposition of a HDR light color is arbitrary.  Remember:\n\nRGB( 0.1, 0.1, 0.1 ) \\* intensity( 10 ) === RBG( 1, 1, 1 ) \\* intensity( 1 )\n\nBecause these are equivalent in result, but their intensities different by an order of magnitude, it is hard to say with any accuracy that the units are in intensity.\n\nWe could explore normalizing our color when we go to use it (r+b+g must sum to 1 or something like that), but I'd prefer to find a precedent for this in another tool, and I worry about being confusing to users used to how other tools work.\n","created_at":"2015-11-18T02:54:29.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/7621#issuecomment-157586034","id":157586034,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7621","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzU4NjAzNA==","updated_at":"2015-11-18T02:56:32.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/157586034","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/588541?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/bhouston","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODU0MQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"bhouston","type":"User","id":588541,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"Ended up implementing it in a different way.
