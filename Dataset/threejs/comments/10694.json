The issue is that Unity3D does the same fix I do and I had people complaining that Clara.io wasn't as good as Unity3D because it wouldn't render their tires correctly with normal maps.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that tools like 3DS Max create geometry like this really easily.  Create one side of a tire and then reflect it for the other side.  Then export it.  I am not sure we want to fix geometry on import for situations like this - I am not sure it is possible to fix automatically because you actually want this UV mapping because it puts the right part of the normal map in the right spot (I think if you change the UVs it will change where the normals are located), it is just backwards so the derived normal is incorrect.\r\n\r\nWe are running with this in our production fork of Three.JS in https:\/\/Clara.io and it fixed the client issue.  Just trying to contribute it back.  I can not share their geometry though that reproduced this issue. :(","created_at":"2017-02-01T02:23:38.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/10694#issuecomment-276555822","id":276555822,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10694","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjU1NTgyMg==","updated_at":"2017-02-01T02:23:38.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/276555822","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/588541?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/bhouston","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODU0MQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"bhouston","type":"User","id":588541,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am not insistent that this gets merged back into mainline Three.JS.
