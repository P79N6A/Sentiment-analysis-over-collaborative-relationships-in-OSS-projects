I\u00b4m using a lot of parametric Geometries (currently THREE.Geometry). These building parts (doors windows etc.) use a lot of the Geometry.merge functionality. \nI have decided in the past to move to BufferGeometry to gain speed improvements at geometry creation. As Wilt pointed out I was confused, that BufferGeometry.merge is something different than Geometry.merge. ( Maybe there should be different names to visualize that there is different functionality behind?)\nTo solve my problem I\u00b4ve introduced a new class (BufferData) which holds vertex, uvs and group data in standard arrays. This class also has some basic modification functionality (translate, move, mirror, merge). After I have finished all my vertex modification and merges I then create a BufferGeometry from it and add it to the scene.\nThis also means that I don\u00b4t have to take care of disposing my geometry parts, because it\u00b4s just pure data which THREE don\u00b4t know about.\n\nP.S. a big thanks to @mrdoob and the other contributors - your tool helped me really a lot! \n","created_at":"2016-08-03T18:17:06.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/8162#issuecomment-237322705","id":237322705,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8162","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNzMyMjcwNQ==","updated_at":"2016-08-03T18:17:06.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/237322705","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/h1Modeling\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/h1Modeling\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/17990673?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/h1Modeling","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/h1Modeling\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/h1Modeling","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/h1Modeling\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTkwNjcz","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/h1Modeling\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/h1Modeling\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/h1Modeling\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"h1Modeling","type":"User","id":17990673,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/h1Modeling\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/h1Modeling\/orgs"}},{"index":14,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I also ran into this issue.
