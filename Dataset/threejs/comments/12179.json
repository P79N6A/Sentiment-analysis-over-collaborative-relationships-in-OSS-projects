But because they need a lot of resource, the page can turn irresponsive or trigger a context loss.\r\n\r\n- panning less when zoomed more : I did not change that, check https:\/\/threejs.org\/examples\/?q=orbit#misc_controls_orbit\r\n\r\n- render loop pattern : I'll reset this example to its previous state and provide a second one.","created_at":"2017-09-13T07:23:47.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/12179#issuecomment-329081998","id":329081998,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12179","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTA4MTk5OA==","updated_at":"2017-09-16T15:00:11.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/329081998","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/10037511?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Astrak","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDM3NTEx","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Astrak","type":"User","id":10037511,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Phew, i'm not very familiar with the code of `OrbitControls` but i generally prefer a simple code base.
