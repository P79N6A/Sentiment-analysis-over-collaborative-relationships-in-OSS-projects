Certainly if you just move the pivot point in the interface, both get moved together, and while it is possible to [*select*](https:\/\/forums.autodesk.com\/t5\/maya-forum\/rotate-pivot-and-scale-pivot\/m-p\/7436261#M47959) them seperately, any way I tried moving them resulted in both being moved. \r\n\r\n* 3DS Max: I exported the same scene from 3DS Max (using \"Send to Max\" from Maya).
