For more background: I\u2019m taking the position reported by a 2D thumb trackpad on a VR controller, translating that to a rotation angle about the Y axis in 3D space, adding that to the rotation of the controller itself about the Y axis, then propelling the world in the inverse of that direction. (Result: Flying along the floor in VR!) \r\n\r\nI tried changing the rotation order before checking the Y value (as you suggested) and confirmed this does indeed yield the full -180\u02da to +180\u02da range\u2014so equivalent to the Quaternion.getYaw() function above. This is great because there\u2019s no need to add a patch to THREE. But also... Although it makes total sense in retrospect it wasn\u2019t obvious to me beforehand, perhaps it won\u2019t be obvious to others? \r\n\r\n(Aside: I did a quick look for `THREE.VRControls.getDirection()` but didn\u2019t see a class or instance method with that name.)\r\n","created_at":"2016-12-07T17:52:25.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10307#issuecomment-265519892","id":265519892,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10307","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NTUxOTg5Mg==","updated_at":"2016-12-07T17:52:25.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/265519892","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stewdio\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stewdio\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/342184?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stewdio","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stewdio\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/stewdio","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stewdio\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE4NA==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stewdio\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stewdio\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stewdio\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"stewdio","type":"User","id":342184,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stewdio\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stewdio\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":">I tried changing the rotation order before checking the Y value (as you suggested) and confirmed this does indeed yield the full -180\u02da to +180\u02da range\u2014so equivalent to the Quaternion.getYaw() function above.
