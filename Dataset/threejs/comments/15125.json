I'll remove the \" ..2 triangular..\"  line - if it seems confusing, it is confusing. It is accurate I think, but I did wonder about it.\r\n\r\n2. The point about mentioning the inheritance from Geometry is that nowhere in the docs is the concept of inheritance and sub-classes explained. And though it probably seems very easy and natural to a professional js developer, it is quite a hard concept to understand from the code when you first come to it - I certainly found it hard to grasp what the code was doing, not being well versed in javascript. (I've just checked : the W3schools javascript tutorial doesn't appear to mention the sub-class mechanism used in three.js for example, though all the individual bits are there.)\r\n\r\nA better approach would be to explain somewhere, probably in the Getting Started section, how it works in simple terms - it's not necessary to explain how, just that some classes inherit properties and methods from other classes, and that that is indicated by the base class and an arrow at the top of the page. But I thought that was too ambitious for my first effort. I'll take your advice - remove the line? Explain about inheritance somewhere? \r\n\r\n3. Yes, I know about BoxBufferGeometry.
