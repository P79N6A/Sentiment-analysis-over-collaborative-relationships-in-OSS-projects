Unfortunately, there is no way to forces user to set that value, unlike C++ it will be detected during compile time. If it must be set, why not throw an error in case it's not set instead of silently passes through and returns weird graphics behavior? As a new user of three.js, I wasted quite a few time finding out the issue, and i'm pretty sure I wouldn't be the only person who will fall into this pitfall.\r\n\r\n2. There is no way to prevent the user from assigning 0 to `stride`, which would cause divide-by-zero problem @WestLangley just mentioned.\r\n\r\n2. The API document [here](https:\/\/threejs.org\/docs\/#api\/core\/InterleavedBuffer) fails to give a clear description of what `stride` means. Based on my experience with OpenGL\/WebGL API, the `stride` here is the number of primitive elements, float or int, for vertex attribute. So the `count` seems to be the number of vertices whose attributes are defined in the first argument `array`.\r\n\r\n3. And, correct me if I'm wrong, the [`this.count`](https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/blob\/dev\/src\/core\/InterleavedBuffer.js#L13) doesn't find any usage through out the entire [WebGLRender](https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/blob\/r85\/src\/renderers\/WebGLRenderer.js#L973), while the `stride` has been used in the critical GL call [`_gl.vertexAttribPointer`](https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/blob\/r85\/src\/renderers\/WebGLRenderer.js#L973). This also  explains why after assigning `stride` 0, which is not exactly correct and `this.count` is now `Infinity`, it makes my rendering back to normal, because it has never been used any where in the framework.\r\n\r\nSo, I would suggest setting up a safe guard to check the value of `stride` and prompt user in case of `undefined` or `0`.\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-28T22:50:28.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11407#issuecomment-304545405","id":304545405,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11407","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNDU0NTQwNQ==","updated_at":"2017-05-28T22:52:06.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/304545405","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stonexjr\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stonexjr\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/2969316?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stonexjr","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stonexjr\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/stonexjr","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stonexjr\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NjkzMTY=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stonexjr\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stonexjr\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stonexjr\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"stonexjr","type":"User","id":2969316,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stonexjr\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/stonexjr\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Yes, this is JavaScript, and we have had these discussions [before](https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/10641#issuecomment-276487448).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you feel the documentation is inadequate or incorrect, this would be a great time to help us improve it.  :)\r\n\r\nIn the code you referenced, `count` is the number of vertices.
