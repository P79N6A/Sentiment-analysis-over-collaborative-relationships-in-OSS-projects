I will have to defer to @bhouston.\r\n\r\nI personally have no problem with with circular **intra**-modular dependencies (within a single module circular dependencies have no significant cost and removing them has costs to readability, adds duplication, makes design more obtuse, takes time.)   I am against **inter**-modular circular dependencies.  They should only go one way between larger modules.  For example I am completely okay with all circular dependences between the classes in the \/math folder.  But I am very very against \/math depending on stuff in \/core or \/webgl.\r\n\r\nInline this math in another fundamental math class is just making the library bigger, more verbose and harder to maintain.  Do we really think someone will want to just include Quaternion and not Vector3?  That scenario seems very unlikely.  If that scenario is unlikely, then why do this change?  We are just making the code bigger and more verbose for no real benefit.\r\n\r\nBut I can see someone wanting to include \/math but not bring in \/webgl or \/core.\r\n\r\nThat said, I am against this type of change, but it does't really impact anyone significantly.  It is more of a make work project.  I think that most open source projects under go random drift like this and it is best to just coast with it for the most part, as it makes more people feel like they are contributors.","created_at":"2018-08-02T12:39:12.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/14466#issuecomment-409911738","id":409911738,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14466","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTkxMTczOA==","updated_at":"2018-08-02T12:43:53.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/409911738","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/588541?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/bhouston","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODU0MQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"bhouston","type":"User","id":588541,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I am a broken record on this: https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6241#issuecomment-82525014","created_at":"2018-08-02T12:49:51.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/14466#issuecomment-409914695","id":409914695,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14466","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTkxNDY5NQ==","updated_at":"2018-08-02T12:49:51.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/409914695","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/588541?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/bhouston","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODU0MQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"bhouston","type":"User","id":588541,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Sounds reasonable \ud83d\udc4d ","created_at":"2018-08-02T13:05:18.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/14466#issuecomment-409918953","id":409918953,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14466","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTkxODk1Mw==","updated_at":"2018-08-02T13:39:15.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/409918953","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/12612165?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mugen87","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Mugen87","type":"User","id":12612165,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/orgs"}}]}
