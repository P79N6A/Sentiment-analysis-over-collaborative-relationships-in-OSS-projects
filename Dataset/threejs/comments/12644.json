Kindly note that the **mtl** file has multiple textures (even if technically using the same bitmap).\r\n\r\nTo get the material and texture applied, I had to bind them manually. \r\n\r\n```\r\nmtlLoader.load(materialUrl, ( materials ) => {\r\n\r\n\tmaterials.preload();\r\n\r\n\t\/\/ Load object after materials\r\n\t\/\/ loadingManager.onLoad = function(){\r\n\t\/\/ objLoader.setMaterials( materials );\r\n\r\n\tobjLoader.load(\r\n\t\tmodelUrl,\r\n\t\t\/\/ called when resource is loaded\r\n\t\t( object ) => {\r\n\t\t\tconst bbox = new THREE.Box3().setFromObject(object);\r\n\t\t\tconst cameraPos = new THREE.Vector3( );\r\n\t\t\tmaterials.materials['Material__3337'].map = texture;\r\n\r\n\t\t\tobject.traverse(function ( child ) {\r\n\t\t\t\tif ( child instanceof THREE.Mesh ) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tchild.material = materials.materials['Material__3337'];\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\r\n\t\t\tscene.add( object );\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried waiting until all assets were loaded (**loadingManager.onload**); no go. No loading error, but the material was not applied. I was able to get rid of the initial error, and get the texture applied when loading it manually. \r\n\r\nSee snippet above.\r\n\r\nI should add: in this setup, we use webpack's file-loader to load **obj**, **mtl**, and all image types.\r\nHence, when loading assets at runtime, we use `require(assetPath)` and `webpack-dev-server` emits a valid url for the asset.\r\n\r\nSo: in any case I had to properly \"prepare\" the asset, by ensuring its url was emitted (`require..`). \r\n\r\nBut even with that: the material AND texture were only applied when I bound them explicitly.","created_at":"2017-11-14T12:33:23.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12644#issuecomment-344245414","id":344245414,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12644","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NDI0NTQxNA==","updated_at":"2017-11-14T12:34:58.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/344245414","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maurocolella\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maurocolella\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/761780?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maurocolella","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maurocolella\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/maurocolella","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maurocolella\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTc4MA==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maurocolella\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maurocolella\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maurocolella\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"maurocolella","type":"User","id":761780,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maurocolella\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maurocolella\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"Hard to help fixing this one without access to the problematic assets...","created_at":"2017-11-26T09:47:38.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12644#issuecomment-346995972","id":346995972,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12644","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0Njk5NTk3Mg==","updated_at":"2017-11-26T09:47:51.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/346995972","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/97088?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDg4","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"mrdoob","type":"User","id":97088,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"NONE","body":"I understand.
