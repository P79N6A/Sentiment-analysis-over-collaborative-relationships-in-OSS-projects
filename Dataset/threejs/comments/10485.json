Also, the `ZYX` order is used in the aeronautics industry, but unlike our coordinate system with positive y-up, in the aeronautics industry, I believe the coordinate system typically sets positive z-down (so headings are measured clockwise), and with the aircraft aligned with the x-axis. The equivalent order in our y-up coordinate system would be `YXZ`, although that order implies counterclockwise headings.\r\n\r\nIf we were to change the default Euler order in three.js, I would select `YXZ`, because it is the most intuitive and would lead to much less user confusion.","created_at":"2017-06-03T16:56:29.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10485#issuecomment-305987480","id":305987480,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10485","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTk4NzQ4MA==","updated_at":"2017-06-03T17:00:52.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/305987480","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1000017?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/WestLangley","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDAwMTc=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"WestLangley","type":"User","id":1000017,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/orgs"}},{"index":6,"author_association":"NONE","body":"@looeee \r\n> Three.js uses one of the two most commonly used conventions.\r\n\r\nThree.js defaults to Tait-Bryan XYZ, while Wikipedia says that one of the conventions is Tait-Bryan ZYX.
