It renames local variables, and if it encounters an unknown symbol, it leaves it untouched, assuming it's a global variable.\n\nThe [advanced mode](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/closure\/compiler\/docs\/compilation_levels) behaves like a compiler in a strongly typed language (assuming type info is available): it warns about unknown functions or properties, warns if you called a function with the wrong number of arguments or if you have used a string parameter where a number was expected.\n\n As an example, the simple mode transforms the following code\n\n``` javascript\nfunction fn() {\n    var foo = {}; \/\/ local variable, safe to rename this\n    foo.bar();    \/\/ undefined property, will crash here\n}\nfn();\n```\n\nwithout any warnings into \n\n``` javascript\nfunction fn(){({}).bar()}fn();\n```\n\nwhich will obviously crash on `({}).bar()`. The advanced mode outputs the following code\n\n``` javascript\n({}).a(); \/\/ fn() inlined, private member 'bar' renamed to 'a'\n```\n\nwhich still crashes, but the compiler also gives a warning\n\n```\nProperty bar never defined on foo at line 3 character 0.\n```\n- The bugs closure found were the type of bugs where I had a typo in a function name or where I passed one `THREE.Vector3` to `Matrix4.makeTranslation` instead of three separate numbers for the x, y, and z components.\n- If I had full test coverage (which I don't), I would have found those bugs sooner or later. Sometimes they are hard to debug, though, if they don't manifest immediately.\n- If threejs supplied an up-to-date exports file with each new release (huge effort to maintain), the closure compiler would catch all problems coming from a changing API (as was the case for `Matrix4.makeTranslation`).\n- Setting up the closure compiler is too much work for me, as it needs a java runtime.

guess I just might write such a post. Just to clarify, though, the reason one would want to run Three.js through closure (with or without an externs file) is not necessarily only for the performance optimizations. Closure is primarily intended to help you write maintainable code in JavaScript (particularly, very large code bases). The goal is to help developers \"tame\" JavaScript (writing native JS), rather than to \"avoid\" it (using GWT or other similar tools). If you simply try to compile Three.js as part of a Closure project, the compiler might yell at you because Three.js might not conform to some of its standards (not JSDoc'd enough, maybe?). Using the --language_in compiler flag solves that as of right now, though you'll get a few warnings. If you simply want to compile your own JS code, but reference Three.js as an external library (thus leaving all of Three.js's codebase untouched and unoptimized), you will need the externs file mentioned above. Without the externs file, Closure will throw compilation errors saying that THREE.\\* is not declared anywhere, etc.\n\nWhile I don't get to writing my blog post explaining how and why one might want to use Three.js on a Closure project, here's the best introductory presentation on Google Closure tools I've seen: (From Google I\/O 2011) https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M3uWx-fhjUc (I know it's a long video, but really makes it clear what the purpose of the compiler is, and what the different compilation modes actually do. It also describes why you'd need an externs file).\n","created_at":"2014-01-13T21:06:46.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/341#issuecomment-32211399","id":32211399,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/341","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMjExMzk5","updated_at":"2014-01-13T21:06:46.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/32211399","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/formigone\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/formigone\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/852234?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/formigone","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/formigone\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/formigone","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/formigone\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MjIzNA==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/formigone\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/formigone\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/formigone\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"formigone","type":"User","id":852234,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/formigone\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/formigone\/orgs"}}]}
