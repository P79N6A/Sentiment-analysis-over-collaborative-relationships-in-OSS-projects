However, what I did to have nice rotation around the sphere is a little tricky: I make rotate the sphere around its center rather than moving the camera around the planet. I do not know if it is acceptable, but it simplify a lot all process when going further with all other features (tiles, building position, ground elevation, etc...).\n\n   So, I can suggest you an OrbitControls modification, but I think it will complexify existing code.\n\n   Mrdood, an advice?\n\nClement.\n\nOn 6 November 2017 02:50:50 CET, Lewy Blue <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n>You have added a lot of unrelated files here - if you do a `git pull\n>upstream dev` it should fix most of them.
