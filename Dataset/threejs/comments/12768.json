And IMO they should be tested harder than public interface.\r\n\r\nIt's OK for people to contribute tests of private methods when they're helpful, but in general I do not think all private methods should have tests. See [discussion here](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/105007\/should-i-test-private-methods-or-only-public-ones). It is better to test what happens, rather than _how_ it happens, and private methods are often the latter.\r\n\r\nCertainly it is fine for tests on private methods to be written \u2014 I have no objection to that \u2014 but I would rather add those tests only when\/if they make sense, and not to have TODOs complaining when they aren't there.","created_at":"2017-11-30T23:04:25.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/12768#issuecomment-348349658","id":348349658,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12768","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0ODM0OTY1OA==","updated_at":"2017-11-30T23:04:25.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/348349658","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ok i understand your opinion !\r\n\r\nBut like said in comment:\r\n\r\n> I disagree. Ideally, you write a quick test before you start coding a function. Think of typical input and what the output will be.
