Each object type has its own raycast method which receives the raycaster as argument and calculates the intersections ( i.e. [Point.js](https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/blob\/r87\/src\/objects\/Points.js#L30) ). So I don't think GPU and OS should have any influence on this.","created_at":"2017-10-20T13:16:31.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12426#issuecomment-338203191","id":338203191,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12426","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODIwMzE5MQ==","updated_at":"2017-10-20T13:16:31.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/338203191","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kchapelier\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kchapelier\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/5741699?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kchapelier","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kchapelier\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/kchapelier","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kchapelier\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDE2OTk=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kchapelier\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kchapelier\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kchapelier\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"kchapelier","type":"User","id":5741699,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kchapelier\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kchapelier\/orgs"}},{"index":13,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I'm working with more than 40 Milions of points and can raycast them without any problems.
