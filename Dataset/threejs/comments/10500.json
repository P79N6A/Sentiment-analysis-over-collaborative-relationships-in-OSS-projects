Is there an alternative way we could tell the loader that the url points to a binary file?\r\n- The parse method can't be used since it requires the extensions to be passed as an argument and the extensions are not accessible from outside the class. I recommend moving the extension handling and JSON parsing (line 37 to 50) from `.load` to `.parse` and removing the `extensions` argument.","created_at":"2017-01-04T11:53:34.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/10500#issuecomment-270354703","id":270354703,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10500","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDM1NDcwMw==","updated_at":"2017-01-04T11:53:34.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/270354703","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Jeremy-Gaillard\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Jeremy-Gaillard\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1814191?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Jeremy-Gaillard","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Jeremy-Gaillard\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Jeremy-Gaillard","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Jeremy-Gaillard\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTQxOTE=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Jeremy-Gaillard\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Jeremy-Gaillard\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Jeremy-Gaillard\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Jeremy-Gaillard","type":"User","id":1814191,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Jeremy-Gaillard\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Jeremy-Gaillard\/orgs"}},{"index":1,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Thanks @Jeremy-Gaillard, I've updated the PR with both suggested changes.\r\n\r\nOne side effect: because we can't tell in advance if the file is binary without the `.glb` extension, we need to always make the request with `responseType= \"arraybuffer\"`. I don't know why that is, but the plaintext responses come back with fewer bytes than arraybuffer responses, breaking the binary parser.
