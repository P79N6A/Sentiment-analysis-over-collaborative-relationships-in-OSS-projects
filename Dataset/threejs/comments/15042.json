needed after this PR?\r\n\r\nThis turned out to be quite an interesting question. as my initial expectation was that it wouldn't be needed, but my gut said leave it just in case there's some edge case. \r\n\r\nlong story short: It's still needed for edge cases.\r\n\r\nRealistically, `height: 100%` (and width) should be all that's needed, _but_ there are are a few edges cases that including `overflow: hidden` takes care of. One such edge case is this picture:\r\n\r\n Where a resize event can cause an inactive scrollbar to get 'stuck'\r\n\r\n![image](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/13877593\/46899255-f39cb980-ce45-11e8-928a-38b4916d1dc3.png)\r\n\r\nSo it does appear that there are contrived ways to break the page if you don't include `overflow: hidden`. The easiest way was to just the window size just slightly, immediately after a resize event occurs.\r\n\r\nIt can also cause an odd side effect of \"ghost scrollbars\" that flicker as you shrink the window down. These scrollbars show up momentarily in between resize events. \r\n\r\nSo there are a bunch of dd edge cases that suddenly become an issue if you remove `overflow: hidden`. \r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nI also believe because on this page: https:\/\/threejs.org\/examples\/?q=misc#misc_controls_trackball\r\n\r\nis  in an `iframe`, the overflowing element is clipped by the iframe first, the `body` doesn't have any direct children that overflow, and thus, no overscroll behavior.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not 100% on that last point. Scrolling can be really weird sometimes.","created_at":"2018-10-13T01:01:37.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/15042#issuecomment-429498529","id":429498529,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/15042","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTQ5ODUyOQ==","updated_at":"2018-10-13T01:01:37.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/429498529","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/13877593?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/XanderLuciano","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODc3NTkz","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"XanderLuciano","type":"User","id":13877593,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/XanderLuciano\/orgs"}},{"index":5,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Would it also work to set `overscroll-behavior: none;` (instead of setting `box-sizing: border-box;`)?","created_at":"2018-10-13T10:54:19.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/15042#issuecomment-429532475","id":429532475,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/15042","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTUzMjQ3NQ==","updated_at":"2018-10-13T10:54:19.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/429532475","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/12612165?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mugen87","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Mugen87","type":"User","id":12612165,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/orgs"}},{"index":6,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"Hmm...

- you had asked for feedback and testing from iOS users (sorry for the late response, been under a very tight deadline at work recently). I've got a video capture showing behavior of the threejs trackball control ion iOS 12.0.1 in the Safari browser with the latest code changes (including overflow: hidden and box-sizing: border-box).\r\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/2a5jGpH1Gzo\r\n\r\nFrame rate doesn't drop off, but you can see that it still tries to overscroll.

Looks like I've only managed to solve one piece of puzzle with this bug, but your video highlights the secondary issue quite well.\r\n\r\nAfter some digging it appears this is a \"feature\" apple added to safari to improve accessibility by ignoring the `user-scalable=no` meta tag.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Cleanest way to resolve all of this in iOS\/Safari is to simply attach the trackball controls to the div for the renderer rather than letting it attach to the document.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario is calling `preventDefault()` or `stopPropagation()` required as well? (From my initial research it would appear so).\r\n\r\nSeems like I might need to go find an iPhone to borrow in order to properly figure out the ideal solution. Seems there are some potential drawbacks with some solutions such as breaking scrolling completely. \r\n\r\nI did find [one promising solution on stack overflow](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/37808180\/disable-viewport-zooming-ios-10-safari) though:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nwindow.addEventListener(\r\n    \"touchmove\",\r\n    function(event) {\r\n        if (event.scale !== 1) {\r\n            event.preventDefault();\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    { passive: false }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know there are some additional CSS methods to try as well, so I'll have to report back with my findings.\r\n\r\nEdit: using css's `touch-action` doesn't seem to be a viable solution due to lack of support in safari specifically.
