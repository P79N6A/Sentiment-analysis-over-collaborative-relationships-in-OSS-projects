With your code, offset values are treated as integers.\r\n\r\nI can't find in your `dae` file any information about texture offset or repeat values. I also think that the current parsing implementation is pretty identical to the old loader, see https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/blob\/master\/examples\/js\/loaders\/ColladaLoader.js#L3537-L3562 \r\n\r\nPlease provide a [life example](https:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/f2Lommf5\/) that shows the bug or at least an appropriate `dae` file with the respective textures (upload a zip that contains everything). \r\n\r\nBTW: The order of case statements does not matter. This difference between the old and new loader  is negligible.","created_at":"2017-10-31T16:19:06.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/12536#issuecomment-340816598","id":340816598,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12536","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MDgxNjU5OA==","updated_at":"2017-10-31T16:23:04.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/340816598","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/12612165?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mugen87","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Mugen87","type":"User","id":12612165,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/orgs"}},{"index":1,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Well I retested my change and you are right, it doesn't really solve the problem, not sure how but it was solved on my machine the other day :confused: \r\n\r\nSince the problem is still there I'll close the PR since it can be misleading and let us continue the discussion in [the issue page](https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12525) ;) \r\n","created_at":"2017-11-01T01:23:27.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/12536#issuecomment-340952097","id":340952097,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12536","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MDk1MjA5Nw==","updated_at":"2017-11-01T01:26:25.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/340952097","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MohmadAyman\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MohmadAyman\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/10261903?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MohmadAyman","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MohmadAyman\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/MohmadAyman","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MohmadAyman\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjYxOTAz","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MohmadAyman\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MohmadAyman\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MohmadAyman\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"MohmadAyman","type":"User","id":10261903,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MohmadAyman\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MohmadAyman\/orgs"}}]}
