The main difference versus current `a.merge(b)` is that if you have many geometries to combine, the content of each attribute is only copied once. glTF has a concept of [primitives within meshes](https:\/\/github.com\/KhronosGroup\/glTF\/blob\/master\/specification\/2.0\/README.md#meshes), which can be used to separate draw calls e.g. for multi-material meshes.\r\n\r\nParsing the whole scene graph for mergeable things sounds hard, and was not something I was looking at. I also haven't tried to deal with geometries that have mismatched attributes; other than just bailing out early. I could imagine a similar helper in BufferGeometryUtils to merge an array of geometries or whole meshes, maybe being clever about only calling `.addGroup` when needed for a new material... this still requires that the user knows what they're doing \u2014 we probably don't want to deal with populating empty UVs if only one of N geometries have them \u2014 but in suitable cases could be more helpful and efficient than the `a.merge(b)` approach.","created_at":"2017-12-05T16:20:23.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/12804#issuecomment-349356248","id":349356248,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12804","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0OTM1NjI0OA==","updated_at":"2017-12-05T16:20:23.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/349356248","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Closing in favor of #13241.","created_at":"2018-02-04T00:29:38.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/12804#issuecomment-362869129","id":362869129,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12804","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2Mjg2OTEyOQ==","updated_at":"2018-02-04T00:29:38.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/362869129","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}}]}
