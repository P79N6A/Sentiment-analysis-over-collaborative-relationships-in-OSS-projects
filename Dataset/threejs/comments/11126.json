Pause button\r\n\r\nIf you have started the animation and then click \u201cpause\u201d, the motion is interrupted as it should, but then there is no possibility to continue from this state of movement (as one would expect it from a normal \u201cpause\u201d functionality). You have always to restart from the beginning by clicking \u201cstart\u201d again (try \u201crun\u201d with a low timescale to see the difference). I would expect for instance a toggling functionality of this button (pause\/continue).\r\n\r\nCuriously enough: If you are in \u201cstep\u201d mode, the \u201cpause\u201d button has the unpausing functionality which it is missing otherwise.\r\n\r\n2. Initial weights\r\n\r\nThe initial weights (idle 1\/3, walk 1\/3, run 1\/3) cause a non-natural movement of the character, until these values are changed. I think splitting the weights like this in such an initial static state makes not much sense. A mix of such animations makes only sense if it is done dynamically (like in the crossfades). So I would start for instance with (idle 0, walk 1, run 0).\r\n\r\n3. Interruptions instead of smooth transitions\r\n\r\nIf the user clicks on \u201cstart\u201c with (idle 0, walk 1, run 0) to let the character walk, and if he makes a crossfade from \u201cwalk to run\u201d afterwards, he should get a smooth transition. Instead of this the movement is interrupted first, since the action always starts from the beginning when clicking  \u201cwalk to run\u201d (although the character is already walking). Same behavior with the other crossfades.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-04T14:23:53.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11126#issuecomment-291515926","id":291515926,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11126","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MTUxNTkyNg==","updated_at":"2017-04-04T14:23:53.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/291515926","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jostschmithals\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jostschmithals\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/5700294?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jostschmithals","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jostschmithals\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/jostschmithals","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jostschmithals\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDAyOTQ=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jostschmithals\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jostschmithals\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jostschmithals\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"jostschmithals","type":"User","id":5700294,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jostschmithals\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jostschmithals\/orgs"}},{"index":1,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There are some redundancies, unnecessary repeatings and further mistakes in the code (for instance: If no skinnedMesh can be found, an Uncaught TypeError will be thrown in line 29 in spite of the related test in the code.
