Sometimes it's reasonable (when you write an A-Frame component, you're using three.js APIs directly) but if there's already a component that does something in A-Frame, you probably don't need any three.js code.

At first his question appeared focused and answerable with a code snippet so I proceeded to try and help. But after a while I realised he's basically asking: _\"How do I do what this other guy has done?\"_ which is verging on _\"Write my code for me\"_.  I wasn't going to write his code for him but I thought I would answer with a description and a hand-drawn diagram. Is he going to accept this as an answer? Place bets now.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that part of the problem is that newcomers to Three.js are coming from the clear simple world of the DOM where everything is very shallow and easy to decipher and expecting it to be the same with WebGL\/Three.js. Especially these days with browser's shipping in-built developer tools, it is normal for a self-taught junior dev to be able to pull apart someone's code and just understand the _technique_ at the same time. \r\n\r\nIf you have an input box on a web page and you want to know how it's doing that cool thing with the border changing colour on validation there's going to be 3 things to dig out: A block of markup, a block of CSS and some JavaScript that may or may not lead to a trail of dependencies. Read these via the dev tools and most people will get it, no invisible elements that need understanding. \r\n\r\nBut imagine a floating 3D text input box in a VR world, there would be several meshes, each with materials and geometries. There would be timed animation loops to make a cursor flash and loaders for the fonts, groups and helper functions to position objects and create rounded corners. None of this code would be standard, it would all be bespoke and searching the function names would not necessarily render results. 3D has a lot of \"invisible\" elements and as such the process of learning Three.js from someone else's work is a slow arduous process of recreating the code in a local dev environment and chopping out bits until you find the crux of the bit you are interested in and then studying\/debugging and modifying that until you understand what's going on. \r\n\r\nAre people just not prepared for the amount of work and effort required to write WebGL? Are these low performing questions on SO just another symptom of the erosion of \"Front-end\" and \"Back-end\" as a skill separator? These days, you have to be scientific and forensically deconstruct client-side code rather than just copy & paste bits until your page looks right. They are having to be proper developers for the first time in their careers and a lot of them won't like it! \r\n\r\nSo, as we clean up the Three.js tag on StackOverflow should the first question be _\"Is this about a general 3D technique rather than Three.js specifics?\"_ ...and if so... _\"Where do we move it to?\"_.  Should we be really harsh in closing questions that are genuinely inquisitive and interesting but contain no Three.js code? Does StackExchange need to create a platform for general 3D techniques that we can migrate these questions to? They have platforms for Blender https:\/\/blender.stackexchange.com\/ and 3D printing https:\/\/3dprinting.stackexchange.com\/, why not one for VR?

There are many ways to solve that problem, and some of them can be done with three. Generating procedural geometry is definitely something that can be done with three and is worth an explanation. My answer is mainly WebGL based, but it's still being used in conjunction with three. Ie. getting the GL context from three, and using it alongside it is a valid use case for the library. If anything I'd tag it with `webgl` because it can be solved by using a general graphics approach? I'd keep three though, i wouldnt make that question only about mesh processing or rendering algorithms. \r\n\r\n[There is a graphics stack overflow,\r\n](https:\/\/computergraphics.stackexchange.com\/) which seems to be doing better than that shortlived 3d one :( But moving all three stuff there if it's even possible would be overkill.","created_at":"2017-10-09T22:10:54.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12342#issuecomment-335304225","id":335304225,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12342","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTMwNDIyNQ==","updated_at":"2017-10-09T22:13:09.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/335304225","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/4681282?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/pailhead","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODEyODI=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"pailhead","type":"User","id":4681282,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/orgs"}},{"index":13,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"The gamedev stackoverflow is usually pretty decent as well, and a lot of questions are about 3D engines: https:\/\/gamedev.stackexchange.com","created_at":"2017-10-10T13:04:34.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12342#issuecomment-335465549","id":335465549,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12342","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTQ2NTU0OQ==","updated_at":"2017-10-10T13:05:04.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/335465549","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/cecilemuller\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/cecilemuller\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/681420?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/cecilemuller","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/cecilemuller\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/cecilemuller","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/cecilemuller\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTQyMA==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/cecilemuller\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/cecilemuller\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/cecilemuller\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"cecilemuller","type":"User","id":681420,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/cecilemuller\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/cecilemuller\/orgs"}},{"index":14,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"> 3D graphics attracts a lot of beginners who neither have the math skills nor the programming skills to handle these APIs.\r\n\r\nLike bugs attracted to bright lights. \ud83d\ude06 ","created_at":"2017-12-07T20:50:02.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12342#issuecomment-350090236","id":350090236,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12342","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDA5MDIzNg==","updated_at":"2017-12-07T20:50:02.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/350090236","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/297678?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/trusktr","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NzY3OA==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"trusktr","type":"User","id":297678,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trusktr\/orgs"}}]}
