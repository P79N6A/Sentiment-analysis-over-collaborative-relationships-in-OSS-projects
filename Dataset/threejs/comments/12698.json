Of course a compatibility overview is a useful thing and might be good orientation especially for beginners.\r\n\r\nHowever, i do not vote for an \"official\" detailed compatibility overview since it is a lot of work to maintain a comprehensive document. Right now, it is already hard for the core contributors to keep the project fairly up to date. I do not like the idea to document even more stuff.\r\n\r\nBesides, i see some critical statements in your post:\r\n\r\n> three.js supports most modern browsers, including Internet Explorer 9 and above.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid this statement is misleading and produces wrong expectations. From my point of view, IE9 is not supported. Microsoft users should use at least IE11, the better option is Edge.\r\n\r\n> If you still need to support IE9, it's a good choice to use CanvasRenderer.\r\n\r\nNo sorry, this is not a good choice. `CanvasRenderer` only supports a small subset of `WebGLRenderer`'s features.\r\n\r\n> ECMAScript Language Features or Web APIs Used in three.js\r\n\r\nYou've missed some JavaScript APIs that are actually used in the core like `WebAudio`. Besides, `requestAnimationFrame` is not only used in `WebGLRenderer` but e.g. in `VideoTexture`. Other API's that are used in the examples like `PointerLock`, `TextDecoder` or `fetch` are also not mentioned.","created_at":"2017-11-19T11:36:01.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12698#issuecomment-345509955","id":345509955,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12698","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NTUwOTk1NQ==","updated_at":"2017-11-19T11:56:25.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/345509955","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/12612165?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mugen87","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Mugen87","type":"User","id":12612165,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/orgs"}},{"index":1,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"I agree with @Mugen87.
