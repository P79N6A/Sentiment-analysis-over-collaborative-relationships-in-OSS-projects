I also do not know the answers to many of your questions. When I do, I do my best to answer them. Intonation does not translate well in text. My intention is to be polite. Please give me the benefit of the doubt.

Not relevant to the render calls that the renderer does (drawing) but relevant to what it does automagically by creating the geometries on the gpu. Anyhow, this probably makes the level of breadcrumbs i can live with :)\r\n\r\nAnd thanks for trying to understand where i come from, i think i'm trying to improve a process, or at least understand it better.\r\n\r\n>I did not close your PR.\r\n\r\nJust to clarify, i wasn't referring to the other PR but a fictional PR which would be made just to ask a question.
