Since there is no synchronization between the video frames and the frame limiting, its not unexpected that you might end missing a frame sometimes. You would probably need to set the frame limit to slightly higher than the video framerate (or accept that you may sometimes be a frame behind). This is obviously not ideal, but neither is submitting the texture at 90FPS for a 30FPS video so it might still be a useful feature (maybe off by default?) until we come up with something better.\r\n\r\nAlso, how were you able to debug the texture being a frame behind?","created_at":"2018-02-20T21:52:53.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/13305#issuecomment-367132929","id":367132929,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/13305","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzEzMjkyOQ==","updated_at":"2018-02-20T21:52:53.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/367132929","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/netpro2k\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/netpro2k\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/130735?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/netpro2k","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/netpro2k\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/netpro2k","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/netpro2k\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDczNQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/netpro2k\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/netpro2k\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/netpro2k\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"netpro2k","type":"User","id":130735,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/netpro2k\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/netpro2k\/orgs"}},{"index":1,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"> Also, how were you able to debug the texture being a frame behind?\r\n\r\nOh, the issue was not it was one frame behind.
