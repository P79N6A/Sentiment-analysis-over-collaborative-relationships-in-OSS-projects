I had some reservations as to whether to document these or not, but in the end I figured that everything visible to the user (except for _privateVariables) should be documented. \r\n\r\nIf you think the wording should be changed though it wouldn't be too much effort. \r\n\r\nAs a side note, ```Object.AssignProperties``` is used very minimally throughout the code (mainly just for IDs) - would it be a good idea use it for more properties that can't be changed without breaking things? Such as ```isXxx```, ```Material.lights``` and so on.\r\n\r\nIf things are defined that way (with ```writable``` and ```configurable``` set to false) then I think it would be OK to leave them out of the docs.
