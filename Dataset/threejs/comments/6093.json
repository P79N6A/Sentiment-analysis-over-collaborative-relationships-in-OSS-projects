You can reproduce it with this example: https:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/f2Lommf5\/3446\/\r\n\r\n- Hold down the mouse button (you have to do this within the first two seconds while the controls are enabled) and change the camera.\r\n- When the controls are disabled, the camera won't change its transformation anymore. Release the mouse button.\r\n- After two seconds, the controls are enabled again. You can still change the camera without holding down the mouse button.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that disabled `OrbitControls` don't process the `mouseup` event. This leads to a situation where the controls are somewhat out of sync with the input device. Should we maybe perform some kind of reset when the controls are disabled?","created_at":"2018-03-19T19:46:40.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6093#issuecomment-374345856","id":374345856,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6093","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDM0NTg1Ng==","updated_at":"2018-03-19T19:48:09.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/374345856","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/12612165?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mugen87","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Mugen87","type":"User","id":12612165,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/orgs"}},{"index":1,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I expect this will work:\r\n```javascript\r\ncontrols.enabled = false;\r\ncontrols.dispose();\r\n```\r\n.. but the use case seems unusual to me.","created_at":"2018-03-19T21:00:03.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6093#issuecomment-374374723","id":374374723,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6093","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDM3NDcyMw==","updated_at":"2018-03-19T21:00:03.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/374374723","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1000017?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/WestLangley","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDAwMTc=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"WestLangley","type":"User","id":1000017,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/WestLangley\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> .. but the use case seems unusual to me.\r\n\r\nYeah it feels a little bit...artificial.\r\n\r\n> controls.dispose();\r\n\r\nIf I call `.dispose()` and then enable the controls again, i'm unable to control the camera like before.
