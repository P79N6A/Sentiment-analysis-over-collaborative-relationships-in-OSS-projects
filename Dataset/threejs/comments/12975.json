Couldn't root.children[2] be a SkinnedMesh, and we'd still want to check its bones too?

Would be nice to avoid adding an extra bit of API.\r\n\r\nAbout this PR, I just wanna follow the current `PropertyBinding` rule, that is find node and then find bone  from the skeleton of the node. (findNode() goes down the graph and searches its children so I couldn't use.)\r\n\r\nAbout the reason why we don't go down the graph for bone search, I guess there may be the demand for clearly specifying bone node in a target node's skeleton? In general, (perhaps) bone's name is unique in a skeleton but two or more objects in a scene graph can have the same name. Besides that (also perhaps in general) one skinning animation clip expects to be applied to a skeleton, not to be applied to across two or more skeletons. If we go down, occasionally we could find unexpected node or bone from other nodes.","created_at":"2017-12-28T05:17:07.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/12975#issuecomment-354230308","id":354230308,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12975","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NDIzMDMwOA==","updated_at":"2017-12-28T05:25:48.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/354230308","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/7637832?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/takahirox","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2Mzc4MzI=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"takahirox","type":"User","id":7637832,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Ok, agreed let's not go down the graph with bone search then, at least not in this PR.\r\n\r\nFor the second part, I still think you could call `findNode` a second time instead of creating `findBone`, because (1) we already know `trackNode` is a skinned mesh, (2) we already know the bone exists, and (3) `findNode()` will exit early in that case.","created_at":"2017-12-28T05:33:14.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/12975#issuecomment-354231670","id":354231670,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12975","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NDIzMTY3MA==","updated_at":"2017-12-28T05:33:14.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/354231670","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> (2) we already know the bone exists,\r\n\r\nHow can we know the target bone (= its name is `trackBinding.objectIndex`) exists beforehand?","created_at":"2017-12-28T05:38:40.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/12975#issuecomment-354232149","id":354232149,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12975","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NDIzMjE0OQ==","updated_at":"2017-12-28T05:44:43.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/354232149","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/7637832?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/takahirox","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2Mzc4MzI=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"takahirox","type":"User","id":7637832,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/takahirox\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Assuming the AnimationClip is valid, that would have to be true wouldn't it?
