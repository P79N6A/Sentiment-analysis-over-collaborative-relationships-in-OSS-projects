As you can see at the following fiddle, you can't just change the type from `Array` to `Map` without break code (e.g. `Map` has no `length` property).\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/67pLdfwt\/\r\n\r\nI think it's better when your chances to `SVGLoader` are perform on app level.","created_at":"2018-11-03T11:22:31.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/15170#issuecomment-435580208","id":435580208,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/15170","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTU4MDIwOA==","updated_at":"2018-11-03T11:23:17.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/435580208","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/12612165?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mugen87","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Mugen87","type":"User","id":12612165,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/orgs"}},{"index":1,"author_association":"NONE","body":"@Mugen87 You're right, I feel a bit silly for missing some obvious cases when I did this, I rushed through it a bit too quickly and was only too focused on my own usage of it.\r\n\r\nI still think being able to reference the original nodes with the paths is an important feature here, so I've made a new commit which changes the behaviour back to the original way of returning an array of `ShapePath` as the first argument to the `onLoad` function, but I added the Map (now paths -> nodes) as a second argument, making it's usage optional.","created_at":"2018-11-03T16:15:37.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/15170#issuecomment-435600071","id":435600071,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/15170","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNTYwMDA3MQ==","updated_at":"2018-11-03T16:15:37.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/435600071","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/blakemann\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/blakemann\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/4955976?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/blakemann","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/blakemann\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/blakemann","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/blakemann\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTU5NzY=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/blakemann\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/blakemann\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/blakemann\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"blakemann","type":"User","id":4955976,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/blakemann\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/blakemann\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"I
