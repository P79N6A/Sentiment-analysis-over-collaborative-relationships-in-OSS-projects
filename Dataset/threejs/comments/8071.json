Didn't notice before. However that leads to some inconsistent package contents:\nWhen installing from the npm repository (`npm install three`), you get this package contents, resulting form the npm build.js script:\n\n```\nREADME.md\nexamples\npackage.json\nsrc\nthree.js\nthree.min.js\n```\n\nHowever when referencing a git branch\/commit (`npm install mrdoob\/three.js#dev`, which is what I did in my project), you get (matching the file structure in the git repo):\n\n```\nCONTRIBUTING.md\nLICENSE\nREADME.md\nbower.json\nbuild\nexamples\npackage.json\n```\n\nAnd apparently `three.js` in the first case is not the same as `build\/three.js`in the second, as it has the header.js and footer.js added during the npm build step, which is missing when having npm pull the package content directly from git...\n\nIs there a reason for that, or wouldn't it be possible to have the normal build produce a file which is suitable for npm as well (just adding the module.exports stuff), and `npm publish` directly from the root?\n\nAnyway, back to my case: as I was pulling the package from git (was using dev features), I was getting a different package, which is missing the src folder, because it is excluded in the `.npmignore` on the root folder, see https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/blob\/master\/.npmignore#L3\n\nAny objections to remove that exclusion from `.npmignore` (and likewise from `bower.json`)?\n","created_at":"2016-02-09T00:57:16.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8071#issuecomment-181649707","id":181649707,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8071","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MTY0OTcwNw==","updated_at":"2016-02-09T00:57:16.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/181649707","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/simonihmig\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/simonihmig\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1325249?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/simonihmig","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/simonihmig\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/simonihmig","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/simonihmig\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjUyNDk=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/simonihmig\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/simonihmig\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/simonihmig\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"simonihmig","type":"User","id":1325249,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/simonihmig\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/simonihmig\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@simonihmig I am fine with whatever you want to do as long as it works for everyone -- I am okay pulling in more into the npm module to make people's lives easier -- the only issue is that we do not a huge package to be downloaded -- so I would really not like to include all of \/examples as it contains 200MB of binary assets.\n\nPlease submit a PR for the build.js script and we can use that to generate the new modules.\n\nStrange thought: Would it be even possible to have the npm module pull in github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js directly as a submodule so that the npm module for three is a shim?
