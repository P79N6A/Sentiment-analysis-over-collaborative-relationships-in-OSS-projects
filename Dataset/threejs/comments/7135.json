Wouh. I have worked on side projects for 2 weeks because of that. It seems many people also get stuck on what can be called the \"Blender JSON exporter's checklist\" : https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6050, two more that I remember but cannot find now, the present one, and on stackoverflow : [here](http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/32685987\/getting-animation-to-render-correctly-with-three-js-objectloader?noredirect=1#comment53243030_32685987), [here](http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/18752146\/blender-exports-a-three-js-animation-bones-rotate-strangely?rq=1), [here](http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/24930115\/after-loading-a-model-exported-from-blender-in-three-js-skeleton-animations-are?rq=1), [here](http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/19565358\/angles-of-skeletalbone-animation-in-three-js-is-slightly-incorrect?rq=1), [here](http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/31062583\/three-js-animation-from-blender?rq=1), [here](http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/30350532\/blender-makehuman-to-three-js?rq=1), [here](http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/29970791\/animate-makehuman-character-with-bvh-using-three-js?rq=1), [here](http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/29678123\/trouble-with-blender-exporter-for-three-js) with a quick search.\n\nThe main rules are :\n- To use the last version of the exporter,\n- The mesh must be selected, animation or not ! \n- For animated meshes, all vertices must be attached to a bone (that answers the present issue), \n- For animated meshes, bones' location\/rotation\/scale must be reset **in pose mode**.\n\nWhile the three first rules can be randomly found in few moments (for more clever people than me), most of the issues and questions are caused by the position\/location\/scale not being reset, or people not doing it in pose mode. \n\nThis is a short version of what was first written at https:\/\/devmatrix.wordpress.com\/2013\/02\/27\/creating-skeletal-animation-in-blender-and-exporting-it-to-three-js\/. I am not sure that all those rules are exactly the same now, more experienced people or the exporter's author(s) could confirm. For example https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6567 also teaches that `ShaderMaterial` breaks animations because they are done through a vertex shader.\n\nSince the solutions are duplicated in at least three github issues with this one, three SO answers and this website, it would be usefull to have them all in an official place. That could be the exporter's readme and\/or in the docs, in the JSONLoader part, where people may be going on first place. And\/or any better place.\n","created_at":"2015-09-21T17:26:18.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7135#issuecomment-142049345","id":142049345,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7135","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MjA0OTM0NQ==","updated_at":"2015-09-23T08:12:34.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/142049345","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/10037511?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Astrak","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDM3NTEx","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Astrak","type":"User","id":10037511,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Seems like this was caused by the Blender JSON exporter and could be closed here?","created_at":"2018-01-16T19:04:52.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7135#issuecomment-358070020","id":358070020,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7135","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODA3MDAyMA==","updated_at":"2018-01-16T19:04:52.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/358070020","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maciek134\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maciek134\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1146309?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maciek134","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maciek134\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/maciek134","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maciek134\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDYzMDk=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maciek134\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maciek134\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maciek134\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"maciek134","type":"User","id":1146309,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maciek134\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/maciek134\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Definitely. i should have closed the issue long ago","created_at":"2018-01-16T20:58:43.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7135#issuecomment-358103158","id":358103158,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7135","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1ODEwMzE1OA==","updated_at":"2018-01-16T20:58:43.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/358103158","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/10037511?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Astrak","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDM3NTEx","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Astrak","type":"User","id":10037511,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Astrak\/orgs"}}]}
