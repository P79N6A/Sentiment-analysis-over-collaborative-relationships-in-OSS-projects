It is possible to make a similar move with both of them, but doing a move with one and doing the opposite move with the other doesn't cancle out.\r\nLets say you are zoomed in 95% to your target, then pan away from it and then try zoom back in to it you won't succeed. Right now this control can't be used to for e.g. to pan freely over a map.
