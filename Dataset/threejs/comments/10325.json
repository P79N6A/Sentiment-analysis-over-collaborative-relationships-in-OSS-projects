It was more about the over-structuring of a forum that is just getting started. My concern of a dead forum is simply that it gives a poor impression to potential users (and thus, growing the community). The best mitigation toward that would be to not overdo the number of sections initially; more can be added as they are needed later. I would say a simple 3-4 areas would be all that's required. One for Official News, one for Help\/Tutorials, one for Projects, and a simple Everything Else\/Off-topic.\r\n\r\nRegarding reddit; being \"mildly active\" just meant that while it's not completely dead there's not a lot of daily activity right now. My own opinion of reddit is that it might be a useful community site for sharing projects, but the flat structure is definitely non-ideal for more organization or storage of things like tutorials, etc for future reference. Reddit tends to direct focus to \"what's new and popular\" for the subreddits. Additionally, none of that addresses the ramifications of hosting your community on an entirely third-party site either. Caution is advised when doing so because you are at the mercy of their longevity and agreeableness to your purposes.
