These matrices are updated based on a **custom algorithm which includes a shear component** in the matrices (I know, you can't specify a shear in Three JS directly, but this is irrelevant here, as the matrices are computed outside of Three JS).\r\n\r\nAlright, now I want to iterate on the development on this script.
