It's easy to fix the mesh, but applying transforms on the Armature causes the mesh to be horribly distorted. As a general rule, make sure you don't scale or rotate your rig or bones. It's just a good best practice for rigging in general to do this.\n\nNow, on to the exporter issues...\n\nI'm fairly certain this issue existed before my pull request. I just tried r75 with the newest marine model included in pull request #8410 and I got this:\n\n![image](https:\/\/cloud.githubusercontent.com\/assets\/3812933\/14324599\/41ad03c8-fbda-11e5-9638-4aeb3865d64d.png)\n\nSimilar results with the exporter on the dev branch just before my PR:\n\n![image](https:\/\/cloud.githubusercontent.com\/assets\/3812933\/14325350\/c0d2e584-fbdd-11e5-8303-7726022cf56a.png)\n\nThen I tried the newest dev exporter with my change:\n\n![image](https:\/\/cloud.githubusercontent.com\/assets\/3812933\/14324690\/ae3375ae-fbda-11e5-8c34-316295951638.png)\n\nAfter r69 the exporter was completely changed and the way it's grabbing vert transforms is a little different. Previously transforms seemed to be using world space, but now they're transformed using a matrix. Perhaps when a model or armature is scaled the transform matrix doesn't take that into account, and since skinned verts need the bone transforms to be transformed correctly, it might explain the results. Maybe ping @repsac, one of the original authors, to see if he has any thoughts.\n\n> It'd be super awesome if we could automate these steps somehow. I don't think we should settle with having a secret science of model export. \n\nAgreed. I suspect that's what the 'Rest' option was for in the previous exporter. However, that wasn't working either so I removed it until that feature can be added.\n\n@rnixik I'm still curious to know which version of the exporter was used to get accurate results. Were you using the JSONLoader? With the newest exporter we were able to use the newest THREE with the ObjectLoader for skinned meshes.

Try applying the scale to your mesh to see if that fixes it.\n\nIs your Armature scaled? Try applying the scale on the Armature. At this point you may need to re-weight.\n\nAre your individual bones scaled? Try applying the scale on the bones.

Make sure you try that.\n\nThe bind pose is important because there has to be a starting transform for all verts and bones from which to transform. For example, if you move the right arm up, what does that mean? It needs to know what the starting point of the verts are so it can know where to move them when the arm goes up.\n\nSo If the bind pose is wrong, the starting point for your animation is wrong. \n","created_at":"2016-10-25T16:38:43.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8511#issuecomment-256089705","id":256089705,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8511","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjA4OTcwNQ==","updated_at":"2016-10-25T16:38:43.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/256089705","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/phfatmonkey\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/phfatmonkey\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/3812933?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/phfatmonkey","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/phfatmonkey\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/phfatmonkey","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/phfatmonkey\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MTI5MzM=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/phfatmonkey\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/phfatmonkey\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/phfatmonkey\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"phfatmonkey","type":"User","id":3812933,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/phfatmonkey\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/phfatmonkey\/orgs"}},{"index":23,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi where i can find tutorials on that specific actions in blender ? sorry i'm a programmer and not a 3d modeller\n","created_at":"2016-10-27T08:59:28.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8511#issuecomment-256586231","id":256586231,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8511","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjU4NjIzMQ==","updated_at":"2016-10-27T08:59:28.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/256586231","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trumanus\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trumanus\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/3648370?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trumanus","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trumanus\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/trumanus","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trumanus\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDgzNzA=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trumanus\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trumanus\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trumanus\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"trumanus","type":"User","id":3648370,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trumanus\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/trumanus\/orgs"}},{"index":24,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"There's a ton of Blender Tutorials out there, a simple Google search yields pages of them.
