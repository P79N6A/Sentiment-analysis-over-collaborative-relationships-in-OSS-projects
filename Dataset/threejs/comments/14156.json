Of course, in case of `JSONLoader` my `Promise` will never be solved so I have to parse my `.json` objects in a different way.\r\n\r\nI actually had this issue and I agree: it's a bit stupid as real problem (that's why mine is just a suggestion), but the point is that different loaders are inconsistent. I suppose this is because `JSONLoader` is one of the oldest and its `parse` method has linear flow (no async functions); JSON file is parsed right after that method is called.\r\n\r\nAbout \r\n\r\n> JSONLoader returns before textures have loaded\r\n\r\nI'm not sure, but it's possible.

I'm just a little bit surprised about the mentioned warning. This should not happen since `TextureLoader.load()` ensures that `texture.needsUpdate` is only set to `true` if the corresponding image has actually loaded.
