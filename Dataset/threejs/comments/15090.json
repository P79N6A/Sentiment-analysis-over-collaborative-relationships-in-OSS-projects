GLTF is already much faster to parse than OBJ, and the design choices it uses to accomplish that are the same choices you'd need to make, again, to send mesh data back from the Web Worker.\r\n\r\nBut for certain parts of the parsing process, like Draco decompression, Web Workers would be a great addition. I'd welcome a PR for that, but would recommend discussing the API first.\r\n\r\nIf you have a specific example where parsing is not as fast as you'd like, please feel free to share it and we can consider the options. :)","created_at":"2018-10-19T18:55:57.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/15090#issuecomment-431463709","id":431463709,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/15090","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzMTQ2MzcwOQ==","updated_at":"2018-10-19T18:58:41.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/431463709","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> But for certain parts of the parsing process, like Draco decompression, Web Workers would be a great addition.\r\n\r\nSince we already have #13648 for this, I think it's better to close the issue.
