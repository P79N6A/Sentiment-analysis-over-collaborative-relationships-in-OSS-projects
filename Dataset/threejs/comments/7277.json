One of the big things in Mechanics VS games, is that the design is not changed specifically to suit the display. In my case, I have a huge number of polylines whose vertex count is very volatile, some of them are just one segment and some of them are a few thousands vertices. As a first implementation I simply created one Three.js object per polyline and moved on, but I quickly reached limits, where the uploads of the bufferedgeometries would block the main thread which would block the USB communication long enough to starve of data the executor, which would make a hiccup in the stepper motors, which would lead to a step loss which would lead to scraping the part and time lost.\n\nTo regularize a bit the rendering time, my idea is to pack everything in a few BufferedGeometries of 10000 vertices in the position attribute (if I cross the border in the middle of a polyline, I can just repeat the last vertex of the full attribute in the first position of the new one). Then I have 2 methods to split those vertices in the original polylines: either I make an index buffer segment by segment (and the number of polylines has completely disappeared form the complexity of drawing, we only pay a price per vertex), or I make one drawcall per polyline (then I don't need the indices buffers,  but it's a bit risky to have a drawcall count the same as the number of polylines).\n\nhere is the state of my mind.\n\nOf course, things change every day, I'm currently splitting some work preparatory to display into a separate worker, and sending the attribute buffers back to the main thread into a transferable for example, in the hope to make the display work a bit \"choppier\" and the USB has more chances to pass some stuff on a regular basis.\n","created_at":"2015-10-05T21:20:43.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7277#issuecomment-145671635","id":145671635,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7277","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NTY3MTYzNQ==","updated_at":"2015-10-05T21:20:43.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/145671635","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/nraynaud\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/nraynaud\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/46941?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/nraynaud","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/nraynaud\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/nraynaud","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/nraynaud\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2OTQx","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/nraynaud\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/nraynaud\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/nraynaud\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"nraynaud","type":"User","id":46941,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/nraynaud\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/nraynaud\/orgs"}},{"index":7,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"Does the current code works for your use case?\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/blob\/master\/src\/renderers\/WebGLRenderer.js#L814-L840\n","created_at":"2015-11-02T22:38:36.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7277#issuecomment-153180372","id":153180372,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7277","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzE4MDM3Mg==","updated_at":"2015-11-02T22:38:36.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/153180372","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/97088?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDg4","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"mrdoob","type":"User","id":97088,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/orgs"}},{"index":8,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"This is a very easy change if we want it:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nsetDrawRange: function ( start, count ) {\r\n\r\n  console.warn( 'THREE.BufferGeometry: .setDrawRange() is deprecated.
