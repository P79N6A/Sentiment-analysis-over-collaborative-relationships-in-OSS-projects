Sorry for my late response. I wanted to provide you with a decent and helpful answer and wanted to look further into the exporter for that, but could't find the time and I'm afraid I'm not able very soon either. So for now my 2 cents:\r\n\r\nI agree with @manthrax : it would be better to have a 1-to-1 export then to have an inconsistent export. Adding to this the locations of lights aren't exported correctly (or not at all?). I set these everytime by code after importing a scene from blender, and that feels silly and gives the exporter an unreliable feel. Especially because the behaviour seems to change after time when version changes.\r\n\r\nAlso other, to my opinion very importing things, like focus points of spotlights, are not exported, because these are marked out in the exporer-code. Can't really understand why, but could it be this all has got something to do with wanting to convert axis from blender to three too? So maybe this would also be solved when there would be a 1-to-1 export. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately I don't have time these days to help you with this, although I would like to, 'cause a better blender exporter is high on my list and I'm using it a lot, so sorry for this. But if you like my opinion:\r\nhaving a reliable 1-to-1 export for all objects in the scene (including lights, cameras etc.) would be better then what the exporter is doing now, having to do all kind of corrections 'by hand' after import.\r\nKeep up the good work!

up!","created_at":"2017-07-24T12:08:27.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10804#issuecomment-317402272","id":317402272,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10804","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzQwMjI3Mg==","updated_at":"2017-07-24T12:08:27.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/317402272","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Friksel\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Friksel\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/3089978?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Friksel","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Friksel\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Friksel","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Friksel\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODk5Nzg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Friksel\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Friksel\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Friksel\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Friksel","type":"User","id":3089978,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Friksel\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Friksel\/orgs"}},{"index":16,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mrdoob:\r\n\r\nI've

The axes should not be swapped. The axes should just be rotated by a quarter-turn.\r\n3. Remove all the code in the exporter that does any kind of coordinate swapping, and get the new exporter to work properly as a pass-through. @Mugen87 has developed a utility (#11540) that will rotate a scene. The 1\/4-turn rotation can be applied in the loader callback as a temporary measure.\r\n4.
