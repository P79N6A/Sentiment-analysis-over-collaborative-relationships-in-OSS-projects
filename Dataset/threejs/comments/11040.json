But to be honest, i don't know all parts of `WebGLRenderer` in detail. If there is a smart solution to do this, i'm of course open to it. But currently it seems to me, that the code in  `WebGLRenderer` will be more complicated if we mix the rendering of line primitives and screen-space projected lines.\r\n\r\nTherefore i would propose something different :sweat_smile:. \r\n\r\n`Line`, `LineLoop` and `LineSegments` should be exclusively used for rendering line primitives. Because the usage of `gl.lineWidth()` is not reliable ([reference](https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/API\/WebGLRenderingContext\/lineWidth)), i would remove `linewidth` from `LineBasicMaterial` and `LineDashedMaterial` and render all line primitives with the default line width of `1`. If users still apply `linewidth > 1` to a `Line*` material, `three.js` could log a warning to use `MeshLine` in combination with `MeshBasicMaterial` instead.","created_at":"2017-03-21T21:48:29.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/11040#issuecomment-288229832","id":288229832,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11040","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4ODIyOTgzMg==","updated_at":"2017-03-21T21:48:29.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/288229832","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/12612165?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mugen87","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Mugen87","type":"User","id":12612165,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> So if THREE.Line's linewidth > 1 then WebGLRenderer uses this code.
