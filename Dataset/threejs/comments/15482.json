I even made a PR on @arodic's branch to convert the `OBJLoader`.  So first, I wanted to say thanks for joining in the conversation and considering this.  \r\n\r\nIt's not clear what the outcome is here, clearly the PR is dead but you say \"better to keep both modules and non-modules for now\", so is the plan (e.g. for Loaders) to keep duplicate copies of the source in both module and non-module form?  \r\n\r\nIf that's the case then I wonder if there's a way forward on this that doesn't cause the code to diverge between the two versions (modular vs not) of the same file.   I had the impression here that @arodic was doing this PR somewhat manually, but there was some discussion about automating it, so perhaps there's a way to do the conversion automatically in such a way that when a bugfix is made to the main (non-modular) version, it gets propagated automatically to the modular script by running the automated conversion.  \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if @ltee from the `three-full` repo has been part of these discussions in the past or if he's just doing his own thing on the side, but he appears to have some stuff [NodeJS scripts](https:\/\/github.com\/Itee\/js-to-es\/blob\/master\/sources\/js-to-es.js) for this,  ([discussion](https:\/\/github.com\/Itee\/three-full\/issues\/1)).

However, having two versions in `examples\/`(source) is a little bit confusing and similar idea was rejected before when discussing #14447 (shaderchunks to ES6 modules). I think it would make more sense to have examples(source) in ES6 module format and then have a build step that generate say `three.examples.js` same like the rest of three.js codebase.
