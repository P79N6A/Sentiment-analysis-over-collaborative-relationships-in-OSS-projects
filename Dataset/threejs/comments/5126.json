The objective here is to obtain both an interactive 3d visualization that I can show on screen and a vector graphics snapshot of that visualization to include in a print publication. Here, threejs has been extremely useful as I can do both from a single code base. (Most existing 3d plotting tools, such as the one in Sage, force me to rasterize the output, which is undesirable for print publications and unnecessary since I am only using simple line-drawings - no shaders whatsoever.) Moreover, getting SVG output is extremely convenient as I can edit the result in Inkscape.\n\nSo far, the only primitives I needed were lines and polygons, so the existing SVGRenderer was perfectly sufficient for my purposes. Now, I want to add a bunch of points to the visualization which I would like to represent as SVG circles. \n\nI have tried using both SphereGeometry and CircleGeometry meshes instead, but the results are less than satisfactory. Spheres slow down the SVG rendering to the point of being unusable, due to the large number of triangles created. Circles work better, but the triangles into which the circles are subdivided produce unnecessary artifacts in the final SVG image and I have to take care to align the circles with the plane of projection. Using particles seems like the perfect solution, as no explosion in the number of triangles takes place and camera-alignment is handled automatically. Only, instead of texture-mapped squares, I'd like to have circles in the SVG output.\n","created_at":"2014-07-29T10:47:30.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/5126#issuecomment-50461191","id":50461191,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/5126","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNDYxMTkx","updated_at":"2014-07-29T10:47:30.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/50461191","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fbreuer\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fbreuer\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/104177?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fbreuer","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fbreuer\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/fbreuer","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fbreuer\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDE3Nw==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fbreuer\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fbreuer\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fbreuer\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"fbreuer","type":"User","id":104177,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fbreuer\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/fbreuer\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"Yep, I understand.
