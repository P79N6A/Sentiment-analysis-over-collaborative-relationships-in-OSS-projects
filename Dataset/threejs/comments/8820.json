I guess fov and focal length\nare just the two values that express essentially the same thing but with\ndifferent units.\n\nWhat I found is that the blender to three.js exporter takes the value for\nfocal-length\/mm from blender and exports it as the FOV value for the\ncorresponding three.js camera.  So, for example, if I set fov = 60 in\nblender, that corresponds (if I toggle from fov to focal length for that\nfield) to a 34mm value, and what I get if I export to three.js is a camera\nwith a 34 FOV.  So, to see the scene as I make it in blender, I have to\nmanually reset the FOV of the blender-created camera to 60 when I get it\ninto three.js and update the projection matrix.\n\nCheers.\n\nOn Tue, Jul 5, 2016 at 5:32 AM, Benjamin Cid P\u00e9rez <notifications@github.com\n\n> wrote:\n> \n> I upgrade to r76 to fix another problem and all my exported blender scenes\n> no longer rendered right.\n> \n> Hi!

I should have read back to the beginning.\n\nIf you import a three.js scene from blender, the camera's matrix changes to\nimpose a coordinate system where Positive Z is UP and Positive X is LEFT.\nSo if I setup a camera, in blender at XYZ  <0 0 10> with no rotation\napplied, it imports into THREE.js at position XYZ <0 10 0> with a rotation\napplied on import to point the camera from its new position on the Y axis\nback toward the origin, I guess.\n\nMy guess is that you guys decided to import Blender's right-hand coordinate\nsystem directly instead of remapping everything to THREE.js's left-hand\ncoordinate system.  But that means that, if I use Blender in my workflow, I\nam committing to using two coordinate systems--one for Blender and one for\nTHREE.js--and translating between them.  So, for example, whenever I create\nan object in THREE.js and add it to a scene imported from blender, I have\nto be sure to position, rotate, and translate the new object, in THREE's\nleft-hand coordinate system, so that it is picked up by the camera\nreflecting a left-hand coordinate system and so it aligns with all the\nother objects imported from Blender.  The same goes for objects created for\nyour super-cool CSS3d renderer.  I have to create them and then 3d\ntransform them if I want them to align with Webgl objects imported from\nblender.\n\nSo I thought this was a bug, at first.  But maybe it is just a feature\nrequest.

Only changing from camera.lens to camera.angle will export fov as radians, so you need to transform inte degrees after importing to three.js. Or change the exporter. And I had trouble matching the cameras anyways. What seem to work for me was to set the sensor-size values vertical\/horizontal to the same value and disable \"auto\". Then my cameras end up the same in both blender and three.js. \r\n![screen shot 2018-04-04 at 09 48 25](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/946195\/38295264-b71bcaee-37ed-11e8-9f07-2718fea9b20d.png)\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-04T07:51:42.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8820#issuecomment-378512677","id":378512677,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8820","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3ODUxMjY3Nw==","updated_at":"2018-04-04T07:51:42.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/378512677","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/inear\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/inear\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/946195?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/inear","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/inear\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/inear","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/inear\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0NjE5NQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/inear\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/inear\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/inear\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"inear","type":"User","id":946195,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/inear\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/inear\/orgs"}},{"index":11,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"The JSON Blender exporter has been removed with `R93` (#14117). \r\n\r\nAlso see: https:\/\/threejs.org\/docs\/#manual\/introduction\/Loading-3D-models","created_at":"2018-05-31T09:12:43.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8820#issuecomment-393467544","id":393467544,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8820","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzQ2NzU0NA==","updated_at":"2018-05-31T09:12:43.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/393467544","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/12612165?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mugen87","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Mugen87","type":"User","id":12612165,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/orgs"}}]}
