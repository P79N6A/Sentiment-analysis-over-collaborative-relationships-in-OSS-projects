I dont know why we need another minified build.\r\n\r\nI've been experimenting with trying to bundle THREE with Closure Compiler and found it can only be done in SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS. Closure Compiler or Rollup doesnt seem to be able to treeshake THREE very well, it bundles the entire library producing a bundle that is 200Kb+ for a simple hello world app that rotates a cube (the example on the Github README). The bundle that includes all the parts of Angular required for this app without THREE is 34Kb.   \r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-26T21:31:12.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/9617#issuecomment-347040002","id":347040002,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/9617","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzA0MDAwMg==","updated_at":"2017-11-26T21:31:12.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/347040002","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/steveblue\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/steveblue\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1171943?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/steveblue","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/steveblue\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/steveblue","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/steveblue\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzE5NDM=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/steveblue\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/steveblue\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/steveblue\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"steveblue","type":"User","id":1171943,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/steveblue\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/steveblue\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"@zz85 should this be closed or newer versions `closure-compiler-js` produce comparable builds now?","created_at":"2017-11-27T07:33:33.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/9617#issuecomment-347100238","id":347100238,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/9617","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzEwMDIzOA==","updated_at":"2017-11-27T07:33:33.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/347100238","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/97088?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDg4","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"mrdoob","type":"User","id":97088,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@steveblue i think the original intent of this PR was build three.js with js only dependencies (and without java for closure). at the time, uglifyjs was an alternative, but google closure seemed to have better size results.\r\n\r\nit's been awhile since I've tried these tools, so i'll close the issue for now unless there's a greater interest in this.","created_at":"2018-02-09T01:52:04.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/9617#issuecomment-364310500","id":364310500,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/9617","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDMxMDUwMA==","updated_at":"2018-02-09T01:52:04.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/364310500","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zz85\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zz85\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/314997?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zz85","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zz85\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/zz85","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zz85\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNDk5Nw==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zz85\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zz85\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zz85\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"zz85","type":"User","id":314997,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zz85\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/zz85\/orgs"}}]}
