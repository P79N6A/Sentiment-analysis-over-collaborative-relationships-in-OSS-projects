I don't have the python skills to modify the exporter, but I hope it helps in recognizing the problem. Today I spent 6 hours on it (then I realized I had already spent the same amount of time a week ago and simply forgot how I solved this. So if the following doesn't help any one, consider it as a note-to-self):\n\nI make an action, which contains one frame, keyframed as same as the rest mode and export it with \"pose\" selected in exporter's settings. If don't do that, the pose is applied to _the posed form of_ the first frame. So it doubles the armature influence.\nThen I change the active action to each of the other animations, export individually, and replace them in the original file. btw, I couldn't get rest mode to work so that's why I used pose...\n\n> many people I have encountered rigged their assets based some random tutorial they found in google searches\n\nTrue, my model was from makehuman. That's why I think the rigging should have been pretty standard.\n\nBut I must say, the exporter does an amazing job in understanding all the influences.
