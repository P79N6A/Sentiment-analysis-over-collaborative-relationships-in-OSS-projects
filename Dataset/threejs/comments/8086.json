For instance, if you try to encode a `THREE.SphereGeometry` you will end-up with dozens of faces\/vertices\/indices, while you could just encode the constructor parameters (optimising for size). This was the idea behind the compile `profiles`.. keeping only the important properties on each parameter. \n\nAlso, you raised a very valid point! I didn't include date objects in the protocol! I got a bit carried away trying to optimise `TypedArrays`.\n\n> I wondered if the synergistic combo is more efficient or if one supersedes the other or which is better or what?\n\nThat might actually be true, as @theo-armour  reported on fast networks. And that's why I also tried to define a format for the raw resources (`.jbbsrc` used in the tests).  However I still think that just casting a binary blob to a `TypedArray` is faster than parsing it's JSON representation, but with the speed Javascript gets optimised I am not sure for the future :laughing: \n\n@theo-armour: Thanks for your test numbers! I was actually looking to find the weakest points of this format. Can you check in the `Network` tab of the developer's console and see if just the loading of the `.jbb`\/`.jbbp` takes longer? At least for the first 3 tests, I am positive that you can get a measurable benefit from TypedArrays. I bet that on fast networks you can load in parallel many more resources, and that's the reason behind these numbers.\n\nPerhaps a good  test is to try and load a bundle of many files rather than just a couple..\n","created_at":"2016-02-08T07:28:26.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8086#issuecomment-181236781","id":181236781,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8086","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MTIzNjc4MQ==","updated_at":"2016-02-08T07:29:59.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/181236781","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/wavesoft\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/wavesoft\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/883486?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/wavesoft","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/wavesoft\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/wavesoft","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/wavesoft\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MzQ4Ng==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/wavesoft\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/wavesoft\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/wavesoft\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"wavesoft","type":"User","id":883486,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/wavesoft\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/wavesoft\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Ah, @theo-armour can you also check if the `.jbb` and `.jbbp` files are served with `Content-Encoding: gzip`?
