That might align with a ~30min loss, but I'm guessing that you're seeing it more while users are actively playing a game, right? If so that sounds more like a slow GPU memory leak.\n\nIf you have the time please file a Chrome bug (http:\/\/crbug.com) about this, noting that you've seen an increase in context losses since 38 and providing any data you have that demonstrates the problem, along with links to pages that have proven problematic.
