Which is the same problem you have if you reverse the ideal sorting for transparency and render everything front to back. This still happens on the individual triangle level as they are painted one after another. \r\n\r\nYou might actually see it better if it was mirrored or from another side. If you were to break this mesh into individual triangles and let three sort them, it would be better but still could have issues depending on the shape. \r\n\r\nThe solve for this is not easy. Here's an example of one that works with three (but is slow) and another one that works with modified three.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/raw.githack.com\/pailhead\/three.js\/depth-peel-stencil\/examples\/webgl_materials_depthpeel.html\r\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/15312","created_at":"2019-01-01T00:59:58.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14456#issuecomment-450702716","id":450702716,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14456","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDcwMjcxNg==","updated_at":"2019-01-01T01:01:01.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/450702716","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/4681282?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/pailhead","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODEyODI=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"pailhead","type":"User","id":4681282,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/orgs"}}]}
