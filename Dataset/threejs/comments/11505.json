And looks like this will be a bit more tedious.  I can step through the various material pages as I find time and put notes in the aoMap and lightmap fields of each to reference the need for multiple UV sets; is there anywhere that UVs, and specifically, multiple sets of UVs, are independently documented to cite what they're used for from that end?  I've been over the Geometry and BufferGeometry sections, and the reference examples of the Version 3 and Version 4 json formats, but they don't say anything explicit.  I only even worked out that multiple UV sets were a thing, let alone that each additional UV set meant an additional triad would be parsed in the Version 3 Geometry spec (for so-flagged faces), by trial-and-erroring against files from a 3rd-party exporter.","created_at":"2017-06-14T14:17:26.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11505#issuecomment-308445390","id":308445390,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11505","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODQ0NTM5MA==","updated_at":"2017-06-14T14:17:26.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/308445390","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/28572171?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/NNskelly","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTcyMTcx","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"NNskelly","type":"User","id":28572171,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Since you are learning, I suggest you also learn your way around the source code.

By the time I've dug down through the 3rd-party tech stack the boss is enamored with, found THREE at the bottom (as an already minified lib), and tried to build up again from it and a bunch of assets artists have handed over from their \"normal\" process, I don't tend to have a lot of time left to dig into THREE itself. The result being that when the docs and any StackOverflow posts I can find newer than ~2012 don't line up with the behavior I observe, it's often faster to isolate a concrete repro citing the discrepancy than to do further digging and questioning \"intended\" vs documented behavior and hoping that someone else with a recognizably similar use case will come along with answers before I have to show results on my end.\r\n\r\nAnd hey, at least it's getting the clarifications made fairly quickly :)  As loud as I know I've been in the past few weeks, I'm definitely on board with leaving a better-paved road behind me for future explorers (it just, as alluded, might not be same-day when a dozen or more pages of docs want the same callouts)","created_at":"2017-06-14T16:52:05.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11505#issuecomment-308492253","id":308492253,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11505","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODQ5MjI1Mw==","updated_at":"2017-06-14T16:52:05.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/308492253","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/28572171?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/NNskelly","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTcyMTcx","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"NNskelly","type":"User","id":28572171,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/NNskelly\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Looking to add UV notes to the various material docs, I see UVs mentioned in the committed source but not yet or only partially reflected on the site.
