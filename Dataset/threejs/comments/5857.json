I don't mind at all if it's something I need to handle myself rather than three.js, just looking for some advice.\n\nMy main issue at the moment is IE11 is giving the following error under very specific circumstances (certain hardware):\n\n> WebGL is taking too long to render on your GPU. Temporarily switching to software rendering.\n\nOf course the context is lost when this happens so everything sort of hits the fan. Looking for a recovery mechanism if possible.\n\nMind you IE11 doing this at all is pretty infuriating. Rendering performance is about 2-3x faster with Chrome or Firefox on the very same machine! It's quite peculiar, unfortunately a major client happens to have a whole heap of machines in their office that all fail in this very fashion.\n","created_at":"2016-10-14T23:27:21.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/5857#issuecomment-253943166","id":253943166,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/5857","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Mzk0MzE2Ng==","updated_at":"2016-10-14T23:27:21.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/253943166","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/482276?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Benjamin-Dobell","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MjI3Ng==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Benjamin-Dobell","type":"User","id":482276,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Benjamin-Dobell\/orgs"}},{"index":5,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"Yeah, I should give priority to this...
