The fog fragment follows the encoding fragment.\r\n\r\nMy recollection is that since the clear color is not affected by output encoding, and one would normally want the fog color to match the clear color, fog is not affected either. This can be changed, of course.\r\n\r\n>`scene.background` is not affected by gammaOutput=true\r\n\r\nIt should be.

Now that I check the docs, it just sets clear color anyway, so that explains that. :)\r\n\r\nI won't suggest changing this, then. As we discuss an API to replace gammaInput\/gammaOutput, this behavior seems fine. I'll get inconsistent results when setting `#4285f4` on fog vs on a material in the scene, but if anything I think that's an argument to reconsider how color inputs to materials are handled, rather than changing this.\r\n\r\nThanks!","created_at":"2018-12-06T18:48:17.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/15382#issuecomment-444984281","id":444984281,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/15382","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0NDk4NDI4MQ==","updated_at":"2018-12-06T18:48:17.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/444984281","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}}]}
