This ensures the one \"frame\" where the jittering occurs, is immediately cancelled out on the next frame.\r\n\r\nSo basically (in psuedo since I'm currently in the office and don't have my code with me):\r\n```javascript\r\n\/\/ Keep track of mousemove delta:\r\nlet mouse_delta = {x: 0, y: 0};\r\n\r\ndocument.addEventListener('mousemove', (event) => {\r\n    mouse_delta.x = mouse_delta.x.lerp(event.mousemoveX, 100);\r\n    mouse_delta.y = mouse_delta.y.lerp(event.mousemoveY, 100);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nnote: `lerp(val, amount)` is a standard lerping function I've put onto `Number.prototype`.\r\n\r\nThis solution isn't perfect, but it helps quite a lot compared to not having this. You might need to fiddle a bit with the lerp value amount (the `100` in the example).\r\n\r\nUse `mouse_delta.x` and `mouse_delta.y` in your camera code instead of the raw input.\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-27T10:27:47.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12757#issuecomment-347140303","id":347140303,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12757","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzE0MDMwMw==","updated_at":"2017-11-27T10:29:29.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/347140303","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/haroldiedema\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/haroldiedema\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/567518?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/haroldiedema","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/haroldiedema\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/haroldiedema","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/haroldiedema\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzUxOA==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/haroldiedema\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/haroldiedema\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/haroldiedema\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"haroldiedema","type":"User","id":567518,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/haroldiedema\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/haroldiedema\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Closing since it's a browser issue. @haroldiedema Thanks for providing the link to the bug report :+1: \r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/bugs.chromium.org\/p\/chromium\/issues\/detail?id=781182","created_at":"2017-11-27T12:08:26.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12757#issuecomment-347163454","id":347163454,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12757","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzE2MzQ1NA==","updated_at":"2017-11-27T12:08:26.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/347163454","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/12612165?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mugen87","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Mugen87","type":"User","id":12612165,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/orgs"}}]}
