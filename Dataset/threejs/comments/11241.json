just got hit with this as well moving from r83 to r85.\r\n\r\nIf an object does a lookAt something else that lies along its own \"up\" vector, the result will be NaNs.. that then propagate through the pipeline resulting in the NaNs later throwing an exception in my  AudioListener.\r\n\r\nI agree with the choice to remove the isFinite check in divideScalar and adding a check in normalize() where the cost is already amortized somewhat by the cost of the sqrt.\r\n\r\nI'm adding this here in case the keywords help someone else figure out this problem.\r\n\r\nWhat helped me track down where this was happening was putting a bunch of  \"if( isNaN(value) )debugger;\" checks in the setters for Vector3, Euler, Quaternion, and Matrix4.\r\n\r\nAlso wanted to mention, there is a test inside Matrix4.lookAt that attempts to detect the case of \r\n\"\/\/ eye and target are in the same vertical\"\r\nAnd then nudge the \"z.z += 0.0001;\", in a attempt to fix the situation.. but this still fails if the lookAt is along the z axis, with an up vector of 0,0,1.\r\nSo maybe that logic could bear some scrutiny....\r\n\r\nI'm sort of wondering if it would be worthwhile to make some kind of debug mode that injects different getters and setters for those methods at runtime, and\/or does extra validation, based on a debug flag? I'm guessing probably not but, tracking down the source of those NaNs was a little painful.. and it's also interesting as a more general question... for instance some kind of lint-like debug mode for validating types and checking for NaNs\/Infinities, strings being passed in, etc. ;)\r\nIt would be neat to have an extra level of assurance that there aren't weird type conversions going on in the runtime... and I've seen some things like that in the wild in other peoples codebases...\r\nanyway, just thinking out loud.\r\n\r\nCheers!","created_at":"2017-06-02T01:50:43.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11241#issuecomment-305667279","id":305667279,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11241","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTY2NzI3OQ==","updated_at":"2017-06-02T01:50:43.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/305667279","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/350247?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/manthrax","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDI0Nw==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"manthrax","type":"User","id":350247,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/orgs"}},{"index":5,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":">but this still fails if the lookAt is along the z axis, with an up vector of 0,0,1.\r\n\r\nRight.

made a JSFiddle showing some of this new counterintuitive behavior, and also what seems like it might be a bug in DirectionalLightHelper as well...\r\n\r\nFirst I set Object3D.DefaultUp.set(0,0,1)\r\n\r\nThen I make a DirectionalLight, and a DirectionalLightHelper moving along the X axis, to eventually line up looking down the Z (DefaultUp) axis.\r\n\r\nAt the point that it is looking exactly down that axis, the DirectionalLightHelper breaks, and its values are full of NaNs...\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the DirectionalLightHelper, doesn't seem to be aiming down the correct axis that the light is pointing along...  I animate a cube at the halfway point between light and 0,0,0, to illustrate that point...\r\n\r\nAdditionally when the NaN problem kicks in, I check for it, and flash the cube...\r\n\r\nLet me know if any of this is unclear... of if I'm just using DirectionalLightHelper wrong?\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/5wgjvLnz\/19\/\r\n\r\nedit: Updated with new issues...
