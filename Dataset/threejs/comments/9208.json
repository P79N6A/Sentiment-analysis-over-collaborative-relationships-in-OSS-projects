> I'm sorry but why it hasn't been adopted?\n> \n> Why do you need to sort (opaque) objects by shader?\n\n@mrdumb, This is because of how a GPU works.\nThe following is a greatly simplified explanation (This is nowhere near a correct representation of the GPU nowadays.) to explain why it is nessecary based on webgl 1.0. \nA GPU has 3 core stages:\n- The vertex shader stage\n- The rasterisation stage\n- The fragment shader stage\n\n### How  to draw something\n\nWhen trying to draw something you will send info about the shape you want to draw.\nTo keep things simple we will try to draw  2 triangles based from 6 points.\n- The vertex shader stage is mainly used to find the position of the 6 points in the 2D canvas and the depth of a point based on the info given about the shape.\n- The rasterisation stage calculates the area used of the 3 points to get to the triangle and also the depth of the area based on the 3 points. This area is split in pixels. \n- The fragment shader stage is used to find the color of the pixels on the info given about the shape.\n\nWith this you will get a screen of 2 triangles.\n\n### Why sort\n\n#### Sorting based on depth\n\nAgain we will be using 2 triangles to draw. Let's assume that the 2 triangles have an overlapping area.\n\nLet's start with first by drawing the furthest triangle.\n- We draw the first triangle by using all 3 steps.\n- Then we draw the second triangle completely since it needs it is closer to the screen.\n\nLet's assume we now draw by using the closest triangle.\n- we draw the first triangle  by using all 3 steps.\n- Then we start drawing the second triangle by using the vertex shader stage and the rasterisation step. The rasterisation stage takes notice that a certain pixels are behind pixels that are already drawn. So it doesn't execute the fragment shader stage for the pixels in that area. \n\nThis means that when we are drawing from closest to furthest we have to do less calculation on the GPU.\n\n#### Sorting based on program\n\nIn webgl the vertex shader stage and fragment shader stage are programmable by programs. When we update these programs we call this a state switch in the GPU. A state switch is something that is slow because it completely reconfigures the GPU. So we try to avoid that also by sorting. \n\nKeep in mind that these rules only apply to opaque objects and this is a simplified example.
