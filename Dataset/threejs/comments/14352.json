The flat rectangle uses a buffer geometry with a 2D buffer attribute and is at a child leaf of the object hierarchy. I'd like to be able to compute a bounding box for an object like this (that is a combination of 2D and 3D shapes) using `Box3.setFromObject`, especially if this kind of object can be created from a loader (like `GLTFLoader`). I don't know actually know if those loaders would ever create a 2D buffer attribute, but I don't see why not.\r\n\r\nIn this fiddle example you'll also notice an error where the `BufferGeometry` I created fails to compute a bounding sphere.

The API is `Box3.expandByObject(object : Object3D) : Box3`, so there is actually nothing illegal in having funky attributes on your geometry, perhaps it was too ambitious to offer such a broad API, but it doesn't say anything about geometry or restrictions on such.\r\n\r\nPossible ways to address this:\r\n1. Update documentation of `expandByObject` to reflect that for `BufferGeometry` `position` attribute must be 3D\r\n2.
