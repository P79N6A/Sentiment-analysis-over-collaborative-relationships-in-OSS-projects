It's how I do it and how mine is working. It's a suggestion. Anyway I'm kind of a Socrates in these matters. Make people think again. And so I say take what you will from it or others can. I've low confidence my revisiting [THREE after a spell (back to noob status)] and modifications will be welcome based partly on previous experience. Also I am not sure it's right so feedback welcome I suppose.\r\n\r\n_I have adapted your extra spaces in all my code but not the extra lines. Thanks for that._\r\n\r\nMy latest battle with how vr.enable puts the camera at 0,0,0 but VR renders black otherwise is also suggesting no one is making the desktop and WebVR actually look and work consistently together. \r\nI've noted something about attaching a camera to the train in rollercoaster so maybe it should be that it takes the current camera like vr.setCamera or something. Alas that will be another post. Still have the camera stomped on my target object for desktop orbit controls. As soon as you set vr.ennbled = true (I tried putting it the WebGLRenderer object args which is how I think all geo should be made too if you recall that idea which I'll do something with and post eventually.)\r\nI've also hack the daylights out of WebVR.js which is now 88 from 152 lines for me. Partly because adding the Enter VR button with 'let's would not appear on screen but it still needs some work it's partly able to take any button or find one with an Id in the dom already etc. So more versatile. Again maybe I'll post it but I don't think it's in tune with my adoption of the newer superior 'let' declarator vs the traditional vars here.\r\nThe closure in WebVR is nice but I try to keep an open API for flexibility. I also added it to THREE.WebVR so one less var there and it puts it in the right place structurally.\r\n\r\nAnyway if you want me to post the 3 lines that correct orientation in an easy to merge version I will (with appreciation and thanks) but it looks like I've got to resolve the damage vr.enable does to the scenes current camera position before this makes sense because I'm unsure how it's all working together smoothly or not yet.
