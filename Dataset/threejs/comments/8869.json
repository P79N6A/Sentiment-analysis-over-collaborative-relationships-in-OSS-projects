I would have expected that copy&clone on the root object3d loaded from a glTF would have given me an object that renders correctly :)\n\nTo refactor this, either the shader\/animation(s) would need to be contained within the loaded hierarchy  OR if it is more desirable that they are owned by an external container (glTFShaders\/glTFAnimator), the direction of referencing would need to be reversed: instead of the shader\/animation pointing to a mesh, the mesh would have a reference to the shader\/animation. The latter approach might not work for animations - all copies would share the same animation pace & timing, which might need further refactoring.\n","created_at":"2016-05-12T18:23:29.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8869#issuecomment-218843234","id":218843234,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8869","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxODg0MzIzNA==","updated_at":"2016-05-12T18:25:49.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/218843234","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kkananen\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kkananen\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1742765?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kkananen","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kkananen\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/kkananen","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kkananen\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDI3NjU=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kkananen\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kkananen\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kkananen\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"kkananen","type":"User","id":1742765,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kkananen\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/kkananen\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"NONE","body":"so.
