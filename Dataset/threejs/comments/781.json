The latest version is available here: http:\/\/www.toasterltd.com\/2011\/11\/duck-shoot\/\n\nOn the phone side, my objective is now to rotate the ball using fingers and then throw it with a swipe gesture (I\u2019m using CanvasRenderer which is performing extremely well on Android ICS \/ iPhone), but this does not seem to be possible with trackball controls, where what you are really rotating is the camera and not the ball itself. Moving the ball out from the origin makes it orbit around the screen rather than leaving it in one direction.\n\nWhat's the best way to go in this scenario? This would be a really lovely addition to the game.
