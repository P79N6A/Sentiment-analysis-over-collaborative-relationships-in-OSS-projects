Though using a stencil buffer would incur less of a memory footprint and possibly less per-pixel cost than a render target reflection would (assuming that the main scene and mirror have equivalent resolution), I think a render target offers more flexibility. For example, I can render the reflection at a significantly lower resolution for a cheap, non-glossy, reflection or I can update the reflection less frequently (say, every other frame) to save some rendering cost (if my perspective is changing slowly enough). And, as mentioned, having the reflection as a texture that we can pipe into any shader would also be very, very useful.\n\nI used to work in UE3 a few years ago and we made heavy use of their SceneCaptureReflectActor which was essentially what Slayvin built. You could change settings on it to control how often it was updated as well as whether fog, post-process, or lighting was done in the render. You can build a lot of functionality on something as generic as this.\n","created_at":"2013-09-11T03:19:31.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/3856#issuecomment-24210736","id":24210736,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/3856","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjEwNzM2","updated_at":"2013-09-11T03:19:31.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/24210736","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MiiBond\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MiiBond\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1069125?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MiiBond","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MiiBond\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/MiiBond","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MiiBond\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjkxMjU=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MiiBond\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MiiBond\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MiiBond\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"MiiBond","type":"User","id":1069125,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MiiBond\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MiiBond\/orgs"}},{"index":7,"author_association":"NONE","body":"@Slayvin with a few additions, your FlatMirror shader can be adapted into an animated water-surface-effect shader.

I've used this mirror effect yesterday to create a working water example, here: http:\/\/www.prismshards.com\/testing\/3DgsProject\/project\/project.htm , gotta give it a minute to load the ground\/caustic texture.  Also, this is my first attempt at a shader and I just finished, so now I need to go back and make the code a lot more efficient and more object oriented, which I will do.  Shrinking your browser window will make it run faster, since the water quad size is based on the window width\/height.  It also has an ocean shader that works and is based off of OutsideOfSociety's ocean example using the normal shader and color\/specular ramping with simplex noise which I adapted for the newest version of three.js ( http:\/\/www.webgl.com\/2012\/03\/webgl-demo-water-ocean\/ ), and also it has a colliding sine wave generator that can be toggled based on ( http:\/\/www.jayconrod.com\/posts\/50\/water-simulation-demo-in-webgl ), both of which work fine (though I haven't tested them since I changed the code a bit so they might need small tweaking).  I haven't added a way to toggle them outside of the code yet, but I would be willing to do that if you guys thought this would be a good water solution (but obviously I need to change the code a bunch, needs less render targets, more object oriented, less operations in shaders, etc. etc.).  Alternatively, it would also be very easy to just load an animated texture into the height map and have that alter the whole pipeline of the water surface now (for quaking water).  The caustics are based on Evan Wallace's WebGL water.  I would be willing to make like a beach scene and add a gui for changing all the settings if anyone thinks it's worth it.\n\nBasically I had a question for Slayvin.  I started to implement Oblique Frustum Culling in this water, but then right after I started, I found this thread.  The issue is that, when you set the mirror's material to THREE.DoubleSide you get a strange result (visually, not mathematically).  It appears to me like the texture matrix then goes to double or halve itself so that you get a rotating radial view of the reflection.  Or maybe it has something to do with the Texture2DProj() function in the shader which I haven't had time to look up yet.  My question was though, is there a way to change the original textureMatrix so that it will handle double-sided mirrors?  Right now I am using a trick so that I am flipping the mirror's normal if the camera is below the water surface and also flipping the material from THREE.FrontSide to THREE.Backside.  This is easy if you know which side of the surface the camera is on, but will probably get more tricky if the water surface is rotated at angles, and it also requires that you set those things in your update loop, which adds complexity if you want more than one water surface.  Anyways, thanks for reading, and great work on the mirror!\n","created_at":"2013-09-22T18:58:13.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/3856#issuecomment-24888036","id":24888036,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/3856","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0ODg4MDM2","updated_at":"2013-09-22T18:58:13.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/24888036","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brokedRobot\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brokedRobot\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/4894314?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brokedRobot","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brokedRobot\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/brokedRobot","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brokedRobot\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4OTQzMTQ=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brokedRobot\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brokedRobot\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brokedRobot\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"brokedRobot","type":"User","id":4894314,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brokedRobot\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/brokedRobot\/orgs"}},{"index":15,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"> I would be willing to make like a beach scene and add a gui for changing all the settings if anyone thinks it's worth it.\n\nDefinitely worth it! :D\n","created_at":"2013-09-23T23:05:44.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/3856#issuecomment-24962764","id":24962764,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/3856","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTYyNzY0","updated_at":"2013-09-23T23:05:44.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/24962764","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/97088?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDg4","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"mrdoob","type":"User","id":97088,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/orgs"}},{"index":16,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@brokedRobot , I guess it would be possible to handle double-sided mirrors by modifying the textureMatrix, in theory.

I'm still hoping to have time to make a revised example, but I've had less free time since I've been doing some extra stuff for work.  There's actually a sine wave vertex shader in the example I posted that might work for what you're talking about?  It's not enabled in the example but I'll try to fix it up a little this weekend and post it.  The main issue with the example I made is that I used a bunch of render targets because I kept overwriting accidentally at one point, but I think theoretically I should be able to use just one effects composer and set swap buffers.  Or you could use one of the height maps for displacement.  Vertex shaders get pretty costly though when you introduce all the new triangles along with the complicated fragment shader.  So a giant body of water could be really slow.
