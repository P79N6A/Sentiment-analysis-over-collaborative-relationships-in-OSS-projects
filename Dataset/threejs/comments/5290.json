The normal is just used to calculate the projected point on the plane that defined by the triangle.

If you want to calculate the distance between a point to a mesh, you basically need to find the closest point on the mesh to a given point. This can be done by iterating through all triangles, calculate the distance between the point and every triangle. Notice that this is not necessary a distance to the plane defined by the triangle, so you need this function to calculate the distance between a point and triangle.\n2. Finding the projected point to the triangle is a given in this function, you can use this projected point to snap the point to the mesh. Let's say there is a point moving towards a mesh (not necessary along a straight line, because then you can use ray casting), if you want to snap the point to the mesh when they are close enough within a threshold, you need this function to calculate the distance and the projected point. \nHope it's clear
