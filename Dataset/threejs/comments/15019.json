If the geometry is not closed, the last row of vertices is generated at its actual position. But when the geometry is closed, the first row of vertices is duplicated in order to connect the geometry so it is actually closed\/continuous (the duplication is necessary since the first and last row of vertices have different uvs). \r\n\r\nThe current implementation ensures that the amount of vertices is equal for both types of geometries (closed vs. not closed). This makes it easier to generate indices and uvs later in the generator.\r\n\r\nBTW: Using  `TubeGeometry` with a line and set close to `true` does actually not make sense. The implementation does not generate caps (like `CylinderGeometry` does). It connects both ends of the tube which has no real benefit for a straight line.","created_at":"2018-10-08T14:03:32.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/15019#issuecomment-427846625","id":427846625,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/15019","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzg0NjYyNQ==","updated_at":"2018-10-08T17:28:54.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/427846625","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/12612165?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mugen87","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Mugen87","type":"User","id":12612165,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/orgs"}},{"index":1,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Fiddle for reproduction: https:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/f2Lommf5\/15141\/","created_at":"2018-10-08T14:04:03.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/15019#issuecomment-427846809","id":427846809,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/15019","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzg0NjgwOQ==","updated_at":"2018-10-08T14:04:03.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/427846809","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/12612165?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/Mugen87","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjEyMTY1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"Mugen87","type":"User","id":12612165,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/Mugen87\/orgs"}}]}
