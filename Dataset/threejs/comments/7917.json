I'm having a tough time understanding why this should be the case (though I'm definitely fairly new to three.js).\n\nFrom reading posts (including this one), it seems like `fromBufferGeometry` is not expected to get much use, which is surprising to me, perhaps I'm doing something weird.  My use case is loading a model (via `OBJLoader`), which returns a `BufferGeometry`.  Then I wish to make it deformable for cloth simulation and `Geometry` seems like the right object to use.\n\nFor now, I have this following workaround, though it feels like this should not be necessary:\n\n```\nextractGeometryFromBuffer = function(bufferGeo) {\n  var geometry = new THREE.Geometry().fromBufferGeometry(bufferGeo);\n\n  \/\/ This appears to not get copied over properly, not clear why\n  for (let group of bufferGeo.groups) {\n    let start = group.start \/ 3;\n    let end = start + group.count \/ 3;\n    for (let f = start; f < end; ++f) {\n      geometry.faces[f].materialIndex = group.materialIndex;\n    }\n  }\n\n  geometry.computeFaceNormals();\n  geometry.mergeVertices();\n  geometry.computeVertexNormals();\n\n  return geometry;\n};\n```\n\nAlso, thanks WestLangley for your responses to the issues here and on SO, they've been really helpful a number of times!\n","created_at":"2016-09-29T19:43:09.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7917#issuecomment-250570378","id":250570378,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7917","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MDU3MDM3OA==","updated_at":"2016-09-29T19:43:54.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/250570378","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jmstein\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jmstein\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/544544?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jmstein","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jmstein\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/jmstein","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jmstein\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU0NA==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jmstein\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jmstein\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jmstein\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"jmstein","type":"User","id":544544,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jmstein\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/jmstein\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"> My use case is loading a model (via `OBJLoader`), which returns a `BufferGeometry`.
