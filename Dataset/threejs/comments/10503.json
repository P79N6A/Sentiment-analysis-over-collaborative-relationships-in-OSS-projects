But ...\r\n\r\nAfter I saw 'BevelModifier', my first reaction was a 'how ambitious' since generalizing might mean covering lots of corner cases and such. Though sometimes it just means coming up with a smarter solution. It certainly is another category of effort than trying to improve the existing logic.\r\n\r\nIf Blender has a BevelModifier, I would probably go and try to find out how it works first.\r\n\r\nThen, another viable solution would be to try to adapt the ExtrudeGeometry bevel approach to other geometries. \r\n\r\nThere the first question is how to identify which edges to bevel: all which are more acute than a threshold ? (This would allow surfaces composed of triangulated, flat polygons).\r\n\r\nThen, the bevel behaviour probably needs to be to cut into a body rather than expand out. So, I would first try to modify the current extrudeGeometry bevel to that effect, see above.\r\n\r\nThinking about that and concretely which direction at the beveled edge between two neighbouring polygons of a general geometry would correspond to what is currently the z direction (extrusion direction), it seems unlikely that a lot of the current implementation could be reused. Back to blender or research.\r\n\r\nFor that it is useful to have thought about the problem in advance.\r\n\r\n``` \r\n--------+-------\r\n     A  |  B\r\n```\r\nA|B is an edge which needs to beveled.\r\nLet's say we an find out which direction is 'to inside' from the winding orders (normals).\r\n``` \r\n--------+-------\r\n    A| s|s |B\r\n```\r\ns is the size of the bevel: how to measure ? Probably better to define a bevel depth d, eg. how deep the bevel would cut into the edge. d would be measure along the bisector of the two polygons (triangles).\r\n\r\nLets just consider a straight bevel first.\r\n\r\nThe complication is where multiple edges meet\r\n\r\n``` \r\n--------+-------\r\n    A| s|s |B\r\n     |  |  | \r\n______  |  ______\r\n   s    |   s   \r\n--------+-------\r\n    C| s|s |D\r\n```\r\nSo, similar to the current getBevVec one can find the point where two retracted edges meet.\r\n\r\nWhat if the A|C should not be beveled (but A|B should) ? Getting complicated but at least I have an appreciation of the problems. It looks like all edges need to be beveled once you start with one.\r\n\r\nIs that what you in had in mind when suggestion bevel for general geometries ?\r\n\r\nIt looks like I will for now continue to look for (much) lower hanging fruits.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-06T20:03:08.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10503#issuecomment-270992505","id":270992505,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10503","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MDk5MjUwNQ==","updated_at":"2017-01-06T20:03:08.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/270992505","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/andreasplesch\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/andreasplesch\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/6171115?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/andreasplesch","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/andreasplesch\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/andreasplesch","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/andreasplesch\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNzExMTU=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/andreasplesch\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/andreasplesch\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/andreasplesch\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"andreasplesch","type":"User","id":6171115,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/andreasplesch\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/andreasplesch\/orgs"}},{"index":8,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"https:\/\/github.com\/BlenderVR\/blender\/blob\/master\/source\/blender\/bmesh\/tools\/bmesh_bevel.c\r\n\r\nis the main code responsible for bevels in blender.
