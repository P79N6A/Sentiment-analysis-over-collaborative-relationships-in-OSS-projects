for sharing the files!\r\n\r\nUm, the problem is that your `DAE` file does something which is not supported by `three.js`. Your model expects that `three.js` should sample the alpha value of a `PNG` texture and use it as the opacity value for the model. The problem is that these textures are interpreted as alpha maps. But alpha maps are grayscale textures in `three.js` (see [docs](https:\/\/threejs.org\/docs\/index.html#api\/materials\/MeshBasicMaterial.alphaMap)). \r\n\r\nYour PR does not actually solve the problem since the loader still applies invalid textures to `material.alphaMap`. I don't fully understand why your model sets the same textures twice as diffuse and alpha maps. But I assume this is a valid approach of the Collada spec.

It makes the transparent = true model to seems non-transparent only If I change the opacity over 1, about 1.5 or 2-ish.

But I assume this is a valid approach of the Collada spec\r\n\r\nI think it's valid because in Collada spec:\r\n> Determining Transparency (Opacity)\r\n> If either < transparent > or < transparency > exists then transparency rendering is activated, the\r\n> renderer needs to turn on alpha blending mode, and the following equations define how to combine the\r\n> two values.

This is equivalent to:\r\n>  transparent = < color > 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 < \/color >\r\n> \u2022 If < transparency > does not exist then it has no effect on the equation\u2019s result.
