When an attribute is misaligned, iOS must perform additional processing before passing the data to the graphics hardware.\r\n>\r\n> In Figure 8-4, the position and normal data are each defined as three short integers, for a total of six bytes. The normal data begins at offset 6, which is a multiple of the native size (2 bytes), but is not a multiple of 4 bytes. If this vertex data were submitted to iOS, iOS would have to take additional time to copy and align the data before passing it to the hardware. To fix this, explicitly add two bytes of padding after each attribute.\r\n\r\n![image](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/1142958\/43858232-6d41ef64-9b45-11e8-9c59-fbea5deb490d.png)","created_at":"2018-08-09T00:00:38.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14178#issuecomment-411592506","id":411592506,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14178","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMTU5MjUwNg==","updated_at":"2018-08-09T00:00:38.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/411592506","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1142958?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/benaadams","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDI5NTg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"benaadams","type":"User","id":1142958,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/benaadams\/orgs"}}]}
