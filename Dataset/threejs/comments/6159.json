The original geometry and its relation to the armature appears to be preserved. The export geometry is replaced with the original. Same logic that has always been in place. This does lead me to consider something that is common in CG pipelines when performing conversions, exports, or publishes which is save the current scene to a working file (commonly $TMPDIR) and upon completion (success or failure) re-open the original scene.\n\nNormally export artifacts in a scene aren't an issue with my work flow because I run lots of my exports in a batch mode that opens the scenes, runs the export, and closes without saving. Animation exports are a unique pain because the context changes that have to occur don't work in batch mode (at least I haven't figured out an alternate way to do this without tripping over the UI contextual awareness), which isn't pipeline friendly if you want to dispatch your exports to the farm\/cloud.\n\nGoing to now seriously considering implementing this as a feature (boolean parameter a user could disable). This will mean users should be proactively saving their scenes (which they should be while working in production!) before running the export because an edit would get lost when the scene re-opens.\n","created_at":"2015-03-02T20:22:12.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6159#issuecomment-76808404","id":76808404,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6159","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2ODA4NDA0","updated_at":"2015-03-02T20:22:12.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/76808404","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1109289?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/repsac","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDkyODk=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"repsac","type":"User","id":1109289,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/repsac\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"NONE","body":"OK, thanks for looking into this - I just stumbled upon the issue when experimenting with animation exports.
