However, although the current version provides several scheduling features, `AnimationMixer` does not implement a full sequencer, as I guess might be needed for handling the general case (see https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/7312#issuecomment-209473262).\n","created_at":"2016-04-16T23:07:42.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7913#issuecomment-210921367","id":210921367,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7913","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDkyMTM2Nw==","updated_at":"2016-04-16T23:07:42.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/210921367","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/3916357?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/tschw","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTYzNTc=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"tschw","type":"User","id":3916357,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/orgs"}},{"index":1,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for these good news.
