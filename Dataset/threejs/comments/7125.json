STEP is 3d for its advanced_face's that make up a part's surface. Either have to use heuristics to get back to 2d or develop vertice\/face operations in 3d.  In STEP also holes drilled are in 3d.

is complex, and in most cases will need to be processed by a CAD kernel to get to a format that three.js can currently load.   The reason is that STEP contains several representations for geometric shapes, the most common being Advanced BREP (often with NURBS and trimming).   There is an open source project that generates a low-level API for STEP data (www.stepcode.org) that is used by BRL-CAD and OpenVSP.   OpenCasCade has its own STEP translation capability, which is used by FreeCAD (and others) for STEP and IfcOpenShell for IFC.  Clara.io can import both STEP and IFC, but like many other free tools (including open source such as FreeCAD and OpenCasCADE) lacks modern STEP capabilities like associative 3D text, supplemental geometry, model styling and organization, tessellation, user defined attributes, PMI, etc. (www.cax-if.org).    The NIST STEP File Analyzer can convert most modern STEP capabilities to VRML\/X3D, and is free but not open source.   So unless three.js develops capabilities to cover more of the STEP geometric representations, STEP and IFC data will need to be processed by something into a form that three.js can load (like three.js json, STL, VRML\/X3D, COLLADA, etc.)\n","created_at":"2015-12-19T23:37:16.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7125#issuecomment-166033971","id":166033971,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7125","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjAzMzk3MQ==","updated_at":"2015-12-19T23:37:16.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/166033971","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1005180?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/charliestirk","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDUxODA=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"charliestirk","type":"User","id":1005180,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/orgs"}},{"index":9,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@charliestirk Clara.io uses the OpenCascade kernel to import STEP.  :)  We recently added support for instancing, LOD generation in tesselation, and hierarchy extraction (this last one goes live next week) when importing STEP files.\n","created_at":"2015-12-20T03:55:16.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7125#issuecomment-166060623","id":166060623,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7125","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjA2MDYyMw==","updated_at":"2015-12-20T03:55:16.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/166060623","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/588541?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/bhouston","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODU0MQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"bhouston","type":"User","id":588541,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/orgs"}},{"index":10,"author_association":"NONE","body":"At the start I mentioned an antl4 v4 grammar and a layer that I have putting the STEP 'description' in memory.

Do you also use IfcOpenShell for IFC? Your contributions to three.js are well known, and I agree that the Clara.io API is a good path from STEP to three.js.   For STEP hierarchy extraction, I assume you mean what STEP calls assembly structure?   It would be useful if Clara.io could handle some of the modern CAX-IF Recommended Practices.   Regarding the OpenCasCade STEP translator, there has been discussion in the OCE, OCCT, IfcOpenShell and STEPcode communities about upgrading it to handle recent STEP capabilities, but a switchover to STEPcode would be a huge task.  Besides new capabilities, if there were memory or speed improvements, then it might be worth it.   In the meantime, the OCCT developers have been good about fixing bugs in the current translator.   \n","created_at":"2015-12-23T21:05:58.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7125#issuecomment-166989833","id":166989833,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7125","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2Njk4OTgzMw==","updated_at":"2015-12-23T21:05:58.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/166989833","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1005180?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/charliestirk","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDUxODA=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"charliestirk","type":"User","id":1005180,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/charliestirk\/orgs"}},{"index":13,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@charliestirk I do not believe we import IFC well at this point, but it is on our list of things to do.\n\nWe do handle the assemblies from STEP.
