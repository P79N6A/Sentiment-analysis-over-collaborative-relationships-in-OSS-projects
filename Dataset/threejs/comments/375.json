What would be needed are then texture atlases with some indexing for sprite evolution \/ varied per-particle look and some management of behaviors \/ life-cycle either in JavaScript or in shaders. Probably easier to start in JS, just treat WebGL as dumb renderer and then when seeing more of what's going on trying to move common patterns into shaders.\n\nAnyways, particles are very rich topic, another rabbit hole ;) This is something I planned to look into more properly already since quite some

set `geometry.__dirtyXXX` flags to ask for buffer update. \n\nSo for vertices, it's `geometry.__dirtyVertices = true;` and for colors it's `geometry.__dirtyColors = true;` after you change something. \n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/blob\/dev\/examples\/webgl_particles_dynamic.html#L589\n\nCustom attributes have `needsUpdate` flags:\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/blob\/dev\/examples\/webgl_custom_attributes_particles.html#L213\n\n(meshes additionally also need to have set `mesh.dynamic = true` to preserve their internal typed array buffers)\n\nNow with sorting, particles get buffer updates by default, because sorting have to update buffers in any case. \n\nBut if you don't need sorting, it's better not to have it enabled, it's a major performance drain.\n\n> Also, is there a way to load an texture from a generated canvas rather than from a server?\n\nYes, you can pass in 2d canvas element as parameter
