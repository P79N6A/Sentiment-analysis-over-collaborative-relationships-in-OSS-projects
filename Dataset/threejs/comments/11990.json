Without that, the default is OPAQUE, and so the three.js loader is doing the \"correct\" thing by not showing transparency. Support for standard Blender materials (as opposed to glTF PBR) was [only recently added](https:\/\/github.com\/KhronosGroup\/glTF-Blender-Exporter\/pull\/53) to the Blender exporter \u2014 you may want to either file a bug on the exporter to support opacity on these materials, or use the glTF PBR nodes provided with the exporter, which are fully supported.\r\n* **smoothing** \u2014 This is a setting in Blender. Select *Tools \u2192 Edit \u2192 Shading \u2192 Smooth*, and on export you should see smooth normals again.\r\n* **file size** \u2014 There are a lot of things in this example file that could technically be exported more efficiently... The geometry for each wheel is duplicated, some materials are duplicated, etc. I wouldn't expect the Blender exporter to handle those automatically, so just an FYI really. If you're going to use smooth shading everywhere, you could skip exporting normals. This brings the size down to 426kb, and then you can set smooth shading in three.js:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodel.traverse((node) => {\r\n  if (node.isMesh) {\r\n    node.material.shading = THREE.SmoothShading; \/\/ <=r86\r\n    node.material.flatShading = false; \/\/ r87+\r\n    node.material.needsUpdate = true;\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's another project, [gltf-pipeline](https:\/\/github.com\/AnalyticalGraphicsInc\/gltf-pipeline), that is intended to help with optimizing assets for you. But unfortunately that's not quite ready to go yet, for glTF2.0 files.","created_at":"2017-08-20T21:53:33.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11990#issuecomment-323614432","id":323614432,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11990","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzYxNDQzMg==","updated_at":"2017-08-20T21:53:33.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/323614432","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}},{"index":1,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"I went ahead and opened an issue about the missing opacity data: https:\/\/github.com\/KhronosGroup\/glTF-Blender-Exporter\/issues\/72","created_at":"2017-08-20T22:05:18.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11990#issuecomment-323615062","id":323615062,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11990","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzYxNTA2Mg==","updated_at":"2017-08-20T22:05:18.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/323615062","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the help!","created_at":"2017-08-21T05:11:11.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11990#issuecomment-323647762","id":323647762,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11990","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMzY0Nzc2Mg==","updated_at":"2017-08-21T05:11:11.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/323647762","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ghost\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ghost\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/10137?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ghost","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ghost\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/ghost","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ghost\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ghost\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ghost\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ghost\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"ghost","type":"User","id":10137,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ghost\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/ghost\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Sorry to reopen this one, but I feel like my question fits here :)\r\nI have a model that I exported with your exporter from blender to gltf 2.0.\r\nIt looks nice in [your viewer, donmccurdy](https:\/\/gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com\/).
