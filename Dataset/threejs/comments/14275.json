Whenever you want to check for a float, it's good to make it fuzzy. In this last example that middle segment is guaranteed to have the what's supposed to be `0.5` value, but it still didn't work. \r\n\r\nCheck out this mindblowing thing:\r\n\r\nWill not cause artifacts, even though `_EPSILON` is just 0\r\n\r\n```glsl\r\nconst float _EPSILON = 0.000000;\r\nconst float SEG_START = 0.5 - EPSILON;\r\nconst float SEG_END = 0.5 + EPSILON;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill cause artifacts. \r\n```glsl\r\nconst float SEG_START = 0.5;\r\nconst float SEG_END = 0.5;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'd need to check out https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/14275\/commits\/30bbf6076e914cd97f397ffb920f27fc4b41ed9c","created_at":"2018-06-12T17:39:04.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/14275#issuecomment-396673559","id":396673559,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14275","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NjY3MzU1OQ==","updated_at":"2018-06-12T18:33:08.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/396673559","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/4681282?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/pailhead","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODEyODI=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"pailhead","type":"User","id":4681282,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/orgs"}},{"index":12,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Slightly different results, from #14279, maybe we could look into not clipping all the caps for dashed.
