The then-current API has had an impact on how the examples were written and they have often just been ported over to the newer API. So there may not so much to understand, except that there are historical reasons.\nAlso, some examples in r73 still contain optimizations that are not advisable in general. If you see something that looks strange, see whether it's still present in the `dev` branch - if not, you're looking at a no longer needed optimization.\n\nThe `dev` \/ r74 version of the animation system has undergone a thorough overhaul, is several times faster and has a new (not yet frozen) API.\n\n> first equalizer, lots of button that I don't know what they do and why you would use them\n\nWhile the examples are nice to quickly get some code to play with, it's always best to look at the library classes to understand the design of the system. There is also quite a bit of documentation in the sources.\n","created_at":"2015-10-28T05:53:54.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7474#issuecomment-151733510","id":151733510,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7474","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MTczMzUxMA==","updated_at":"2015-10-28T05:53:54.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/151733510","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/3916357?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/tschw","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTYzNTc=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"tschw","type":"User","id":3916357,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/tschw\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Appreciate the responses :)  I will pull dev and play with that.
