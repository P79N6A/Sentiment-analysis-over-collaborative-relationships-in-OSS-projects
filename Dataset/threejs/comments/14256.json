Other assumptions could be:\r\n\r\n- re: forum issue - `LoadingManager doesn't work with GLTFLoader`\r\n- gltf format is not best suited for three.js (or vice-versa)\r\n- `GLTFLoader` could be refactored\r\n\r\nFor example, either `GLTFLoader` could be made to work with `GLTFLoadingManager` or refactored if possible. Otherwise, it would be fair to explain why 2% of the loading examples should get preferential treatment, possibly outlining the scope of this influence (should GLTFLoader own the entire library, or just parts of it). I've seen it push for a complete `Material` systems overhaul of three.js, here it's the loading managers, it would be useful to define these extents. Then, should this be expanded to other loaders etc. \r\n\r\nBy no means am I suggesting that a loader should not warrant such a refactor, but I believe that this should be the last resort, after all the other reasonable avenues are explored.

I am pretty new to JavaScript and appreciate I don't understand then nuances properly but it seems like there is no clean way that I can find to know when I can start working with the models, other than checking in the update loop every time if the data is available which feels really dirty.\r\n\r\nThis is the console output I am seeing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmain.js:Main():model load begin\r\nboxManager.js:62 boxManager.js:setupBoxes():about to Model.load() box asset\r\nboxManager.js:64 boxManager.js:setupBoxes():about to push box\r\nboxManager.js:62 boxManager.js:setupBoxes():about to Model.load() box asset\r\nboxManager.js:64 boxManager.js:setupBoxes():about to push box\r\nboxManager.js:62 boxManager.js:setupBoxes():about to Model.load() box asset\r\nboxManager.js:64 boxManager.js:setupBoxes():about to push box\r\nboxManager.js:62 boxManager.js:setupBoxes():about to Model.load() box asset\r\nboxManager.js:64 boxManager.js:setupBoxes():about to push box\r\nboxManager.js:62 boxManager.js:setupBoxes():about to Model.load() box asset\r\nboxManager.js:64 boxManager.js:setupBoxes():about to push box\r\nboxManager.js:62 boxManager.js:setupBoxes():about to Model.load() box asset\r\nboxManager.js:64 boxManager.js:setupBoxes():about to push box\r\nmain.js:148 main.js:Main():model load completed\r\n6 helpers.js:49 100% downloaded\r\nmain.js:152 .\/assets\/models\/second-cardboard-box.gltf: 1 2\r\nmain.js:152 .\/assets\/models\/second-cardboard-box.bin: 2 2\r\nmain.js:168 Everything is now fully loaded\r\n6 boxManager.js:73 boxManager.js:test_obj_available():why is item.obj null?\r\n6 model.js:91 Model.js:load():about to add group\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"Everything is now fully loaded\" should be the last part of the LoadingManager finishing, but its not finished and I cannot find another clean way to confirm that all models have finished loading.\r\n\r\nSo, I am really sorry to have dropped into this conversation but it seems closest to what I'm experiencing and if the answer is that it's a known bug then maybe I can finally get some sleep tonight.\r\n\r\nUpdate: further research [has lead me to the thread](https:\/\/discourse.threejs.org\/t\/gltfloader-defaultloadingmanager\/3062\/3) that started this issue off (always the same when I have stepped up to publically embarrass myself with a silly question) so it seems like I am experiencing the same thing. Would appreciate if anyone else can confirm from what I have described.\r\n\r\nSeems the solution could be to use ","created_at":"2018-06-28T16:21:16.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14256#issuecomment-401092118","id":401092118,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14256","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTA5MjExOA==","updated_at":"2018-06-28T16:32:34.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/401092118","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rtpHarry\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rtpHarry\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1038062?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rtpHarry","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rtpHarry\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/rtpHarry","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rtpHarry\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzgwNjI=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rtpHarry\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rtpHarry\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rtpHarry\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"rtpHarry","type":"User","id":1038062,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rtpHarry\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/rtpHarry\/orgs"}},{"index":11,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Hi @rtpHarry \u2014 that is the issue described here, yes.
