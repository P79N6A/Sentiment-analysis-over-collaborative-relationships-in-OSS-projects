I was going for that solution as well. I wasn't aware that this would turn out difficult. \r\n\r\n@takahirox  i see you your point there.\r\n\r\nThe problem with GL_LINES\/GL_LINE_STRIP (THREE.LineSegments\/THREE.LIne) is that there is no guarantee any browser will display any other width than 1, so you should stay with 1. But this is quite an issue for higher resolution monitors (e.g. 4K or even 8K) because the lines are getting really thin there (glLineWidth = 1 meaning 1 pixel width). \r\n\r\nSo i think triangle based lines like Line2\/LineSegments2 would be the way go and should be considered to be added to the core library.
