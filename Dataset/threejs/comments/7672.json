What would the light size be in that case? Maybe the paper is more about area lights?\n\nI may be incorrect about the equation for directional lights, but the sun does have a size, it is just huge but very far away.  I know that the shadow from a sun\/directional light should be crisp at the point of contact between the object and the surface on which it is casting a shadow but it should then increase in width (image from V-Ray):\n\n![sunandsky_24](https:\/\/cloud.githubusercontent.com\/assets\/588541\/11373398\/24024c96-92a0-11e5-9d4e-5c32ef72cae1.png)\n\nIn this equation:\n\n```\nwidthPenumbra = ( distanceToReceiver \u2013 distanceToBlocker) * radiusLight \/ distanceToBlocker;\n```\n\nI think we can estimate the radiusLight \/ distanceToBlock for a sun with 1\/215, which is the ratio of the sun's radius over the distance from the sun to the earth [(source)](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Solar_radius).  Thus for the directional light one could then use radiusLight as a multiplier on the sun's radius.  Thus it would become:\n\n```\nconst float cSunRadiusDividedByDistanceFromEarth = 1.0 \/ 215.0;\nwidthPenumbra = ( distanceToReceiver \u2013 distanceToBlocker) * radiusLight * cSunRadiusDividedByDistanceFromEarth;\n```\n\nV-Ray uses a sun radius multiplier for its sun lights.  Although it also offers on its directional lights a light radius, which may be something like this in order to get the crisp shadows at the contact point:\n\n```\nwidthPenumbra = ( distanceToReceiver \u2013 distanceToBlocker) * radiusLight;\n```\n\nI can leave out a penumbra calculation for the directional lights though because it isn't clear what to use.\n\nBTW area lights do not need a light radius because they have width\/height that define their emission area.\n","created_at":"2015-11-24T16:50:16.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7672#issuecomment-159334553","id":159334553,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7672","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTMzNDU1Mw==","updated_at":"2015-11-24T17:10:13.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/159334553","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/588541?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/bhouston","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODU0MQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"bhouston","type":"User","id":588541,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/orgs"}},{"index":3,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> BTW area lights do not need a light radius\n\nArea lights can be circular.\n\nI prefer \"diameter\" in that case, as it is akin to \"width\".

Is about some kind of light helper that gets the total scene size as a light power multiplier. I imagine you'd have to turn it on (not a default) but it would solve the problem when you scale a scene and the lack of distance vs lumes falloff. Lights could have illumination intensity in percentage of 10 meters say.\nThen the light intensity would increase for larger scenes or possibly effect the lights' sourceSize which could also use a similar dimensions helper to adjust the shadow softness. \nIdeally it would also adjust based on frame rates achieved and a valued priority for effects the user could change but the default would be robust. So first reflection maps or thier resolutions are sacrificed then shadow map size or maybe texture size etc. \nAnyway just some more crazy ideas maybe the discussion will trigger a more attainable idea or direction in the future. And yes it seems relevent that a closeup of a shadow would jack up the resolution dynamically as you get closer for a smoother edge, or yes the softness of that calculation.\nBasically in interactive graphics it is a procedural problem, and should be handled in the renderer when possible that dynamic way too. Similar to having higher geo detail for a window (amongst many) on a skyscraper as you get closer. Ultimately with point clouds you get intelligent sampling through lookup optimization or something like that (as I am understanding those ideas only in general thus far.) It's related and important for map lookups unless GPU performance on mobile gets game station performance\/ram or some remote 'shield' like RAAS  rendering as a service. Maybe that could also involve a different idea of extending distribution of the lookup of larger maps etc. Again just thinking aloud thanks for listening. I believe THREE.js will replace the DOM in my world.\nSigned MJ aka Night Dreamer \n","created_at":"2015-11-25T00:37:50.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7672#issuecomment-159448622","id":159448622,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7672","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1OTQ0ODYyMg==","updated_at":"2015-11-25T00:37:50.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/159448622","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MasterJames\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MasterJames\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1840183?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MasterJames","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MasterJames\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/MasterJames","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MasterJames\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDAxODM=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MasterJames\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MasterJames\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MasterJames\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"MasterJames","type":"User","id":1840183,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MasterJames\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/MasterJames\/orgs"}},{"index":17,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Implemented as radius on light.shadow.","created_at":"2018-05-28T13:37:33.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7672#issuecomment-392529155","id":392529155,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7672","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MjUyOTE1NQ==","updated_at":"2018-05-28T13:37:33.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/392529155","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/588541?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/bhouston","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODU0MQ==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"bhouston","type":"User","id":588541,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/bhouston\/orgs"}}]}
