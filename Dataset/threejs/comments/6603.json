Here's what I found: When I upgraded an application from revision ~59 to 71 I got what I think is the same error. I discovered that the application was using THREE.Line and found that setLineBuffers() was being called. Consequently, __webglUVBuffers is undefined and WebGL complains when trying to bindBuffer. The 'fix' for me was simple, test for both geometryGroup.__webglUVBuffer && object.geometry.faceVertexUvs[ 0 ] in the renderBuffer method. I'm not experienced enough with three.js to know why the faceVertexUVs[ 0 ] test is insufficient. I also apologize for not being able to provide a test case; I don't understand the root cause well enough to distill my complex app down. I can add that I am using ShaderMaterial which may be important. I hope this means something to those \"In the know\".

But my Project is huge and so i couldn't easily reduce it, not knowing where to look. I then tried to debug it myself but it goes too deeply into THREE and webgl internals that i would have to understand first. All i did to cause it was update to r71 and set renderOrder=2 on a BufferGeom mesh (and 1 on a BufferGeom line), these two things were enough. And so i hoped anyone here would perhaps already know the issue.\n\nI have since reworked my Shaders to adapt them to r71 entirely (fog implementation changed among some other things) and the error is gone. I also had some custom material cloning that i adapted.

The fact that you modified your shaders and caused it to go away is significant to me. Three.js decides what buffers to to use during rendering based upon the 'standard' shader attributes that it successfully manages to cache. But some of these attributes may be unused by the shader program and the ShaderMaterial class prepends a bunch of attributes to your shader code which may not all be used. The trouble then happens when such attributes exist but corresponding buffers are not created and bound. The difference between what buffers are prepared by setLineBuffers() and setMeshBuffers() gets towards the root cause. The problem is that ShaderMaterial is not configured according to whether it is being consumed by a Mesh or a Line. One work-around might be to take control by using RawShaderMaterial, but you still have to conform to Three.js protocols if you are using the Mesh and Line objects.\n\nI'm glad that the issue no longer affects you, but I believe the library still has a problem.\n","created_at":"2015-06-12T16:24:23.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6603#issuecomment-111544011","id":111544011,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/6603","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMTU0NDAxMQ==","updated_at":"2015-06-12T16:24:23.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/111544011","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mathdoodle\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mathdoodle\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/12652394?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mathdoodle","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mathdoodle\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mathdoodle","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mathdoodle\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjUyMzk0","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mathdoodle\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mathdoodle\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mathdoodle\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"mathdoodle","type":"User","id":12652394,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mathdoodle\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mathdoodle\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@mrdoob It seems `Object3D.renderDepth` was renamed to `Object3D.renderOrder` at some version.
