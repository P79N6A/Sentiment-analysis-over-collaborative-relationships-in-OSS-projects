Not an easy problem to fix given how it is currently implemented.\r\n\r\nThe rotation lines creates a plane, and then raycasts from the mouse position onto that plane in to find the position of the plane and calculate a good rotation value. When you are looking at the lines at the sharp angle like this, the plane is aligned with the camera so the raycast fails to collide with it and gives the result you are seeing.\r\n\r\nA complex solution that I tried was to make the plane it raycasts against always facing the camera, but there is a lot of complex math and use of quaternions that I couldn't spend the time trying to learn.\r\n\r\nMy simple solution was to disable the rotation axes when you are looking at them at a sharp angle like this. As the TransformControls.js are an external file and not core to the ThreeJS code, you can edit it yourself to suit your needs.

How does is deal with parallel axis (green handle in your gif)? I find radial manipulation more intuitive (tracing a full circle around manipulator should result in 360 degree rotation) but this doesent play well with linear manipulation...
