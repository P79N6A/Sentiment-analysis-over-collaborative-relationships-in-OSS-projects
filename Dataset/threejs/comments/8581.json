I don't know if this is correct, but it seems like three is trying to extract the textures informations from the meta object to do the conversion into a JSON object afterwards.\r\n\r\nA obvious problem occurs when this meta parameter is not filled, but I cant seem to figure out which parameter to pass into this function. Afaik, the toJSON Function is designed to be parameterless. If this is true, the meta object has to be available within the Texture class.\r\n\r\n**Possible quick fix:**\r\n\r\nAfter reading Issue [#8428](https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8428) I simply renamed the Textures' `toJSON` function and was able to stringify a texture of mine.\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n```\r\nlet tex = new THREE.DataTexture(data, 1337, 1337);\r\nlet temp = JSON.stringify(tex);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter brief observation of the temp variable, temp now contains the stringified version of my texture.\r\n**However:** After storing this string in a file using node's fileStream, the final file was 22MB in size, 3x bigger than my original resource (that is currently used to create Textures).\r\n\r\nIs this behaviour correct? I'm not sure if I got the \"right thing\" after the stringification. In addition, is it normal\/predictable that the (possible) textures are this big once serialized?\r\n\r\n\r\n@mrdoob I would highly appreciate if you could take a look at the stuff I stated here. It seems (!) like the toJSON Function for Textures is currently bugged or should be renamed. I don't want to frame this as a bug, I just want to get a high quality answer from someone who understands three in a far better way than I do.\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\nRegards,\r\nMichael","created_at":"2017-03-10T17:33:01.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8581#issuecomment-285732770","id":285732770,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/8581","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NTczMjc3MA==","updated_at":"2017-05-04T16:17:56.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/285732770","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mchlr\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mchlr\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/22155300?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mchlr","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mchlr\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mchlr","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mchlr\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTU1MzAw","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mchlr\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mchlr\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mchlr\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"mchlr","type":"User","id":22155300,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mchlr\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mchlr\/orgs"}},{"index":2,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I have a similar problem, but not because `meta` was undefined.
