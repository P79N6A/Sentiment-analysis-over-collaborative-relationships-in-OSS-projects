I usually do this by first picking a world axis vector (e.g. [0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], etc).  The steps to build the matrix then are (apologies in advance if I remember any details wrong):\n- Calculate group normal vector:\n  - Calculate center of polygon (either mean\/average, or minmax)\n  - For each point: \n    - Calculate triangle formed by point and two of its neighbors\n    -  Add to group normal\n  - Normalize group normal\n- Cross normal with world axis to get a rotation vector (don't forget to normalize afterwards!)\n- Calculate rotation angle with something like 'Math.acos(normal.dot(worldaxis))';\n- Create rotation matrix from crossed vector and angle, e.g. \n  `new THREE.Matrix4().makeRotationAxis(axis, angle) \/\/this might be -angle`\n- Create translation matrix from (negated) center: \n  `new Marix4().makeTranslation(center.negate());`\n- Final matrix will be something like \n  `matrix.copy(rotationmat).multiply(translationmat) \/\/we want the translation applied first, so rotation happens about center`\n","created_at":"2014-09-16T22:21:40.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/5312#issuecomment-55822907","id":55822907,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/5312","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODIyOTA3","updated_at":"2014-09-17T16:40:32.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/55822907","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joeedh\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joeedh\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/3221485?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joeedh","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joeedh\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/joeedh","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joeedh\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjE0ODU=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joeedh\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joeedh\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joeedh\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"joeedh","type":"User","id":3221485,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joeedh\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/joeedh\/orgs"}}]}
