months](https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/commits\/dev\/examples\/js\/loaders\/sea3d), meaning this file must be updated often to stay up to date. If we expect that to happen, project maintainers to be able to quickly and easily update the file.\r\n\r\nI am skeptical that a minified file, sitting in a subfolder with no instructions for updating it, is going to be kept up to date.\r\n\r\n> Many people are interested in this file.\r\n\r\nMany people are also interested in OBJLoader, ColladaLoader, and others. I would be happy with making minified builds of `examples\/js\/loaders\/*` available somehow, but this doesn't seem like the right way to do that. \r\n\r\n@mrdoob if you're open to having a rollup build for the entire loaders directory, I'm glad to look into that, or to open an issue for discussion.","created_at":"2017-02-23T22:58:03.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/10873#issuecomment-282149344","id":282149344,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10873","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjE0OTM0NA==","updated_at":"2017-02-23T23:11:06.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/282149344","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}},{"index":11,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"> but this doesn't seem like the right way to do that.\r\n\r\nAgreed.","created_at":"2017-02-23T23:09:15.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/10873#issuecomment-282151731","id":282151731,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10873","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjE1MTczMQ==","updated_at":"2017-02-23T23:09:15.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/282151731","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/97088?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDg4","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"mrdoob","type":"User","id":97088,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/mrdoob\/orgs"}},{"index":12,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":">>  Many people are interested in this file.\r\n> Is that in SEA3D forum?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nThis is a very popular WebGL benchmark:\r\nhttp:\/\/necromanthus.com\/Test\/html5\/testA_disco.html \r\nAnd I get a bunch of emails from the THREE.js users.\r\n\r\nBut if you agree with \"this doesn't seem like the right way to do that\" let's close this subject.","created_at":"2017-02-24T10:36:14.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/10873#issuecomment-282259955","id":282259955,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/10873","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjI1OTk1NQ==","updated_at":"2017-02-24T10:36:14.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/282259955","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RemusMar\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RemusMar\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars1.githubusercontent.com\/u\/11772787?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RemusMar","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RemusMar\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/RemusMar","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RemusMar\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzcyNzg3","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RemusMar\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RemusMar\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RemusMar\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"RemusMar","type":"User","id":11772787,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RemusMar\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/RemusMar\/orgs"}}]}
