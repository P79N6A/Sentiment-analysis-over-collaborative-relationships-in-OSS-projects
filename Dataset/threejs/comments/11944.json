"data": [{"index":0,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Copied over from @stevenvergenz's comment in the glTF repo, we should be able to reduce a single-node single-mesh glTF file to this:\r\n\r\n* Scene (userland scene)\r\n    * Scene (glTF scene root)\r\n        * Mesh (glTF node)\r\n            * BufferGeometry (mesh)\r\n                * groups (primitives)\r\n            * Material[] (primitive materials)\r\n\r\nI hadn't realized three.js `geometry.groups` existed, so that should simplify things here.\r\n\r\nThe only open question IMO would be, what to do with `extras` and `name` on a \"mesh\" object, since those aren't normally used on a THREE.BufferGeometry:\r\n\r\n- (b) forcibly put `userData` and `name` onto the BufferGeometry, even if it's non-default in three.js.\r\n- (c) decide that three.js ignores `extras` and name on anything that isn't a node, which is already true-ish because things like glTF buffers (which could have `extras` too) are not exposed in the GLTF2Loader output at all.\r\n\r\nWe could also start returning an array of `meshes` and `materials` with the GLTF2Loader response, but that's a slightly different issue for another time.","created_at":"2017-08-14T02:58:13.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11944#issuecomment-322089648","id":322089648,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11944","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMjA4OTY0OA==","updated_at":"2017-08-14T02:59:26.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/322089648","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars3.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1848368?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/donmccurdy","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgzNjg=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"donmccurdy","type":"User","id":1848368,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/donmccurdy\/orgs"}},{"index":1,"author_association":"OWNER","body":"We
