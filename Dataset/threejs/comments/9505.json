And as that\nscales under callback vs. animation-loop-injection vs.\nevent-throw-and-capture regimes, the winner, for me, is the callback\napproach because it takes the least amount of code and is the most\nconservative, among the three, of system resources.\n\nThat's what I give the priority to:  speed.  Because as the system you\nare building becomes more complex, any performance trade-offs you made\nup front quickly come back to haunt you.  At least that is how it has\nbeen for me.\n\nOn 8\/17\/16, tschw notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> The use case makes some sense, but I don't like the idea of adding\n> callbacks.
