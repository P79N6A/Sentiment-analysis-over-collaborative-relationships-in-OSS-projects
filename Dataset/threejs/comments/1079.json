I go through the first file and fill up 100,000 points into a geometry and 100,000 color points into the shader attributes.  Then, when I go through the second file, I create a new geometry and add the first point in the 0th spot of that geometry.  The shader is never reinitialized so pushing a color point on that puts it in the 100,001st spot!  Then when I add it to the particlesystem, the 100,000 points are added and matched with the first 100,000 color points in the shader which are from the first file! So every point in chunks other than the first one get the wrong color!\n\nI'm slightly embarrassed by this, but I was really pleased to see how awesome this can actually turn out.

One is the real color, the other is just the inverse (ie 1-r,1-g,1-b).  It's going to be different color information late, but I just did the inverse so I know I can change it.  I'm setting the ParticleSystem to one of the Attributes and then I want to have it switch to the other one on an event.  I have two links at the top that call showCloudColor and showCloudIntensity.  On the intensity one, I have `blending:THREE.AdditiveBlending` which makes things white when there's a lot of particles close.  I do this so I know that the material is switching, but the color information doesn't follow it!  I even have a setTimeout in the function where I build everything to see if that event will change things after a few seconds ... it doesn't.\n\nSo what's the deal? I've tried all kinds of combos with `geometry.__dirtyColors=true` and `particles.dynamic = true;`  But none of that seems to help me.  How do I change the colors of a ParticleSystem to another color array?  Thanks in advance for your help in this matter.\n","created_at":"2012-02-08T23:45:51.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/1079#issuecomment-3878999","id":3878999,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/1079","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4Nzg5OTk=","updated_at":"2012-02-09T00:17:41.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/3878999","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/landonsilla\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/landonsilla\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1323337?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/landonsilla","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/landonsilla\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/landonsilla","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/landonsilla\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjMzMzc=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/landonsilla\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/landonsilla\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/landonsilla\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"landonsilla","type":"User","id":1323337,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/landonsilla\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/landonsilla\/orgs"}},{"index":11,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Hmmm, seems you set colors via custom attributes, not standard material color atribute.\n\nFor custom attributes equivalent to \"dirty\" flag on the geometry is `needsUpdate` flag on the attribute:\n\n``` javascript\nattributesObject[ \"attributeName\" ].needsUpdate = true;\n```\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/wiki\/Updates\n\nHave a look at custom attibutes examples on how to use it:\n\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/blob\/master\/examples\/webgl_custom_attributes_particles.html#L200\n","created_at":"2012-02-10T00:56:38.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/1079#issuecomment-3899219","id":3899219,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/1079","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTkyMTk=","updated_at":"2012-02-10T00:56:38.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/3899219","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/438022?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/alteredq","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzODAyMg==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"alteredq","type":"User","id":438022,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/alteredq\/orgs"}},{"index":12,"author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you alteredq.

It seems that just applying the color to the vertex when I build it would be most straightforward as opposed to building a custom attribute object in parallel and then applying it to the geometry.  Is that possible?  And, to be clear, I want a very large `ParticleSystem` with each vertex having a potentially different color.  What's the best way to do this?
