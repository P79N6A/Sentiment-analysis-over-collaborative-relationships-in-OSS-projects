The header lists 432486 faces, but the file ends after face 432443. PLYloader is throwing a RangeError trying to read the last few faces, since there's no more data to be had, and the postProcess function where it writes the data into the geometry never gets called, which is why the geometry looks empty.\r\n\r\nIt appears that MeshLab is sensibly taking as many faces as it can get and not worrying about the file not having quite as many as the header promised. \r\n\r\nFundamentally, the bug is with whatever is writing this file. I'd suspect that what's happening is that a few of the faces are invalid (by whatever definition the program that's doing the writing uses; maybe it's skipping faces that reference missing vertices, maybe it's skipping faces that have one vertex referenced twice; who knows...) and as it writes it's skipping the problematic faces. Thus at the beginning when it writes the header it thinks it's going to have 432486 faces, but a few don't get written along the way and it doesn't go back and update the header to reflect the 432443 faces it actually wrote. It's not an uncommon failure mode for PLY writers. Not a huge problem if it happens on the last element in the file, but if it happens on one of the earlier elements, then it corrupts the data in the following element (e.g. if you have a couple of missing vertices, then the first few faces will be incorrectly interpreted as vertices -- with an ascii ply you can usually detect that, but with a binary ply you just get a couple of garbage verts). \r\n\r\nIf desired behavior is silently supporting slightly malformed files like this, the way MeshLab does, it should be easy enough to wrap the call to binaryReadElement in parseBinary to catch the RangeError and ignore it.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, if you're looking to validate a ply implementation, [RPLY](http:\/\/w3.impa.br\/~diego\/software\/rply\/) is probably the canonical C implementation and the code is fairly straightforward.","created_at":"2018-10-15T12:34:30.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14937#issuecomment-429835889","id":429835889,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14937","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyOTgzNTg4OQ==","updated_at":"2018-10-15T12:34:30.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/429835889","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/algrs\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/algrs\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars2.githubusercontent.com\/u\/188884?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/algrs","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/algrs\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/algrs","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/algrs\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4ODg4NA==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/algrs\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/algrs\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/algrs\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"algrs","type":"User","id":188884,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/algrs\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/algrs\/orgs"}},{"index":9,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"> but if it happens on one of the earlier elements, then it corrupts the data in the following element \r\n\r\nHow is it possible to detect this error situation?
