The important thing is that the result is an Object3D or subclass. Adjusting the code from UCSLoader, you might do something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar loader = new THREE.ObjectLoader();\r\nloader.load( config.baseUrl + config.character, function( object ) {\r\n  var geometry;\r\n  object.traverse((node) => {\r\n    if (node.isMesh) geometry = node.geometry;\r\n  });\r\n  \/\/ ...\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't see morph targets in that test file...
