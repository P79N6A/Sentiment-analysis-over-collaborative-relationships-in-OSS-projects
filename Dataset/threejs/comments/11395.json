mesh.\r\n\r\nI have worked around this by writing my own preprocessor that imports the exported mesh, and saves out the animations and skeleton+meshes separately. and then in my engine, I load the animated mesh, and the animations separately.\r\n\r\nThis results in a pretty massive space savings, and also makes it easier to share animations amongst multiple characters\/multiple exports.\r\n\r\nFor instance on one of our main characters, the default export was clocking over 100 megs...\r\n\r\nUsing the preprocessor, gets the size down to around 10 megs.\r\n\r\nMaking your own preprocesser also lets you preprocess some things like adjusting material settings, and culling other things you don't want.\r\n\r\nBut I agree this should be fixed in the exporter.","created_at":"2017-06-04T07:46:16.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11395#issuecomment-306024466","id":306024466,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/11395","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjAyNDQ2Ng==","updated_at":"2017-06-04T07:46:16.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/306024466","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/350247?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/manthrax","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MDI0Nw==","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"manthrax","type":"User","id":350247,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/manthrax\/orgs"}},{"index":1,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Trying
