Then this behavior is confusing. The expected behavior of clicking on a method name is to link to its anchor (or definition in the source). The use case being linking to specific parts of the docs to share with people, which is especially helpful for showing newcomers where documentation is or how specific methods work. Linking to the return type of functions from clicking on the function name itself is counter to any other IDE or documentation example, and I don't think we should be inventing a UI pattern for no reason.\n\nTraditionally return types are annotated in some way, like `[ Vector3 ] .getWorldDirection ([ Vector3  ] vector)`. \n\nThe current behavior has not only confused me but every other developer I've spoken to about it in #three.js. Clicking on a method link only to jump to the top of the page is quite confusing and a symptom of this undesired UI pattern. Saying it's working \"as intended\" may be true, but that intended behavior is not desired for approachable documentation.\n\nAlso, having no way to link to a specific function is an incredible loss for approachable documentation.\n\nAlso why would `.lookAt` be a link if clicking on it does nothing? This is directly going against expected behaviors of links in browsers, and the obvious assumption of a user will be that the documentation pages are broken.\n","created_at":"2015-12-06T23:18:11.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7736#issuecomment-162365780","id":162365780,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/7736","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjM2NTc4MA==","updated_at":"2015-12-06T23:23:14.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/162365780","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/79215?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/AndrewRayCode","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MjE1","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"AndrewRayCode","type":"User","id":79215,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/AndrewRayCode\/orgs"}},{"index":4,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"Sorry, I didn't mean to be curt\u2014I agree the current behavior is confusing.
