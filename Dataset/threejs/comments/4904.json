The reason it is not robust is that a single geometry may be referenced multiple times in a scene graph (e.g. by multiple Mesh nodes) and some of those Mesh nodes may have negative determinant matrices and some may not.\r\n\r\nThe current code you have will invert the geometry for each negative determinant it encounters.  Thus a geometry is shared with two mesh nodes, each of which has a negative determinant, then it will invert the normals \/ switch winding order and then uninvert the normals and switch back the winding order.  Thus giving an incorrect result.  If some meshes have negative determinant and non-negative determinants, then this global modification of a shared geometry will necessarily give incorrect results for some of those nodes.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to modify this geometry, it requires copying the Geometry object, rather than modifying it in place.  THis is still inefficient if a Geometry object is shared across many Mesh nodes as it will create copies for each negative determinant.\r\n\r\nThis idea of modifying the geometry is also not performant.  If you happen to invert a determinant at run time, you need to modify the geometry and reload it to the GPU.  That is pretty brutal.\r\n\r\nThe very best way to solve the issue is what I and @Nimanf proposed in this issue and related PR.
