The Facebook comparison is in my opinion somewhat problematic.  People don't use Facebook because of its API, people use its API because facebook has a billion users.  Facebook's API is horrible but because people need to make money via Facebook we all put up with it.

It is a pain in the butt because three.js doesn't support semver and we can not download the version we need using bower. Installing through bower should be easy, which is now clearly not. If semver is not used, this project would be better off unregistering for bower as it is not compatible with its specifications.\n\nWell, enough with the rant. :-) I would like to offer my help and make a pull request so that this project will be compatible with bower. I even would like to help setting up a nice grunt script for compilation, but also tagging on github. This makes it very easy to maintain for you.
