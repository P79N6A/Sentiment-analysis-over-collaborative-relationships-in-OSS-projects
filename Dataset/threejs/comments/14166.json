I don't think that contributors should be using this as a pattern of contributing. IE. **three should have no _core_ features that rely on shader extensions.** \r\n\r\nIt could be used for prototyping and testing:\r\n\r\n- instead of modify core, `npm run build` and refresh, you can modify example and refresh (without the build)\r\n- ~you can test the current structure of the shaders and decide if they need to be refactored~(@mrdoob doesn't want to do any modifications to the current system though) but for example, instancing could first be prototyped with an extension, and then included in the core like most other stuff behind a preprocessor directive.\r\n- in a 3rd party app, if you want to make a modification to the decision three contributors made, you can opt out and replace it with your own (for example how matrices are handled for instancing, if three only does one thing)\r\n\r\nGood examples are your recent object space normal maps. Say you weren't sure about the convention. It wouldn't have to be a core feature immediately, it could be an extension example until some requirements are met - \"is this a good place for it\", \"is this the right api\", \"are these the right assets\" etc.\r\n\r\nWith instancing, it can get pretty complex if you consider various optimizations, are matrices baked, are they computed, should some of the current shader structure be refactored to better accommodate instancing or not. All of these considerations can slow down the progress of a feature. As is https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/10750 is still unavailable, and i believe it's because of some of these choices\/considerations. Because it's not available for use, it's hard to tell if the current solution is good or not, so it's hard to asses these choices. \r\n\r\nThis can be mitigated by something like this https:\/\/www.npmjs.com\/package\/three-instanced-mesh, but the code in that module is not up to the best practices and standards, because it's monkey-patching three.js on the fly. With more of these extensions in \"staging\" one could have a clearer picture of bigger overview of the landscape. This could indicate areas that need refactoring in the current chunk system, or even in future systems. At least that's how i imagine this should work , could be totally wrong :)\r\n\r\ntl:dr; if there is only to be one example of shader extensions now, or for a while, would it make sense to add instancing to this \r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/threejs.org\/examples\/?q=modified#webgl_materials_modified\r\n\r\n\r\n ","created_at":"2018-06-20T17:25:29.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/pull\/14166#issuecomment-398830834","id":398830834,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/14166","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODgzMDgzNA==","updated_at":"2018-06-20T17:30:03.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/398830834","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/4681282?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/pailhead","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODEyODI=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"pailhead","type":"User","id":4681282,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/pailhead\/orgs"}},{"index":6,"author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"Sorry, @pailhead, I have tried and tried, but I have a very difficult time comprehending your posts.
