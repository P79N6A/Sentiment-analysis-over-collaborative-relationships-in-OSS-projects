It's just not passing the LoadingManager through. \r\n\r\n**edit** here it is #12989 \r\n\r\nI do have a question though. It's clear to see that there exists a difference in behavior with e.g. the `+` URL-escapement between ImgLoader and FileLoader... how much of that matters since loading an MTL causes it to load both types of resources under the hood? I'm anticipating a problem as follows: I use a LoadingManager that turns `+` into `%2B`, and then for the FileLoaders that OBJLoader ends up using it will apply the regular escaping which it already does to turn `%2B` into `%%2B` which will then break the loading of non-images.\r\n\r\n**edit** multiple url munging not happening, and adding the manager that @donmccurdy suggested fixes the issue for me once I updated OBJLoader2 to pass the loader into its MTLLoader.\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-29T04:14:16.000Z","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12983#issuecomment-354395608","id":354395608,"issue_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/12983","node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NDM5NTYwOA==","updated_at":"2017-12-29T07:43:07.000Z","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/repos\/mrdoob\/three.js\/issues\/comments\/354395608","user":{"following_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/unphased\/following{\/other_user}","events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/unphased\/events{\/privacy}","avatar_url":"https:\/\/avatars0.githubusercontent.com\/u\/1542910?v=4","url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/unphased","gists_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/unphased\/gists{\/gist_id}","html_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/unphased","subscriptions_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/unphased\/subscriptions","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI5MTA=","repos_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/unphased\/repos","received_events_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/unphased\/received_events","gravatar_id":"","starred_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/unphased\/starred{\/owner}{\/repo}","site_admin":false,"login":"unphased","type":"User","id":1542910,"followers_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/unphased\/followers","organizations_url":"https:\/\/api.github.com\/users\/unphased\/orgs"}}]}
